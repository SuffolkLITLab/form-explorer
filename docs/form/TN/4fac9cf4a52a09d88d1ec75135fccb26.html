INTRODUCTION 

n 2012, the legislature adopted Public Chapter 943, which required the Administrative Office of 
the  Courts  (“AOC”)  to  conduct  a  study  regarding  veterans  treatment  court  (“VTC”)  programs.  
In addition to attending  two separate VTC conferences/trainings, for a total of nine days of in-
person training, the AOC viewed three webinars on “Working with Veterans and Their Families 
in Drug Courts” at http://www1.spa.american.edu/justice/videos.php, viewed a webcast entitled 
“Coming  Home:    Supporting  Military  Service  Members,  Veterans,  and  Their  Families”  at 
http://recoverymonth.gov/Resources-Catalog/2012/Webcast/08-Coming-Home-Supporting-Our-
Military-and-Their-Families-That-Love-Them.aspx, conducted extensive research, read multiple 
publications,  including  a  novel  (Home  Front  by  Kristin  Hannah),  analyzed  other  states’ 
legislation,  and  contacted  the  persons/entities  listed  below  seeking  input.    While  a  limited 
number  of  groups  did  not  respond  or  declined  to  participate,  the  majority  of  the  listed 
persons/entities met with the AOC in person or via telephone conference.  The AOC wishes to 
thank them for taking the time to participate.

Tennessee    

SCOPE OF REPORT 

uring its VTC trainings as well as its meetings with the interested groups, the AOC discovered 
that many people who are involved with the court system are unfamiliar with military issues and, 
conversely, many people who are involved with the military are unfamiliar with the court system 
and  the  legal  concepts  which  are  relevant  to  the  VTC  issues.    Also,  many  individuals  are 
unfamiliar  with  mental  health  issues.    The  AOC  will  be  distributing  a  copy  of  this  report  to 
Tennessee’s  general  sessions,  trial  and  appellate  court  judges  as  well  as  to  the  legislative 
sponsors and the interested parties with whom the AOC consulted during this study.  Because the 
AOC  believes  it  would  be  helpful  to  educate  everyone  regarding  these  complex  issues,  the 
AOC’s report includes information which was not directly requested by the legislature but which 
the  AOC  hopes  will  be  useful  to  interested  parties  as  well  as  to  courts  which  are  considering 
establishing VTCs. 

DISCLAIMER 

he  AOC  does  not  purport  to  be  an  expert  on  VTCs,  veterans’  benefits,  mental  health  issues, 
substance abuse issues,  or any other topics addressed in this report.  Likewise, the AOC is not 
endorsing any of the groups, persons or websites mentioned in this report.  The AOC is merely 
providing information which was conveyed to it during this study. 

POLICY DECISIONS 

uring its study, the AOC encountered individuals and groups, including both veterans and non-
veterans, who expressed the opinion that veterans and service members who are arrested should 
not be treated differently than other offenders.  This is a policy decision for the legislature, and 
the AOC expresses no opinion regarding the issues raised by those individuals/groups.   

he AOC also notes that some chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union have  expressed 
concern that VTCs may have constitutional implications because similarly-situated offenders are 
being treated more harshly than veterans.  The AOC expresses no opinion regarding this issue, 
but the legislature may wish to consult with the Office of the Attorney General.   

hroughout  this  report,  the  AOC  has  provided  website  addresses  which  the  AOC  believes  the 
reader  will  find  helpful.    However,  because  websites  are  often  reorganized  and  updated, 
addresses to particular pages will change over time.  As of the writing of this report, all website 
addresses are accurate.  If a website does not appear to be accurate, the reader should return to

INTERIM REPORT 

he AOC submitted an interim report to the General Assembly on August 31, 2012.  A copy of 
that report is available upon request.  The report summarized the status of the AOC’s study and 
recommended  that  the  sponsors  of  PC  943  contact  Tennessee’s  congressional  delegation  to 
express  their  support  for  providing  Tennessee  with  additional  Veterans’  Justice  Outreach 
Specialists  and  providing  the  United  States  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (“VA”)  with 
additional funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment.  The AOC also encouraged 
the sponsors to support pending federal legislation which would provide states with federal funds 
for  VTCs.    As  noted  in  the  interim  report,  the  amount  of  money  at  issue  in  the  pending 
legislation is not adequate to fund the numerous VTCs throughout the country, but any funding 
efforts by Congress should be encouraged.   

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS 

lthough some states have legislation which addresses VTCs, the majority of states do not.  The 
legislation which exists varies considerably in scope, with some merely encouraging the creation 
of  specialty  courts/dockets  for  veterans  and  others  providing  a  great  deal  of  detail.    No  states 
mandate the creation of VTCs.  

s  indicated  above,  the  AOC  spoke  with  many  individuals  and  groups,  including  VTC  judges 
and  personnel  throughout  the  United  States,  regarding  the  VTC  issues.  The  majority  of  those 
groups/individuals indicated that much of the existing VTC legislation is too detailed, that it does 
not  provide  courts  with  adequate  flexibility,  and  that  providing  assistance  to  veterans  and/or 
service members within the existing framework of a state’s court system is preferable to utilizing 
limited resources to create an entirely new system. 

fter  studying  this  issue  at  length,  the  AOC  concludes  that  legislation  establishing  a  uniform, 
statewide  VTC  system  in  2013  is  neither  necessary  nor  preferable.    To  the  contrary,  the  AOC 
concludes  that  such  a  system  would  be  detrimental.    The  most  effective  and  cost-efficient 
method of assisting the largest number of men and women1
 who have served this country is to 
permit  each  judicial  district  to  retain  the  discretion  to  address  this  issue  after  considering  the 
available resources and the needs of the relevant populations.  Some states which have narrowly 

                                                 
1 The AOC acknowledges that both men and women have served, and are currently serving, our country.  For the 
sake  of  convenience,  however,  the  term  “he”  will  be  utilized  throughout  this  report.    Each  reference  thereto  will 
apply equally to female veterans and service members.

drawn  their  legislation  have  done  so  for  financial  and  political  reasons,  and  since  Tennessee’s 
courts  have  the  authority  to  create  VTCs  in  the  absence  of  legislation,  there  is  no  benefit  to 
delineating parameters which limit the discretion of the courts and unnecessarily exclude certain 
service members or veterans.   

n addition to providing the courts with necessary flexibility when creating VTCs, the absence of 
legislation will enable courts to adjust their programs as necessary over time.  VTCs are in their 
infancy, and courts learn more  each day  concerning the most effective policies  and procedures 
which  should  be  implemented.    Moreover,  the  AOC  anticipates  changes  in  federal  law  which 
will impact VTCs.  It would be more efficient for courts to make the necessary changes without 
being required to seek, and await, the amendment of one or more statutes each time federal laws 
change or a court’s experience dictates that a previously-implemented policy or procedure is not 
effective.  

ith regard to mental health and substance abuse treatment as well as other services which are 
provided by VTCs, numerous individuals and publications have speculated that the VA does not 
possess adequate resources to provide necessary services to all eligible veterans or to perform all 
of  the  VTC-related  tasks  in  a  timely  fashion.    Likewise,  it  is  the  AOC’s  opinion  that  neither 
Tennessee’s  court  system  nor  the  state  as  a  whole  possesses  adequate  treatment  resources  or 
other pertinent resources to address the needs of individuals who are not eligible for VA benefits 
or whose needs cannot be met entirely, or within a reasonable period of time, by the VA.    

roviding VTCs with necessary resources will require significant expenditures, and the AOC has 
been  unable  to  identify  a  viable,  recurring  state  funding  source.    For  the  reasons  discussed 
elsewhere  in  this  report,  the  AOC  does  not  believe  that  creating  a  fine  for  persons  who  are 
charged  with  criminal  offenses  is  an  appropriate  method  for  funding  VTCs.    Instead,  it  is  the 
AOC’s  opinion  that  the  funding  mechanism  should  be  one  which  affects  all  Tennesseans  as 
opposed to placing the burden entirely on those who are involved in the court system.  Moreover, 
the  AOC  is  concerned  that  Tennessee  is  not  adequately  funding  the  existing  problem-solving 
courts  and  believes  that  that  issue  should  be  addressed  before  the  legislature  attempts  to  fund 
VTCs.  However, as noted in its interim report, the AOC  encourages the  legislature to support 
federal  funding  for  VTCs  and  to  recommend  that  the  VA  provide  Tennessee  with  additional 
Veterans  Justice  Outreach  Specialists.    If  the  legislature  wishes  to  provide  state  funding  for 
VTCs  but  is  unable  to  identify  a  viable,  recurring  funding  source,  the  legislature  may  wish  to 
consider providing courts with non-recurring funds for use by VTCs or for national training for 
Tennessee judges who are considering establishing VTCs. 

he  AOC  wishes  to  emphasize  that  while  legislation  is  not  necessary  in  2013,  the  AOC  will 
continue  to  monitor  this  issue  and  will  propose  any  necessary  legislation  in  2014.    Due  to  the 
recent  creation  of  two  VTCs  in  Tennessee  as  well  as  a  significant  change  in  the  oversight  of 
Tennessee’s  existing  drug  treatment  courts,  the  AOC  believes  that  the  court  system  and  the 
legislature would benefit from gathering additional information in 2013.   

ith regard to the oversight issue, Governor  Bill Haslam recently  issued  Executive Order  No. 
12,  which  transferred  Tennessee’s  Drug  Courts  Program  from  the  Department  of  Finance  and 
Administration’s  Office  of  Criminal  Justice  Programs  to  the  Tennessee  Department  of  Mental

Health  and  Substance  Abuse  Services  (“DMH”).    DMH  plans  to  meet  with  all  of  the  existing 
drug treatment courts to assess their needs and to assist them in accessing necessary funds and 
services.    DMH  also  plans  to  gather  statistics,  including  the  number  of  veterans  who  are 
participating in Tennessee’s drug treatment courts, using the Tennessee Web Based Information 
Technology  System  (“TN-WITS”).    The  AOC  met  with  DMH  regarding  VTC  issues,  and  the 
AOC is hopeful that DMH’s collaboration with the existing drug treatment courts in 2013 will 
assist  those  courts  in  connecting  veterans  and  service  members  with  available  treatment 
resources.  During this transition period, DMH and the AOC also can determine the most cost-
effective and efficient method of incorporating the specialized treatment of veterans and service 
members  into  the  court  system’s  existing  framework.    If  the  AOC  and  DMH  determine  that 
legislation  is  necessary  to  accomplish  that  goal,  the  AOC  will  propose  legislation  in  2014.   
Moreover,  as  noted  elsewhere  in  this  report,  Montgomery  County  and  Shelby  County  recently 
created VTCs.    Deferring legislative action until 2014 will permit those two courts to function 
for one year and to determine what, if any, legislation would benefit VTCs.   

f the legislature prefers to file legislation in 2013, the AOC will share its report with the Office 
of Legal Services and consult with that office if it has questions regarding the parameters of the 
proposed  legislation.    The  Office  of  Legal  Services  also  may  wish  to  refer  to  the  fiscal  note 
support  form  the  AOC  submitted  regarding  HB3394,  which  proposed  the  creation  of  VTCs  in 
2012.  Although the AOC’s understanding of VTCs has changed considerably since it submitted 
that form, the form identifies procedural issues which the Office of Legal Services may wish to 
consider when drafting future legislation.  The AOC’s support form is attached to this report as 
Appendix A.     

WHAT IS A PROBLEM-SOLVING COURT? 

any  groups/individuals  with  whom  the  AOC  met  during  the  course  of  this  study  incorrectly 
assumed  that  a  VTC  requires  limited  resources  and  effort,  and  that  it  does  nothing  more  than 
provide an avenue for the dismissal of participants’ criminal charges following substance abuse 
and/or mental health treatment.  A VTC is a problem-solving court, and many problem-solving 
courts are post-adjudication courts.  This means that the offender has been convicted of one or 
more criminal offenses.  This report will address such things as whether a VTC should be pre-
adjudication or post-adjudication and whether persons charged with particular types of offenses 
should be excluded from eligibility.  However, because a VTC is a hybrid problem-solving court, 
the parameters of a VTC should not be determined in the absence of an accurate understanding 
of problem-solving courts. 

  problem-solving  court  is  a  long-term,  judicially-supervised,  multi-phase  program  through 
which criminal offenders are provided with intensive treatment and other services and are very 
closely  monitored  by  a  team  which  often  includes  a  judge,  prosecutor,  defense  counsel,  law 
enforcement  officer,  probation  officer,  treatment  provider,  case  manager,  program  coordinator 
and program evaluator.  The latter two roles are critical for overseeing the program, evaluating 
which features are producing the desired results, coordinating with members of the community 
who  may  have  services/funds  to  offer,  applying  for  grants  and  other  funding,  and  gathering 
statistics.  Possessing pertinent statistics is a crucial aspect of the program because the statistics

can be used to garner community support, to satisfy reporting requirements for any grants which 
are  awarded,  or  to  support  an  application  for  a  new  grant.    The  National  Drug  Court  Institute 
(“NDCI”)  provides  a  core  competency  guide  (via  the  National  Drug  Court  Resource  Center) 
which  outlines  drug  court

team  members’ 

responsibilities. 

roles 

and 

 

here are many types of problem-solving courts, but the most common type is a drug treatment 
court.    The  types  of  problem-solving  courts  which  exist  in  Tennessee  are  adult  drug  treatment 
courts,  juvenile  drug  treatment  courts,  DUI  courts,  domestic  violence  courts,  family  drug 
treatment courts, mental health courts, and VTCs.   

roblem-solving  courts  are  most  effective  when  the  participants  are  high-risk,  high-need 
offenders and when the courts utilize evidence-based practices, which by definition are based on 
scientifically-sound  research  studies.    A  high-risk  offender  is  a  person  who,  due  to  various 
factors  which  are  evaluated  by  risk  assessment  tools,  are  considered  to  be  at  high  risk  for 
reoffending.  These factors include, but are not limited to, criminal history, social relationships, 
employability,  housing  status,  and  family  situation.    A  high-need  offender  is  a  person  who 
suffers from a significant mental health or  substance abuse issue  and,  as  a  result,  is  in  need of 
intensive treatment.  Many offenders have co-occurring disorders, which essentially means that 
they  have  both  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  issues.    In  addition  to  treating  these  issues, 
problem-solving courts address every other aspect of a participant’s life which could affect the 
participant’s  ability  to  be  successful  upon  graduating  from  the  program.    This  includes  such 
issues  as  education,  employment/vocational  training,  housing,  and  finances.    Addressing  these 
issues  requires  a  great  deal  of  time,  effort,  and  coordination.    Moreover,  depending  upon  the 
availability  of  resources  in  the  community,  providing  the  necessary  services  could  require 
significant expenditures.   

s  a  general  rule,  minor  offenders  and/or  offenders  who  do  not  suffer  from  significant  mental 
health  and/or  substance  abuse  issues  are  not  good  candidates  for  problem-solving  courts.  
Including  them  in  such  a  court  would  be  a  waste  of  the  court’s  limited  resources  and,  more 
importantly, could have an adverse impact on the well-being of the participant.   

hen  a  problem-solving  court  includes  appropriate  candidates,  the  hope  is  that  providing  the 
necessary  treatment  and  support  will  result  in  the  offender  becoming  a  productive  citizen  who 
will not be re-arrested.  This would benefit the individual as well as society as a whole, and it 
also would result in a reduction in expenditures for incarceration and supervision.  If a problem-
solving court wishes to include offenders whose needs differ greatly from one another, the most 
effective  way  of  proceeding  would  be  to  create  separate  tracks  whose  phases  are  adjusted  to 
reflect  the  needs  of  the  offenders  at  issue.    For  example,  offenders  who  require  inpatient 
treatment could be on a different track than offenders who require outpatient treatment. 

ith  regard  to  existing  resources,  the  AOC  does  not  dispute  that  the  judges,  prosecutors,  and 
public  defenders  are  full-time  state  employees.    However,  proponents  of  VTCs  and  other 
problem-solving  courts  must  be  cognizant  of  the  significant  burdens  created  by  these  courts.   
Judges,  prosecutors,  and  public  defenders  have  many  responsibilities  which,  even  absent  the 
existence  of  a  problem-solving  court  in  their  jurisdiction,  require  significant  time  and  effort  to 

  T

perform.  Effective problem-solving courts require a great deal of time, effort and dedication on 
the  part  of  the  team  members.    Tennessee  has  many  problem-solving  courts  and,  despite  their 
many  other  responsibilities,  the  team  members  for  these  courts  are  willing  to  work  overtime 
without additional compensation to complete the tasks associated with a problem-solving court 
because they believe in the concept and are dedicated to helping the participants.   

fter talking with problem-solving court teams and other individuals who are familiar with these 
courts, the AOC is convinced that this extraordinary level of dedication is crucial to the success 
of  a  problem-solving  court.    Mandating  the  creation  of  a  VTC  or  any  other  type  of  problem-
solving  court  would  not  benefit  anyone,  including  the  veterans  and  service  members  whom  a 
VTC is designed to serve.  This would be particularly true for a jurisdiction which already has a 
problem-solving court since the prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges are performing extra 
duties associated with the existing problem-solving court.   

lthough  there  are  many  resources  which  discuss  drug  treatment  courts  and  other  problem-
solving  courts,  NDCI  has  two  particularly-relevant  publications  available  at  no  cost  online  as 
well  as  in  hard  copy  form  (the  purchaser  will  be  charged  for  shipping  if  a  hard  copy  is

lthough VTC issues are not identical to drug treatment court issues, many of the issues are 
very similar, and the AOC found the benchbook to be extremely helpful.  The AOC will refer 
to  specific  benchbook  chapters  throughout  this  report,  and  the  AOC  recommends  that  any 
judges/attorneys  who  are  interested  in  creating  a  problem-solving  court  consult  that

HOW DOES A VETERANS TREATMENT COURT DIFFER FROM OTHER TYPES 
OF PROBLEM-SOLVING COURTS? 

he parameters of a VTC or a veterans court docket vary from state to state and court to court.  
As a general rule, though, a VTC is a problem-solving court which is designed to assist persons 
who  have  served  (or  are  currently  serving)  in  the  military,  who  have  been  charged  with  a 
criminal  offense,  who  are  at  high  risk  for  reoffending  absent  intensive  intervention,  and  who 
have significant mental health and/or substance abuse issues.  A VTC is essentially a hybrid of a 
drug treatment court and a mental health treatment court.  VTCs utilize the drug court model as 
well as the principles of both drug treatment courts and mental health treatment courts.  

he most obvious distinction between a VTC and other problem-solving courts is that the former 
limits participation to current or former members of the military, depending upon the particular 
court’s eligibility requirements.  The other, more subtle, differences are as follows:  (1) The VTC 
team  should  include  at  least  one  member  who  is  familiar  with  veteran/military  culture, 
terminology,  benefits  and  other  veteran/military  issues;  (2)  The  treatment  provider(s)  should

have  experience  with  posttraumatic2
  stress  disorder,  traumatic  brain  injury,  military  sexual 
trauma, and other issues often associated with military service; (3) Mentors who are veterans or 
service  members  should  be  utilized;  (4)  The  risk-assessment  procedure  will  differ  slightly 
because a veteran-specific risk-assessment tool has yet to be identified or developed; and (5) The 
partners with whom such a court must coordinate include veteran-specific service providers.   
 
Drug  courts  have  10  key  components  which,  in  Tennessee,  are  codified  in  Tennessee  Code 
Annotated section 16-22-104.  These components were slightly modified to create the following 
10  key  components  for  VTCs:  (1)  VTCs  integrate  alcohol,  drug  treatment,  and  mental  health 
services with justice system case processing; (2) Using a non-adversarial approach, prosecution 
and defense counsel promote public safety while protecting participants’ due process rights; (3) 
Eligible  participants  are  identified  early  and  promptly  placed  in  the  VTC  program;  (4)  VTCs 
provide  access  to  a  continuum  of  alcohol,  drug,  mental  health  and  other  related  treatment  and 
rehabilitation services; (5) Abstinence is  monitored by frequent alcohol  and other  drug testing; 
(6)  A  coordinated  strategy  governs  VTC  responses  to  participants’  compliance;  (7)  Ongoing 
judicial  interaction  with  each  veteran  is  essential;  (8)  Monitoring  and  evaluation  measure  the 
achievement  of  program  goals  and  gauge  effectiveness;  (9)  Continuing  interdisciplinary 
education promotes  effective VTC planning, implementation,  and operations;  and (10)  Forging 
partnerships  among  VTCs,  Veterans  Administration,  public  agencies,  and  community-based 
organizations generates local support and enhances VTC effectiveness.  Additional explanations

these  components  can  be 

found  on 

HOW WERE VETERANS TREATMENT COURTS CREATED?  

he  first  VTC  was  created  by  Judge  Robert  Russell  in  Buffalo,  New  York,  in  2008.    Judge 
Russell  presided  over  a  drug  treatment  court  as  well  as  a  mental  health  treatment  court  at  that 
time,  and  he  noticed  that  one  of  the  participants,  who  happened  to  be  a  veteran,  was  having 
difficulty  thriving  in  the  treatment  court  program.    Two  of  Judge  Russell’s  employees  were 
veterans, so he asked those employees to talk with the offender.  During the subsequent meeting, 
the  employees  discovered  that  the  defendant  wanted  to  be  around  other  Vietnam  veterans,  so 
they connected him with a vet group at the VA.  Judge Russell subsequently noticed a significant 
difference in the offender’s demeanor and in his willingness to become an active participant in 
his  recovery.    Based  in  large  part  upon  this  experience,  Judge  Russell  created  a  separate 
treatment court/docket for veterans.    

hile  there  are  many  factors  involved  and  anyone  who  is  considering  creating  a  VTC  should 
seriously consider participating in formal training, the bottom line is that veterans are exposed to 
harsh realities to which the majority of individuals are never exposed, have difficulty readjusting 
to  civilian  life,  are  much  more  successful  when  involved  in  a  structured  program,  and  benefit 
greatly  from  being  surrounded  by  individuals  who  understand  the  military  culture.    In  short, 
Judge Russell found that justice-involved veterans who are struggling with mental health and/or 
                                                 
2 Some websites and publications refer to “post-traumatic” as opposed to “posttraumatic.”  The AOC is utilizing the 
latter in this report because the VA and the DSM-IV-TR utilize that spelling.

substance abuse issues are much more likely to succeed and to become productive members of 
society  if  they  are  in  a  structured  environment  in  which  other  veterans  are  involved.    Those 
veterans include other offenders as well as mentors, court personnel and/or members of the VTC 
team.  The camaraderie  and peer pressure to succeed motivate the veterans to do well, and the 
VTC simulates a military unit in which the judge functions as the commanding officer, mentors 
serve as the fire team leaders, court staff members (probation officer, law enforcement, treatment 
providers,  etc.)  simulate  the  company  staff,  and  the  veterans/service  members  serve  as  the 
troops.  

s with other problem-solving courts, the hope is that utilizing VTCs will result in a reduction in 
recidivism  which,  ultimately,  should  result  in  lower  expenditures  for  prosecution  and 
incarceration as well as related costs such as healthcare and treatment costs for offenders who are 
repeatedly  incarcerated  or  who  fail  to  become  productive  citizens  and  rely  on  government-
funded assistance as they age even if they are not incarcerated.  

udge  Russell,  his  VTC  team,  and  his  other  staff  members  are  well  respected  at  the  national 
level.  They are very active in communicating with the VA and other federal agencies regarding 
VTCs  and  in  educating  judges  and  other  court  personnel  who  are  considering  creating  VTCs.  
Consistent with information garnered by the AOC during its conversations with judges in other 
states, however, Judge Russell acknowledges that creating a court which has community support 
and  effective  coordination  and  communication  among  all  necessary  governmental  and 
community  resources  takes  considerable  time  and  effort.    Judge  Russell also  recognizes,  as  do 
other VTC judges, that the VA has limited resources and that, as a result, it will not be possible 
for the VA to have a representative assigned to every VTC.   

HOW ARE TENNESSEE’S COURTS CURRENTLY SERVING VETERANS AND 
SERVICE MEMBERS? 

TCs were established in Montgomery County and Shelby County in 2012.  Davidson County 
has a VTC docket associated with its mental health treatment court.  Washington County also has 
a mental health treatment court, and while it does not have a separate docket for veterans, a VA 
employee works with the court to assist eligible veterans in accessing VA benefits.    

lthough  Knox  County  does  not  have  a  VTC,  Knox  County  and  other  Tennessee  counties 
participate  in  Veterans  Stand  Down  events,  which  are  discussed  elsewhere  in  this  report.  
Moreover,  the  Knox  County  Public  Defender’s  Office  and  District  Attorney’s  Office  are 
implementing  a  program  called  Homeless  Veterans  and  Civilians  Legal  Assistance  Initiative, 
which  is  an  effort  to  end  chronic  homelessness.    This  program  serves  both  veterans  and  non-
veterans who are involved in the court system.  When possible, the program refers veterans to the 
VA  for  services.    However,  many  of  the  veterans  do  not  qualify  for  those  services  due  to  the 
nature of their discharge or the length of their service.  This initiative also links the veteran or 
civilian  with  a  case  manager  who  assists  the  person  in  accessing  housing  and  securing 
employment.

Tennessee’s  problem-solving  courts  currently  serve  veterans.    Judicial  districts  which  do  not 
operate problem-solving courts order necessary mental health and substance abuse treatment for 
appropriate offenders, including veterans and service members, as a condition of the offenders’ 
community-based sentences.   

POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA, 
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, DEPLOYMENT STRESSORS, AND READJUSTMENT 
CHALLENGES 

  VTC  should  rely  upon  qualified  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  treatment  providers  to 
make  informed  decisions  regarding  what,  if  any,  treatment  is  necessary.    However,  the  AOC 
believes that it would be beneficial for courts to have a basic understanding of the conditions at 
issue. There are many websites and other resources which provide information regarding mental 
health and substance abuse issues, and the AOC encourages courts to consult those resources in 
addition to reading the summaries below.   

eployment Stressors 

atricia  Watson,  Ph.D.,  is  employed  by  the  VA’s  National  Center  for  PTSD,  and  she  made  a 
presentation regarding military culture at the National Association of Drug Court Professionals’ 
(“NADCP”) national conference.  According to Dr. Watson, service members are exposed to the 
stressors  listed  below  during  deployment.    Many  of  these  stressors  are  present  regardless  of 
whether the service member is engaged in a combat mission or in a non-combat mission such as 
a humanitarian or peacekeeping mission.

In  addition  to  identifying  these  stressors,  Dr.  Watson  recommended  that  courts  consult  the 
following resources to learn more about military culture:   

he National Center for PTSD’s Military Culture Course, which can be found at the following 

website: http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/ptsd101/course-modules/military_culture.asp 

he  Combat  Stress  Intervention  Program’s  Military  101  Course,  which  can  be  found  at  the 

following website:  http://www.copingaftercombat.com/military101.php  

he  Citizen  Soldier  Support  Program’s  courses,  which  can  be  found  at  the  following  website:   

http://www.aheconnect.com/citizensoldier/courses.asp   

he  Center  for  Deployment  Psychology’s  Military  Cultural  Competence  Course,  which  is  75 
minutes  in  length.    This  course  is  summarized  as  follows:    “This  interactive  online  training 
course  provides  an  overview  of  military  culture  to  include  organizational  structure,  rank, 
branches  of  service,  core  values,  and  demographics  as  well  as  similarities  and  differences 
between  the  Active  and  Reserve  components.  It  is  intended  to  assist  civilian  mental  health 
providers  in  better  understanding,  communicating  and  effectively  interacting  with  Service 
  This  course  can  be  found  at  the  following  website:  
members  and  their  families.” 
http://deploymentpsych.org/training/training-catalog/military-cultural-competence  

eadjustment Challenges 

he military functions as a family for veterans and service members, who often are unsure how, 
or if, they fit in once they return to their “normal” lives.  Moreover, deployment and/or trauma 
are likely to influence veterans’ views of the world, including changing how they interact with 
the community, altering  the way  they view  mankind/humanity,  changing  how  safe they  feel in 
the  world,  making  them  question  their  spiritual  or  religious  beliefs,  and  causing  them  to  feel 
differently about themselves.  As a consequence, persons who have served in the military may 
have readjustment challenges even if they do not suffer from substance  abuse or mental health 
issues.  Courts  may  wish  to  consider  that  possibility  when  dealing  with  veterans  and  service 
members regardless of whether the person at issue is participating in a VTC.  

eadjustment issues may be more common for members of the National Guard and the Reserves 

because they do not return to a “military family” on a military base following deployment.   

ental Health Issues and Resources Generally 

osttraumatic  stress  disorder  (“PTSD”)  is  not  suffered  exclusively  by  veterans,  but  veteran-
specific  information  regarding  PTSD,  traumatic  brain  injury  (“TBI”),  military  sexual  trauma 
(“MST”),  and  depression  can  be  found  on  the  website  for  the  National  Center  for  PTSD 
(www.ptsd.va.gov/).  This Center was created within the VA in 1989.  Dr. Eric Kuhn, who is Co-
Director  for  Education  for  the  Center,  made  a  presentation  at  the  Veterans  Treatment  Court 
Planning Initiative.  The AOC attended this presentation and has included much of Dr. Kuhn’s 
information in the mental health summaries below.  In addition to referencing the VA’s website,

Dr.  Kuhn  also  recommended  that  courts  consult  the  website  for  the  International  Society  for 
Traumatic Stress Studies (http://www.istss.org/Home.htm). 

he  AOC’s  mental  health  summaries  also  include  information  learned  by  the  AOC  during  the 
presentation  of  Lori  Simms,  Ph.D.  at  NADCP’s  annual  conference.    Dr.  Simms  works  at  the 
Nashville  VA  Medical  Center’s  PTSD  Outpatient  Clinic,  and  she  recommended  that  courts 
consult  the  VA’s  website  as  well  as  the  website  for  the  Defense  Centers  of  Excellence  for 
Psychological  Health  and  Traumatic  Brain  Injury  (www.dcoe.health.mil)  for  additional 
information regarding veterans’ mental health issues.     

inally, an individual who works for a VTC in a state other than Tennessee recommended that 
courts consult www.seekingsafety.org.  According to that website, “Seeking Safety is a present-
focused  therapy  to  help  people  attain  safety  from  trauma/PTSD  and  substance  abuse.   The 
treatment is available as a book, providing both client handouts and guidance for clinicians.” 

rauma Generally 

ilitary  service  traumas  fall  into  the  following  general  categories:  (1)  Traditional  combat 
traumas  such  as  firefights,  seeing/handling  mutilated  bodies,  witnessing  death/dying,  killing, 
providing  medical  care  in  the  field,  and  becoming  a  captive/POW;  (2)  Non-traditional  combat 
traumas  such  as  witnessing  atrocities  and  abusive  violence  and  being  exposed  to  guerilla-style 
warfare  (improvised  explosive  devices  (“IED”),  suicide  bombs,  civilian  combatants);  (3)

Traumatic Brain Injury 

   

BI  is  a  traumatically-induced  physiological  disruption  of  brain  function  as  manifested  by  at 
least  one  of  the  following:    (1)  loss  of  consciousness  (which  might  consist  of  being  dazed  or 
dizzy as opposed to actually being unconscious); (2) loss of memory regarding events before or 
after the injury; (3) alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; or (4) focal neurologic 
deficit that may or may  not  be transient.   TBI is  the designation  for the  injury/trauma itself as 
opposed to the symptoms which result from the injury, and the type of trauma (the direction and

compiled in many different years, and all of them vary slightly. The AOC has not independently corroborated the 
accuracy  of  any  of  the  statistics  but  is  merely  providing  them  to  give  the  reader  a  general  idea  of  the  traumas  to 
which veterans and service members have been exposed.

brain is affected by the impact. 

 blunt trauma/closed head injury can result from the following, among others:  explosion/blast 
(IED,  rocket  propelled  grenade,  land  mine,  etc.),  motor  vehicle  crash  (any  type,  including 
airplanes),  fall  (including  jumps  by  paratroopers),  or  a  non-deployment  related  event  (sports 
injury, construction accident, bicycle accident, physical abuse/assault).  A penetrating/open head 
injury is an injury caused by an object crushing, stretching, or entering the head, and it can result 
from  the  following,  among  others:  gunshot,  stab  wound,  penetration  of  fragments/shrapnel,  or 
some types of skull fractures. 

here  are  four  grades  of  TBI.    TBI  severity  can  be  mild  (essentially  a  concussion),  moderate, 
severe  (coma),  or  penetrating  (open  head  injury).    Symptoms  are  physical,  cognitive,  and 
behavioral/emotional.  Most TBIs are mild, and mild TBIs (“mTBI”) can affect brain function, 
particularly  if  the  individual  suffers  from  multiple  TBIs  since  the  effects  are  cumulative.    An 
mTBI  can  affect  memory,  concentration,  learning,  information  processing,  language,  problem-
solving, decision-making, impulse control, and thinking.  It can also cause behavioral problems.   

s with substance abusers, the symptoms suffered by  persons diagnosed with mTBI should be 
considered by courts and treatment providers during the recovery process since those symptoms 
can  affect  the  person’s  behavior  or  the  person’s  ability  to  understand,  remember,  and  comply 
with the court’s directives.   However, the AOC  believes it is unlikely  a  court will  encounter a 
large number of offenders who suffer exclusively  from mTBI.  The majority of mTBI victims’ 
symptoms are resolved within 4-12 weeks.  Individuals who continue to exhibit symptoms likely 
have post-concussive syndrome or co-morbidities, and the court and treatment provider will be 
dealing  with  PTSD,  substance  abuse,  depression  or  other  co-occurring  disorders  in  addition  to 
dealing with the mTBI symptoms.   

ilitary Sexual Trauma 

very  VA  medical  center  has  an  MST  Coordinator,  and  the  VA  is  legally  required  to  provide 
care  for  physical  and  mental  health  conditions  related  to  MST.    MST  refers  to  trauma  which 
“resulted  from  a  physical  assault  of  a  sexual  nature,  battery  of  a  sexual  nature,  or  sexual 
harassment  which  occurred  while  the  veteran  was  serving  on  active  duty  or  active  duty  for 
training,” and sexual harassment refers to “repeated, unsolicited verbal or physical contact of a 
sexual nature which is threatening in character.”  38 U.S.C. § 1720D.   As with TBI, MST is the 
designation for the trauma itself as opposed to the symptoms which result from that trauma, and 
MST  can  be  experienced  in  the  absence  of  combat  or  deployment.    This  fact  is  relevant  to  a 
court’s determination regarding whether VTC eligibility should be limited to persons who were 
deployed and/or who engaged in combat.       

While some sexual assaults involve physical force or lack of consent due to intoxication, some 
individuals are victims of “command rape,” in which the victim is pressured into sexual activity 
through the threat of consequences for failure to comply or the implication that compliance will 
result  in  better  treatment.    Command  rape  is  particularly  troubling  because  of  the  victim’s 
repeated and continued exposure to the perpetrator as well as the victim’s complete dependence 
upon  the  perpetrator,  sometimes  during  a  period  in  which  the  victim  is  involved  in  life-

threatening situations.  This can result in wariness toward authorities and institutions, including 
law enforcement and judges, particularly if the person with whom the victim comes into contact 
is the same gender as the perpetrator.   

Courts should be cognizant of the fact that both males and females can experience MST.  Indeed, 
more  than  one  study  has  reflected  that  the  number  of  males  who  experience  MST  exceeds  the 
number  of  females.    One  study  showed  that  between  2002  and  2008,  61,126  men  experienced 
MST and 59,690 women experienced MST.  While the percentage of female victims relative to 
the  number  of  females  in  the  military  exceeds  the  percentage  of  male  victims,  this  should  not 
minimize the fact that there are many male victims.     

Courts  also  should  be  aware  that  there  is  a  very  high  rate  of  PTSD  among  persons  who  are 
victims of MST and that the rate is even higher among combat veterans.  Other diagnoses which 
are  most  commonly  associated  with  MST  are  depression  and  other  mood  disorders  (including 
suicidal  thoughts  or  suicide  attempts),  psychotic  disorders,  mania/bipolar  disorders,  and  eating 
disorders,  among  others.    Victims  also  can  suffer  from  employment  problems,  relationship 
problems, readjustment issues, spirituality (crisis of faith) issues, and physical health problems.  
Many  of  the  symptoms  and  adverse  consequences  are  similar  to  those  suffered  by  victims  of 
trauma  generally  and  PTSD  specifically.    As  with  victims  of  other  traumas,  individuals  who 
experience MST often self-medicate, and this can lead to substance abuse issues. 

The VA recognizes that  it is in the relatively  early  stages  of  understanding  many  MST-related 
issues.  For more information regarding MST and the available VA resources, see the VA’s MST 
website at http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/pages/military-sexual-trauma-general.asp.  Courts also 
may  wish  to  consult  the  PowerPoint  presentation  made  by  Margret  Bell,  Ph.D.,  who  is  on  the 
MST Support Team at the VA’s Office of Mental Health Services.  Dr. Bell made a presentation 
at  the  NADCP  conference,  and  her  PowerPoint  handout  is  available  on  NADCP’s  website  at 
http://www.ndci.org/conferences/2012/Sessions/E_sessions/E-21.pdf.  

Female  veterans  might  feel  more  comfortable  seeking  treatment  from  the  VA’s  “Women 
Veterans Healthcare Center,” which “offers women [v]eterans a private, comfortable setting with 
all  female  providers  and  state-of-the-art  equipment.”    In  Tennessee,  this  center  is  located  in 
Nashville.    For  healthcare  purposes,  Tennessee  is  located  in  VISN  9,  which  is  a  geographical 
area  designated  by  the  VA.    VA  facilities  which  are  located  in  VISN  9  but  are  not  located  in 
Tennessee  can  be  utilized  by  veterans  who  reside  in  Tennessee.    For  additional  information

development  of  PTSD.    The  AOC  possesses  statistics,  risk  factors,  and  diagnostic  criteria  for 
PTSD,  and  the  AOC  will  provide  this  information  upon  request.    However,  because  the  AOC 
anticipates  that  the  courts  and  the  legislature  will  defer  to  mental  health  experts  regarding 
diagnosis and treatment issues, the AOC will limit its discussion to a general overview.   

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 

  M

14 
 

In lay terms, an individual who suffers from PTSD has been exposed to trauma involving actual 
or threatened injury to himself or to another person, and this exposure  causes the individual to 
feel  intense  fear,  helplessness,  or  horror.    Such  an  individual  subsequently  suffers  from 
flashbacks  and/or  nightmares,  avoids  discussing  the  trauma  or  the  symptoms  it  is  causing,  has 
difficulty  sleeping,  suffers  from  hyperarousal/hypervigilance,  often  has  substance  abuse  issues, 
has  difficulty  interacting  with  others  and  functioning  normally  in  daily  life,  is  unable  to  cope 
with  routine  daily  stressors,  and  is  prone  to  anger,  verbal  and  physical  aggression,  and 
interpersonal violence.  A PTSD sufferer will be “super aware” of his surroundings, will be alert 
to  any  potential  sign  of  danger,  and  will  often  perceive  danger  where  no  threat  exists.    The 
individual also may have an inappropriate response to routine stimuli, such as “hitting the deck” 
upon hearing a car backfire.  These symptoms have the potential to inhibit an individual’s ability 
to  react/behave  appropriately  in  routine  civilian  scenarios  and  to  impair  the  ability  to  make 
decisions and process information.   

he  VA  and  others  have  noticed  an  increase  in  the  number  of  Vietnam  veterans  who  are 
exhibiting symptoms of PTSD.  This may be due to the fact that as they get older and retire they 
have  more  free  time  and  less  structure,  and  they  are  refocusing  on  their  combat  experiences.   
This  would  be  difficult  for  them  under  any  circumstances,  but  some  have  lost  their  support 
systems  due  to  the  relatively  recent  deaths  of  family  members  and  friends,  and  they  do  not 
possess adequate coping mechanisms.  Participating in therapy can be difficult for any veteran or 
service member because the person must confront painful memories and feelings, but it could be 
particularly  difficult  for  some  Vietnam  veterans  since  they  have  avoided  dealing  with  those 
memories for many years. 

TSD sufferers appear to be at higher risk for suicide.  The VA has a National Crisis Line (1-

800-273-TALK), which is a suicide hotline. 

o-Occurring Disorders 

any victims of trauma suffer from multiple physical and mental health conditions.  The VA is 
learning  more  about  these  conditions  and  is  adjusting  its  treatment  protocols  as  needed.    For 
example, if a veteran suffered from PTSD as well as substance abuse issues, the VA previously 
attempted  to  treat  the  substance  abuse  issue  before  addressing  the  PTSD.    The  VA  now 
recognizes  that  veterans  often  self-medicate,  using  alcohol  and  other  drugs  in  an  attempt  to 
control PTSD symptoms.  Whether a veteran uses depressants or stimulants depends upon which 
symptoms he is attempting to control.  As a result of these discoveries, the VA now attempts to 
treat the PTSD prior to, or simultaneously with, the substance abuse issues.  In contrast, PTSD 
and  TBI  share  many  symptoms  but  PTSD  is  easier  to  diagnosis  and  more  is  known  about 
effectively treating PTSD than TBI, so the VA focuses on treating the PTSD.   

creenings and DOD/VA Files 

ervice members who participate(d) in OEF/OIF are being screened for PTSD and TBI, and this 
likely  will  be  reflected  in  their  medical  records.    The  screening  consists  of  a  one-page,  self-
reported  assessment.    Because  this  is  not  an  anonymous  assessment  and  service  members  are 
reluctant to admit to anything which could adversely affect their careers, these records may not 

  T

be particularly helpful.    The  timing of  the assessment also may  result  in  an under-reporting of 
mental health issues due to the delay in experiencing those symptoms.  One veteran noted that 
many service members “lose it” 12-18 months after returning from deployment because it takes 
that much time for their mental health and/or substance abuse issues to have an adverse impact 
on their relationships with family and friends and to cause them to lose their jobs, get  arrested 
and/or become homeless.   

SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES 

s the AOC previously noted, the AOC is not an expert on substance abuse issues or any other 
issues which are discussed in this report.  The AOC gathered information during interviews and 
trainings,  and  it  is  conveying  information  which  it  believes  the  interested  groups  will  find 
helpful.    The  information  below  was  gathered  from  numerous  sources.    However,  a  primary 
source of the information was Steve Hanson, who is the Acting Associate Commissioner of the 
New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.  Mr. Hanson has an M.S. 
Ed, is a licensed mental health counselor, and is a credentialed addiction counselor. Mr. Hanson 
made  a  presentation  on  addiction/psychopharmacology  at  a  national  training  attended  by  the 
AOC. 

easons for Alcohol/Drug Use 

here are many reasons  a veteran or service member might consume alcohol and/or take other 
legal or illegal drugs.    With regard to alcohol, it is generally  accepted that  the  military  culture 
encourages excessive alcohol consumption.  When service members are not on duty, they often 
are drinking alcohol.   

oreover, as noted above, substances often are used in an attempt to self-medicate.  Persons who 
have mental health  issues  will  use  these substances to help themselves sleep and  to  treat other 
symptoms.    Unfortunately,  these  substances  often  exacerbate  their  symptoms  and  lead  to  self-
destructive, reckless and/or violent behavior. 

ersons  who  have  physical  injuries  use  substances  in  an  attempt  to  control  their  pain.    While 
there  is  the  potential  for  abuse  and/or  addiction  even  when  someone  is  under  the  care  of  a 
licensed physician, there is an increased potential for abuse when the person is in combat.  In that 
circumstance,  service  members  often  are  given  the  discretion  to  gauge  how  much  pain 
medication is required to control their pain.   

or some individuals, the use of substances will have no adverse consequences.  For others, the 

ramifications will include addiction.   

ecovery Challenges 

hile the initial decision  to use alcohol or  other drugs  is voluntary  in  nature, for  some people 
dependence  on  drugs  is  an  involuntary  result  which,  in  very  simplified  terms,  results  from  the 
flip  of  a  switch  in  the  brain.    Regardless  of  whether  the  continued  drug  use  is  voluntary  or

  P

  F

  W

16 
 

involuntary,  however,  its  effects  on  the  brain  can  be  dramatic  and  long-lasting.    Indeed,  brain 
scans  reflect  that  prolonged  drug  use  alters  the  manner  in  which  the  brain  functions,  primarily 
impacting  the  portions  which  affect  critical  thinking  and  the  regulation  of  emotions.    The 
resulting  poor  judgment  skills  and  unregulated  emotions  will  impede  abusers  during  the  early 
stages of any attempt at recovery.  Months into the recovery, the abusers’ brains still will not be 
functioning properly, so  for many abusers long-term treatment is necessary.  Moreover, people 
who  are  recovering  from  addictions  feel  guilty  about  things  they’ve  done  and  how  they’ve 
treated  people,  and  their  instinct  is  to  drink/drug  to  deal  with  those  feelings.    If  the  substance 
abuse  started  at  an  early  age,  it  is  likely  that  the  abuser  never  developed  the  “normal”  coping 
skills that non-abusers developed.   

ourts and treatment providers should recognize that there is a difference between patients who 
become dependent on prescription drugs and other types of drug abusers.  Veterans often will fall 
into the former category.  These addicts will not see themselves as true drug addicts or criminals, 
and  they  may  be  reluctant  to  seek  treatment  or,  when  ordered  to  seek  treatment,  may  have 
difficulty accepting that they need the treatment. 

lthough there must be sanctions for non-compliance with court orders, courts should consider 
the  complexity  of  the  recovery  issues,  including  the  substances’  physiological  effects  on  the 
brain,  when  determining  the  nature  of  an  appropriate  sanction.    For  example,  revocation  of  an 
alternative sentence or removal from a problem-solving court program would not necessarily be 
an  appropriate  response  to  a  dirty  drug  screen.    Relapse  rates  for  drug  addicts  are  40-60%.   
Accepting an offender into a problem-solving court program or ordering treatment as a condition 
of  an  alternative  sentence  does  not  immediately  cure  the  addiction.    Recovery  takes  time  and 
failures  are  inevitable,  so  if  a  court  takes  the  position  that  it  will  not  tolerate  any  dirty  drug 
screens, the  addict will feel helpless because he  knows  that  he will fail  at  some point, and the 
court’s  position  on  that  issue  will  virtually  guarantee  that  the  addict’s  recovery  will  not  be 
successful.  Sanctions also may interfere with treatment, so judges should consult with all team 
members,  including  treatment  providers,  before  making  a  final  decision  regarding  the 
appropriate reaction to a violation. 

ourts  also  should  be  aware  that  drug  use  impacts  memory.    For  example,  methamphetamine 
“kills”  certain  brain  cells,  while  cocaine  “tires”  them.    This  should  be  considered  by  courts 
during the initial phases of recovery, and those phases should not include complicated or abstract 
concepts.  Providing  a  problem-solving  court  participant  with  a  calendar  which  lists  the 
participant’s  court  dates  and/or  treatment  appointment  dates  (or  providing  the  calendar  but 
requiring  the  offender  to  note  the  dates  on  the  calendar)  would  be  helpful,  but  courts  should 
anticipate that some users, due to memory deficiencies, will miss appointments/hearings.  As one 
drug court conference presenter noted, for some offenders, appearing in court on a particular date 
may be the most the court can expect that person to accomplish initially.  The offender might be 
intoxicated when he appears in court and there would have to be an appropriate sanction for that 
behavior,  but  the  court  also  should  recognize  that,  for  some  people,  the  mere  fact  that  they 
appear in court on the required date is a step in the right direction and deserves some recognition.  
The AOC spoke with someone who has extensive experience with drug treatment courts, and she 
encourages courts to recognize that “the lights are not on” for 90-120 days after an addict stops 
using.  For that reason, courts also should reiterate the treatment court rules periodically.

Regardless  of  whether  an  offender  is  being  considered  for  participation  in  a  problem-solving 
court,  is  being  placed  on  probation,  or  is  serving  a  period  of  incarceration,  the  person  in  a 
position of authority, whether it is a judge or a TDOC/jail employee, should defer to substance 
abuse  experts  when  determining  what,  if  any,  treatment  is  appropriate  for  an  offender.    The 
experts can differentiate between casual use, abuse, and dependence, and the treatment for each 
differs  greatly.    A  casual  user  may  require  no  treatment,  abuse  often  can  be  successfully 
addressed  through  outpatient  treatment,  and  dependence  often  requires  inpatient  treatment.  
There also are different types/levels of inpatient and outpatient treatment.  Mandating the wrong 
type  of  treatment,  whether  too  intensive  or  not  intensive  enough,  is  a  waste  of  resources  and, 
more  importantly,  can  negatively  impact  the  offender.    More  is  not  always  better.    Substance 
abusers  and  individuals  who  suffer  from  mental  health  issues  also  should  be  reassessed 
periodically  because  treatment  needs  may  change  as  the  person’s  condition  improves  or 
deteriorates.   

he AOC is not oblivious to the fact that some offenders will intentionally deceive the court, will 
never  comply  with  the  court’s  orders,  and  may  not  be  good  candidates  for  a  problem-solving 
court  or  an  alternative  sentence.    Addicts  are  skilled  at  manipulation.    The  AOC  merely  is 
identifying issues  the court may wish to  consider  when dealing with  offenders  who potentially 
suffer from substance abuse issues.   

VARIOUS METHODS OF ASSISTING VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS 

reating  a  VTC  is  one  way  in  which  courts  can  assist  veterans  and  service  members,  and  this 
report provides guidance regarding issues courts must address when creating a VTC.  However, a 
particular  judicial  district  may  not  have  an  adequate  number  of  veterans/service  members  to 
justify  the  creation  of  a  VTC,  may  not  possess  adequate  resources  to  create  a  VTC,  or  may 
decline  to  create  a  VTC  for  another  reason.    Moreover,  even  if  a  judicial  district  or  county 
creates a VTC, not all veterans and service members will be eligible to participate.  However, it 
does  not  follow  that  the  court  system  will  be  precluded  from  providing  assistance  to  justice-
involved veterans and service members who do not participate in a VTC.   
 

Veterans and Service Members Without Mental Health and/or Substance Abuse Issues 

 VTC is a treatment court which should only service individuals whose mental health and/or 
substance  abuse  issues  warrant  their  inclusion  in  this  type  of  long-term,  intensive  treatment 
program.    If  a  justice-involved  veteran  does  not  have  mental  health  issues  or  substance  abuse 
issues,  it  would  not  be  appropriate  for  that  person  to  participate  in  a  VTC.    However,  the 
veteran’s defense attorney, probation officer, or other court personnel could assist the veteran in 
enrolling  with  the  VA  for  the  purpose  of  receiving  any  financial  benefits  or  other  benefits  for 
which the veteran is eligible.  This report provides those individuals with links to websites and 
publications which will aid them in assisting veterans. 

ervice  members  are  not  eligible  for  veterans’  benefits.    However,  due  to  the  possibility  that 
criminal  charges  and/or  the  nature  of  the  disposition  thereof  could  adversely  affect  a  service 
member’s  career,  a  prosecutor  may  wish  to  consider  the  person’s  status  when  determining  the 

  T

   

  C

most appropriate manner in which to proceed.  As noted below, though, incarceration may be the 
most appropriate disposition for certain offenders regardless of their military service.  Moreover, 
during this study multiple individuals, including veterans and members of the military, indicated 
that some service members deserve to have their security clearances revoked or to be discharged 
from the military due to the arrest itself (depending upon the nature of the offense) or due to the 
arrest  when  considered  in  conjunction  with  the  offender’s  past  behavior.    Members  of  the 
military emphasized that commanders will retain their authority to discipline a service member 
in  whatever  manner  the  commander  deems  appropriate  regardless  of  how  the  criminal  charges 
are resolved in the civilian court.      
 

Incorporating Veterans and Service Members into Existing Problem-Solving Courts 

he AOC interviewed many people who currently work for problem-solving courts such as drug 
treatment  courts  and  mental  health  courts,  and  the  majority  stated  that  they  serve  veterans  in 
those  courts.    In  lieu  of  creating  an  entirely  new  problem-solving  court,  which  would  further 
stretch  their  already  limited  resources  (both  financial  resources  and  other  resources  such  as 
personnel)  and/or  may  not  be  warranted  given  the  limited  number  of  veterans  in  the  judicial 
district  or  county,  these  courts  could  adjust  their  existing  programs  to  address  veteran-specific 
issues.    This  could  include  recruiting  veteran  mentors,  adding  a  team  member  who  is  familiar 
with  military/veteran  issues,  utilizing  the  VA’s  medical  centers/clinics  or  other  treatment 
providers  who  are  familiar  with  veteran-specific  issues,  and  assisting  the  veterans  in  securing 
applicable veterans’ benefits.   

epending upon the number of veterans or service members at issue, the problem-solving court 
could  incorporate  the  additional  services  into  its  existing  docket,  address  veterans  and  service 
members  separately  during  a  portion  of  its  existing  docket  (for  example,  hearing  all  veterans’ 
and service members’ cases during the first hour of a three-hour problem-solving court docket), 
or  create  a  separate  docket  for  veterans  and  service  members  who  are  participating  in  the 
problem-solving  court.    Adapting  an  existing  problem-solving  court  to  specifically  address 
veterans’  issues  will  require  additional  expenditures,  but  the  expenditures  will  be  significantly 
lower than creating an entirely new problem-solving court. 
 

Judicial Districts or Counties Which Do Not Have Existing Problem-Solving Courts 

f a judicial district or county which currently does not have a problem  solving court (or has a 
problem-solving  court  for  which  the  offender  does  not  qualify)  encounters  veterans  or  service 
members who have mental health and/or substance abuse issues, the judge could order the person 
to  receive  treatment  as  a  condition  of  probation  or  Community  Corrections.    This  could  be 
ordered through a pretrial disposition such as pretrial diversion or judicial diversion, or it could 
be ordered through a post-disposition sentence.  Military service is considered when determining 
the appropriateness of diversion and/or an alternative sentence because it is part of the offender’s 
social  history.    For  some  offenders,  a  period  of  confinement  may  be  ordered  in  addition  to  a 
community-based sentence such as probation or Community Corrections.   

s  previously  noted,  it  is  important  for  any  treatment  providers  to  be  familiar  with  veteran-
specific  issues.    In  addition  to  securing  the  services  of  treatment  providers  who  have  the

expertise  to  treat  veterans,  courts  should  consider  incorporating  the  other  veteran-specific 
services.    For  example,  veteran  mentors  and  camaraderie  among  justice-involved  veterans  and 
service members are VTC components which can be incorporated into a court even if the court 
does not establish a VTC.  This could be done by creating a special docket for veterans/service 
members or by grouping their cases together on an existing docket.   

f the court is not willing or able to create a special docket or grouping, the court could hear the 
cases in the same manner the cases are currently being heard, but the court could add an optional 
mentoring component to the existing court procedures.  However,  grouping the veterans’ cases 
together has two primary benefits.  First, these offenders benefit greatly from camaraderie, peer 
pressure,  and  peer  support.    Therefore,  having  them  on  the  same  docket  will  give  them  the 
opportunity  to  interact  and  to  support  each  other.    Moreover,  staff  members  of  existing  VTCs 
and  veterans  dockets  noticed  that  the  participants  often  share  information  with  each  other 
regarding VA benefits/procedures and other available resources while they are waiting for court 
to begin.  This builds rapport among the participants and also assists them in accessing resources 
which will assist them in becoming productive citizens. 
 

Incarceration 

he  majority  of  veterans  and  non-veterans  to  whom  the  AOC  spoke  during  this  study 
acknowledged  that  serving  in  the  military  should  not  give  anyone  a  free  pass  to  commit  a 
criminal  offense.    After  considering  all  appropriate  factors,  the  prosecutor,  defense  counsel, 
judge and/or jury may conclude that a conviction is warranted and that a period of incarceration 
is appropriate for a particular offender.  These factors could include such things as the nature of 
the  offense,  the  victim’s  preference,  the  existence  and  severity  of  any  mental  health  and/or 
substance  abuse  issues,  and  the  causal  connection,  if  any,  between  those  mental  health  and/or 
substance abuse issues, the defendant’s military service, and/or the commission of the offense.   

s discussed elsewhere in this report, incarceration affects VA benefit eligibility.  However, if a 
veteran  is  sentenced  to  a  term  of  imprisonment  in  the  Tennessee  Department  of  Correction 
(“TDOC”), TDOC will assist the veteran in securing any VA benefits to which the veteran will 
be  entitled  upon  release  from  incarceration  and  also  will  assist  the  veteran  regarding  other 
reentry  issues.    For  more  information  on  reentry  issues,  see  the  section  of  this  report  which 
addresses the Tennessee Reentry Collaborative.

ISSUES WHICH MUST BE RESOLVED WHEN CREATING A VETERANS 
TREATMENT COURT 
 
If  a  county  or  judicial  district  opts  to  create  a  VTC,  there  are  numerous  issues  which  must  be 
addressed prior to creating  such  a court.   Therefore,  during the initial VTC  planning phases, a 
court should consider the issues which are listed below in addition to considering all of the other 
issues which are relevant to problem-solving courts.  As noted elsewhere in this report, the AOC 
strongly  encourages  judges  to  undergo  professional  VTC  training,  to  consult  with  Tennessee 
judges  who  currently  are  presiding  over  problem-solving  courts,  and  to  read  The  Drug  Court 

20 
 

Judicial Benchbook, which can be found at http://www.ndci.org/publications/more-publications/-
drug-court-judicial-benchbook, prior to establishing a VTC.   

he most important  thing  for  courts,  the legislature, and other interested parties to understand, 
however, is that there is not a “right” or “wrong” way to structure a VTC.  The goal is to assist as 
many  veterans  and  service  members  as  resources  and  public  safety  considerations  will 
reasonably  allow.    In  the  absence  of  restrictive  legislation,  a  court  will  have  the  flexibility  to 
adjust  the  parameters  as  necessary  following  a  VTC’s  initial  implementation.    The  AOC 
recommends that courts reevaluate their positions regarding each issue after establishing VTCs if 
the programs’ statistics  and/or the  courts’  experiences  indicate that  a  different  approach would 
benefit the participants or if the eligibility criteria are so broad that the courts lack the capacity to 
process the applications of the large number of potentially-eligible offenders.  Initially, though, 
courts should consider these issues:         
 

1.  Should  eligibility  be  restricted  to  currently-serving  service  members,  anyone  who  has 
ever  served  in  the  military  (including  those  who  served  in  the  National  Guard  or 
Reserves) regardless of whether they qualify as veterans for the purpose of receiving VA 
benefits, only those individuals who qualify as veterans for the purpose of receiving VA 
benefits, or a combination thereof?  
 

2.  What procedure should the VTC use to identify veterans and/or service members?

3.  Should the VTC be located at the general sessions court level or the circuit/criminal court 

4.  Should  the  VTC  be  a  pre-adjudication  court,  a  post-adjudication  court  (including 

probation violators), or a combination thereof? 
 

5.  Should  the  nature  and/or  number  of  an  alleged  offender’s  current  or  prior  criminal 
offenses automatically disqualify an otherwise eligible candidate from participation?   
 

6.  Should  persons  with  certain  medical  conditions  automatically  be  disqualified  from 

participation in a VTC? 
 

7.  Should participation be limited to persons who can establish a causal connection between 
the military service, the substance abuse and/or mental health issues, and the commission 
of the offense(s) at issue? 
 

8.  Should participation be limited to combat veterans?

What Is The Definition Of “Veteran”? 

s noted above, the first issue  is whether  the  VTC participants  should  be limited  to currently-
serving service members, anyone who has ever served in the military, only those individuals who 
have served  in  the  military and who qualify  as  veterans  for the purpose of receiving treatment 
through  the  VA,  or  a  combination  thereof.    During  this  study,  the  AOC  discovered  that  many 
people,  including  the  author  of  this  report,  incorrectly  assumed  that  anyone  who  served  our 
country as a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, whether on 
active duty or as a member of the National Guard or the Reserves, was considered a veteran upon 
discharge.    However,  for  the  purpose  of  receiving  veterans’  benefits  through  the  VA,  the 
Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs (“TDVA”), or any other department or group which 
provides veterans with benefits, the definition of “veteran” varies depending upon what benefit 
the person is seeking and from which department/group the person is seeking the benefit.  These 
issues  must  be  considered  when  establishing  the  parameters  of  the  VTC  because  potential 
participants’  ineligibility  for  VA  healthcare  benefits  or  other  VA  benefits  will  have  a  fiscal 
impact on the VTC. 

he  definition  of  “veteran”  for  benefit  eligibility  purposes  often  involves  consideration  of  the 
type of service (active duty vs. National Guard/Reserves), dates of service, length of deployment, 
if any, and type of discharge.  Currently, the types of discharge are as follows:  (1) Honorable; 
(2) General Under Honorable Conditions; (3) Other Than Honorable; (4) Bad Conduct; and (5) 
Dishonorable.    The  first  three  are  handled  administratively,  but  the  latter  two  can  only  be 
imposed  through  the  military’s  court-martial  system.    As  a  general  rule,  only  veterans  who 
received an honorable discharge or a  general discharge under honorable  conditions are eligible 
for medical/treatment  benefits as well as  non-medical benefits through the VA.  Veterans who 
received  a  dishonorable  discharge  typically  are  not  eligible  for  any  medical  or  non-medical 
benefits.    Veterans  who  received  an  other  than  honorable  or  bad  conduct  discharge  are  not 
eligible for medical benefits, and their eligibility for non-medical benefits is often discretionary 
and varies by the type of benefit.   

n  arrest  or  conviction  will  not  affect  a  veteran’s  discharge  status.    In  other  words,  a  veteran 
who received an honorable discharge could not be downgraded to a dishonorable discharge even 
if he was subsequently convicted of first degree murder.  In contrast, it is possible for a veteran 
to  seek  a  discharge  upgrade.    However,  it  is  the  AOC’s  understanding  that  this  is  a  time-

consuming  process  and  that  it  is  rarely  successful.    If  an  attorney  wishes  to  assist  a  veteran  in 
pursuing a discharge upgrade, the attorney should consider contacting Tennessee’s congressional 
delegation  to  request  a  copy  of  the  veteran’s  service  records.    Congressional  delegations  often 
can obtain more information than a veteran can obtain through standard Department of Defense 
and VA procedures.  The congressional delegation also can be contacted if an attorney/court is 
having difficulty obtaining a copy of a veteran’s medical records.  However, VA Form 10-5345, 
which is discussed elsewhere in this report, should initially be utilized when attempting to secure 
a copy of a veteran’s medical records.    
 

Veterans vs. Service Members 

or  a  court  with  limited  resources,  it  likely  will  be  necessary  to  narrowly  define  the  target 
population.    Specifically,  the  court  may  wish  to  limit  the  eligible  participants  to  veterans  who 
qualify  for  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  treatment  through  the  VA.    However,  courts 
should be aware that there will be costs associated with VTC participation even if the veteran is 
eligible for the VA’s medical and non-medical benefits.    

f  a  VTC  has  significant  resources,  it  may  wish  to  broaden  the  target  population  to  include 
anyone  who  has  been  discharged  after  serving  as  a  member  of  the  Army,  Navy,  Air  Force, 
Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, whether on active duty or as a member of the National Guard or 
the  Reserves.    Due  to  the  nature  of  their  discharge  or  to  other  relevant  factors,  some  of  these 
individuals will not be eligible for VA benefits.  However, VTCs have observed that members of 
the National Guard and Reserves who have mental health or substance abuse problems may have 
greater  difficulty  readjusting  to  civilian  life  because  they  do  not  return  to  a  military  base 
following  deployment  and,  therefore,  do  not  have  the  full  emotional  support  of  the  “military 
family”  or  other  support  services  provided  to  service  members  who  return  to  a  military  base 
following  deployment.    Indeed,  when  they  return  from  deployment,  members  of  the  National 
Guard and Reserves are  given 90 days of leave.  While this will allow the person to reconnect 
with his family and friends and to deal with other issues which arose during his deployment, it 
also  has  the  unintended  effect  of  isolating  the  individual  from  similarly-situated  military 
personnel.  

ome  people  to  whom  the  AOC  spoke  expressed  the  opinion  that  anyone  who  receives  a  bad 
conduct  discharge  or  dishonorable  discharge  should  be  excluded  from  participation  in  a  VTC.   
This is a policy matter for the courts and the legislature as opposed to the AOC.  When resolving 
this issue, the courts/legislators may wish to consider the purpose of VTCs.  If the purpose is to 
provide treatment to people who served our country, the nature of the person’s discharge may not 
be relevant.  Moreover, the behavior which ultimately resulted in a bad conduct or dishonorable 
discharge may have  been  caused  by the  mental  health and/or  substance  abuse  issues  for  which 
the  individual  is  now  seeking  treatment.    This  is  particularly  true  for  individuals  who  were 
discharged  before  the  military  understood  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  and  the  impact  it  can 
have on an individual’s behavior.  Finally, the mere fact that an offender is deemed eligible for 
participation  in  a  treatment  court  does  not  guarantee  that  the  offender  will  in  fact  participate.  
The  VTC  team  ultimately  determines  which  of  the  eligible  offenders  should  be  permitted  to 
participate,  and  that  team  has  the  authority  to  consider,  among  other  things,  the  nature  of  the 

  F

  I

  S

23 
 

behavior or series of infractions which resulted in the offender’s discharge as well as the number 
of times the service member was warned/counseled about his behavior prior to discharge.     

ourts  also  should  consider  whether  service  members  should  be  eligible  for  participation  in  a 
VTC.    There  are  practical  problems  associated  with  these  individuals,  including  the  fact  that 
VTC programs are long-term programs.  Active duty service members are frequently deployed or 
are moved to another military base, so for those individuals a long-term program may not be a 
practical resolution of their criminal charges.   

n the other hand, although there are costs associated with things other than treatment in a VTC, 
one factor for a court to consider when determining whether to include service members is the 
fact  that  they  often  can  receive  treatment  at  no  cost  on  a  military  base.    Moreover,  when 
community-based  treatment  is  required,  the  service  member’s  insurance  might  cover  the 
associated  costs.    See  http://www.tricare.mil  for  more  information  regarding  TRICARE.    This 
assumes, of course, that the military does not discharge the service member following his arrest.  
If the service member is discharged, he will not be eligible for on-base treatment and, depending 
upon  the  nature  of  the  discharge,  may  not  qualify  for  VA  benefits.    Assuming  the  service 
member is discharged, if he has a mental health or substance abuse issue, participation in a VTC 
may assist him in transitioning from the military to civilian life.   

he  AOC  encourages  the  judge,  prosecutor  and/or  the  entire  VTC  team  to  establish  a 
relationship  with  the  military  commanders  whose  service  members  the  VTC  is  likely  to 
encounter.    If  the  VTC  team  understands  a  commander’s  philosophy  and  the  commander 
understands  the  VTC’s  role,  they  are  more  likely  to  resolve  each  case  in  the  most  appropriate 
manner while respecting and retaining their respective professional discretion.  For example, if a 
service member’s history and the nature of his offense so warrant, a commander might agree not 
to revoke  a service member’s security clearance  or discharge him if he successfully completes 
the VTC program.  Similarly, a prosecutor might agree not to pursue the civilian charges if the 
commander  agrees  to discipline the service member and/or provide  necessary  mental health or 
substance  abuse  treatment  through  the  military’s  system.    Finally,  the  commander  may  inform 
the VTC team that a particular service member will lose his security clearance or be discharged 
regardless of how the civilian courts proceed regarding the charged offense(s).   
 

How Many Veterans Reside in Tennessee? 

ccording to TDVA’s most recent estimate based upon 2009 data, there are 501,907 veterans in 
Tennessee.    For  purposes  of  this  statistic,  a  veteran  is  defined  as  “a  person  who  served  in  the 
active military, naval, or air service and who was discharged or released under conditions other 
than  dishonorable.”    38  C.F.R.  §  3.1(d).    TDVA’s  annual  report,  which  can  be  viewed  at 
http://www.state.tn.us/veteran/news_releases/VAAnnualReport2011Lr.pdf,  also  reflects  how 
many of the 501,907 veterans reside in each county. 

either  the  TDVA  nor  any  other  entity  gathers  statewide  statistics  regarding  the  number  of 
Tennessee veterans who are arrested for, or convicted of, criminal offenses.  Moreover, as noted 
above,  TDVA’s  statistics  do  not  include  service  members  who  currently  are  serving  on  active 
duty or in the National Guard or Reserves, and they only include former service members who

were  “discharged  or  released  under  conditions  other  than  dishonorable.”  Although  certain 
individuals  are  excluded  from  TDVA’s  statistics,  courts  may  wish  to  declare  those  individuals 
eligible for participation in a VTC.   

he  AOC  was  unable  to  locate  an  agency  or  other  source  which  has  identified  the  number  of 
individuals who reside in Tennessee and who previously served in the military but do not qualify 
as  “veterans”  for  TDVA  purposes.    Likewise,  the  AOC  does  not  know  how  many  service 
members currently reside in Tennessee, although the AOC assumes that number fluctuates due to 
the  nature  of  military  service.    Finally,  the  AOC  is  not  able  to  predict  how  many  former  or 
current members of the military will be arrested in Tennessee in general or in a particular judicial 
district  or  how  many  of  the  arrestees  will  have  mental  health  and/or  substance  abuse  issues 
which would make them eligible for participation in a VTC. 
 

What Procedure Should Courts Use To Identify Veterans And/Or Service Members? 

arly intervention is critical, and courts should attempt to identify veterans as quickly as possible 
following arrest.  Individuals who have substance abuse and/or mental health issues are reluctant 
to seek or accept help, and this is especially true for veterans.  However, someone who is in jail 
and/or is charged with a criminal offense has often “hit rock bottom” and will be motivated to do 
anything, including participating in a treatment court, if it could have a positive impact on his life 
or  liberty.    Moreover,  the  earlier  the  veteran  is  identified  the  earlier  the  veteran  can  begin  the 
sometimes  lengthy  process  of  obtaining  proof  of  his  status  as  a  veteran  and  completing  the 
necessary paperwork to receive treatment and other benefits.   

dditionally,  regardless  of  whether  a  jurisdiction  creates  a  VTC,  the  jurisdiction  may  wish  to 
identify  veterans  and/or  service  members.    Even  absent  an  official  VTC,  the  arrestee’s  status 
could  assist  the  stakeholders  in  determining  the  most  appropriate  manner  in  which  to  proceed 
with  the  arrestee’s  case  and/or  to  assist  the  arrestee  in  determining  whether  he  is  entitled  to 
veterans’ benefits.   

t  is  important  for  the  legislature  to  permit  the  courts  to  retain  the  discretion  to  determine  the 
most  efficient  manner  of  identifying  veterans  and  service  members.    One  jurisdiction  might 
conclude  that  the  law  enforcement  entity  which  performs  the  booking  function  for  the  county 
should  identify  those  individuals  while  another  jurisdiction  might  conclude  that  the  judicial 
commissioners  should  perform  this  function.    As  a  practical  matter,  courts  may  wish  to  take 
referrals  from  anyone  who  possesses  relevant  information,  including  mental  health  providers, 
attorneys, probation officers, bail bondsmen, or military officials, among others.   

n addition to determining which entity/person should gather this information, each jurisdiction 
must determine the most effective method of gathering the information and communicating it to 
the court.  With regard to the latter, stamping “veteran” on the arrest warrant or sending a list to 
the relevant court staff via email could be adequate.  With regard to the former, courts may find 
that active duty service members will be easier to identify than veterans because they likely will 
list  the  military  as  their  employer  on  a  jail’s  intake  form.    With  regard  to  veterans,  it  is  the 
AOC’s understanding that many individuals who have served our country will not acknowledge 
being veterans upon inquiry because they are confused about whether they officially qualify as 

  T

  E

  A

  I

  I

25 
 

veterans for the purpose of receiving VA benefits.  This is particularly true for persons who have 
served in the National Guard or the Reserves.  Therefore, it may be preferable to ask, “Have you 
ever  worn  the  uniform?”  or  “Are  you  currently  serving  or  have  you  ever  served  in  the  Army, 
Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard  or in the National Guard or Reserves?” as the 
initial inquiry.  Another option would be to ask, “Have you ever served in the military?”  These 
inquiries will capture a broad range of service members and veterans (regardless of whether they 
qualify  as  “veterans”  for  VA  purposes),  and  the  court/prosecutor/defense  counsel  can 
subsequently determine the exact nature of the service and identify any programs/services which 
might  be  available  to  that  person.    Some  VTCs  include  veterans  who  served  other  countries 
while others limit participation to veterans of the United States Armed Forces.    

t is also the AOC’s understanding that veterans often will deny being veterans because they are 
embarrassed  about  being  arrested,  they  do  not  think  they  will  be  treated  fairly  if  they  identify 
themselves  as  veterans,  or  for  various  other  reasons.    For  example,  persons  who  have 
experienced MST often are unresponsive to this inquiry because they have been traumatized and 
are  reluctant  to  discuss  their  military  service  or  associate  themselves  with  the  military  in  any 
way.  Although these individuals initially will not be identified as veterans, the attorney who is 
retained  or  appointed  to  represent  such  an  individual  often  will  discover  the  person’s  status 
during  the  course  of  the  representation.    The  attorney  can  then  communicate  this  status  to  the 
court.         

n  a  related  issue,  judges  and  attorneys  must  be  aware  that  some  individuals  who  have  never 
served  in  the  military  will  identify  themselves  as  veterans  in  an  attempt  to  receive  favorable 
treatment.  As with all potential VTC participants, their status can be verified through the VA.  
The  VA  currently  is  conducting  a  pilot  project  for  an  electronic  system  which  would  allow 
jails/courts  to  send  the VA  a  list  of  persons  who  have  been  arrested  and  to  receive  a  response 
which  indicates  whether each  person  is  currently  serving,  or  has  ever  served, in  the  armed 
forces.  That system is not yet available nationwide. 
 

Should The VTC Be Presided Over By A Trial Court Or General Sessions Court Judge? 

ourts must next decide whether the VTC will be presided over by a general sessions court judge 
or  a  circuit/criminal  court  judge.    The  AOC  recommends  that  judges  who  are  creating  VTCs 
consult with judges who currently are presiding over other problem-solving courts to identify the 
pros and cons of each option, including the availability of state or county probation services in 
each  court.    There  are  jurisdictional  issues  and  other  legal  issues,  but  courts  may  ultimately 
conclude that the most important factor is which judge has adequate time and interest.   

f time constraints preclude  a single  judge from  presiding over  every  VTC  session,  judges  can 
consider  rotating.    However,  consistency  is  important  in  problem-solving  courts,  so  it  is 
preferable to have  an offender appear before the same judge each time the offender appears in 
court.

Should The VTC Be A Pre-Adjudication Court, A Post-Adjudication Court, 
Or A Combination Thereof? 

he AOC recommends that courts which are considering creating VTCs consult with judges who 
currently preside over problem-solving courts regarding the pros and cons of establishing a pre-
adjudication  court,  a  post-adjudication  court,  or  a  combination  thereof.    This  issue  also  is 
discussed  in  §§  2.14-2.20  of  The  Drug  Court  Judicial  Benchbook,  which  can  be  found  at 
http://www.ndci.org/publications/more-publications/-drug-court-judicial-benchbook. 

here are many factors which must be considered when making this determination, and the AOC 
will  defer  to  those  who  have  more  expertise  than  the  AOC.    However,  judges  who  are 
considering establishing pre-adjudication VTCs may wish to consider the fact that someone who 
is granted pretrial diversion or whose prosecution is not pursued by the district attorney pursuant 
to prosecutorial discretion pending successful completion of a VTC program will not be eligible 
for  supervision  by  a  state  probation  officer.    Therefore,  there  will  be  costs  associated  with 
supervising those offenders.  Also, as noted in the benchbook referenced above, “If there is little 
consequence  for  failing  to  complete  the  program,  outcomes  tend  to  be  poorer.    Thus,  pre-plea 
diversion  models  tend  to  have  less  impressive  effects  because  participants  who  are  terminated 
are essentially put back in the same position, legally speaking, as when they were first arrested.”   

onversely,  judges  who  are  considering  establishing  post-adjudication  VTCs  may  wish  to 
consider  the  impact  a  conviction  could  have  on  service  members  and  veterans.    The  impact 
incarceration could have on veterans’ benefits is discussed elsewhere in this report.  With regard 
to  service  members,  the  general  rule  is  that  if  someone  is  convicted  of  misdemeanor  domestic 
assault  or  a  felony  or  is  under  an  order  of  protection,  that  person  loses  the  right  to  possess  a 
firearm.    See  18  U.S.C.  §§  922(g),  -921(a)(20);  T.C.A.  §§  39-13-111(c)(6),  36-3-625,  39-17-
1307.  This could adversely impact a service member’s ability to continue serving in the military.  
There are some exceptions for military-issued weapons, but those exceptions do not apply if, for 
example, a misdemeanor domestic  assault conviction is at issue.  18  U.S.C. §  925.  Moreover, 
regardless  of  the  firearms  prohibition  provisions  and  any  applicable  military/government 
exceptions,  there  is  the  potential  that,  subject  to  the  discretion  of  the  commander,  the  service 
member will lose his security clearance and/or will be discharged from the military if he enters a 
plea  pursuant  to  judicial  diversion  (which  the  commander  could  consider  equivalent  to  a 
conviction  even  though  a  judgment  is  not  entered  and,  therefore,  there  is  not  a  conviction),  is 
convicted  of  any  criminal  offense,  or  is  under  an  order  of  protection.    This  would  have  a 
financial impact on the service member as well as the service member’s family.   

s  noted  elsewhere  in  this  report,  however,  the  arrest  itself  could  result  in  revocation  of  the 
security clearance and/or discharge from the military regardless of the nature of the disposition.  
That decision is entirely within the discretion of the service member’s commander, and it often 
depends  upon  the  service  member’s  history  and  the  nature  of  the  offense  for  which  he  was 
arrested.

Nature And/Or Number Of Prior And Current Criminal Offenses 
 
There  are  practical  and  jurisdictional  issues  which  must  be  considered  when  determining  the 
parameters of a VTC, but public safety should be an overriding consideration.  As noted below, 
however, the AOC is not stating that only minor offenders should be permitted to participate in a 
VTC.  The AOC believes that the best way to approach this issue is for the court to consult with 
the local prosecutor, defense bar, victims’ rights groups, treatment providers, and other relevant 
stakeholders  before  establishing  the  eligibility  parameters  for  a  VTC.    After  setting  those 
parameters, functioning within that system for an appropriate period of time, and considering any 
available  statistics  and  first-hand  observations,  the  court  and  other  VTC  team  members  should 
periodically reevaluate and redefine the parameters as necessary.    
  
When setting the initial parameters, the first question courts must answer is whether eligibility is 
based upon the offense for which the offender is charged or the offense for which the offender 
was  convicted.    This  will  depend  upon  whether  the  VTC  is  a  pre-adjudication  court,  a  post-
adjudication court,  or a  hybrid.   If it  is a pre-adjudication court, the charged  offense  will be at 
issue because there has not yet been a conviction.  If it is a post-adjudication court, the charged 
offense,  conviction  offense,  or  both  may  be  considered.    Similarly,  whether  persons  who  are 
charged  with  (or  convicted  of)  misdemeanors,  felonies,  or  both  are  eligible  to  participate  in  a 
VTC may depend upon whether the court is presided over by a general sessions court judge or a 
trial court judge.   

he  VTC  team  also  must  consider  whether  someone  who  is  alleged  to  have  committed  a 
“violent” or “serious” offense should be excluded from eligibility for a VTC.  If the VTC team 
intends  to  adopt  such  an  exclusion,  the  team  must  clearly  define  those  terms  so  there  is  no 
confusion regarding the parameters.  However, the AOC believes that a  case-by-case approach 
might be preferable to an across-the-board exclusion.   

reviously, there was a trend to exclude violent offenders from participation in problem-solving 
courts.    One  reason  for  this  trend  was  that  victims’  rights  groups  and  other  interested  groups 
were  opposed  to  “special  treatment”  for  violent  offenders.    As  a  result,  it  was  politically 
unpopular  to  assist  those  offenders.    While  such  groups’  concerns  still  exist  and  should  be 
considered,  it  also  should  be  recognized  that  many  individuals  who  work  for  problem-solving 
courts or are involved in setting policy for those courts at the national level no longer believe that 
violent offenders should automatically be excluded.  Indeed, these offenders are often the most 
likely offenders to fall within the high-risk, high-need category that a problem-solving court is 
designed to serve.  Many minor offenders do not fall into this high-risk, high-need category and, 
therefore,  are  not  good  candidates  for  VTCs.    Moreover,  many  of  these  “serious”  or  “violent” 
offenders qualify for, and are presumed to be good candidates for, community-based supervision 
such  as  probation  or  Community  Corrections.    If  such  an  offender  has  a  mental  health  or 
substance abuse issue, participation in a VTC would actually promote public safety because VTC 
participants are supervised much more closely than individuals who are sentenced to probation 
or Community Corrections. 

hile the violent/serious offender issue is relevant to all problem-solving courts, it is particularly 
relevant to a VTC.  A service member is trained to always be in possession of his weapon.  As a 

  T

  P

  W

28 
 

result,  upon  re-entering  civilian  life,  many  veterans  continue  to  carry  loaded  weapons.  
Therefore,  regardless  of  whether  a  weapon  is  used  during  the  offense  at  issue,  there  is  a 
significant possibility that a veteran who commits a criminal offense will be armed when he does 
so.  This would be true even if the offense is a relatively minor offense such as reckless driving, 
which is a common offense for veterans of OIF/OEF.  During their deployment, service members 
drive  at  a  high  rate  of  speed  and  utilize  evasive  maneuvers  (rapid  lane  changes,  unpredictable 
movements, etc.), often driving down the middle of the road.  If they fail to do so, they increase 
their  chances  of  being  killed  or  seriously  injured  by  an  improvised  explosive  device  (“IED”).   
When  a  service  member  returns  from  deployment,  this  type  of  driving  can  result  in  a  ticket 
and/or  an  arrest.    Driving  under  the  influence,  domestic  assault,  and  other  assaultive  offenses 
also  are  relatively  common  among  justice-involved  veterans,  particularly  if  they  have  mental 
health or substance abuse issues.   

hen making eligibility determinations, however, a VTC should recognize that including violent 
offenders in a problem-solving court may adversely affect eligibility for grant funding.  Even if a 
VTC  opts  for  broadly-defined  eligibility  to  give  the  VTC  team  the  flexibility  to  evaluate  each 
case  on  its  own  merits,  the  VTC  may  wish  to  automatically  exclude  certain  offenders  such  as 
those who are charged with sex offenses or offenses which result in the death or serious bodily 
injury of a victim.  Judges should consider, among other things, whether the available treatment 
facilities will treat the offenders at issue.  For example, some treatment facilities will not accept 
sex  offenders  or  violent  offenders.    A  VTC  which  is  utilizing  such  a  treatment  facility  may, 
therefore, choose to exclude those types of offenders from eligibility for the VTC.  With regard 
to sex offenders, a  VTC should consider that some of the participants will be victims of MST.  
Requiring  those  individuals  to  participate  in  a  VTC  which  includes  sex  offenders  could  be 
detrimental. 

inally, in addition to considering the nature of the current offense, courts may wish to consider 
the offender’s criminal history, including whether the criminal activity began prior to or after the 
offender’s  military  service.    As  a  general  rule,  if  the  person  is  not  a  good  candidate  for 
community  supervision,  even  if  it’s  the  type  of  intensive  supervision  utilized  in  a  VTC,  the 
person should be excluded from the program.   
 

Medical Conditions 
 
Judges  who  currently  are  presiding  over  VTCs  in  states  other  than  Tennessee  noted  that  some 
veterans are taking narcotics to deal with chronic pain.  If the veteran is unwilling or unable to 
stop  taking  those  narcotics,  the  veteran  likely  will  not  be  a  good  candidate  for  a  VTC,  which 
often  precludes  the  use  of  drugs.    In  the  alternative,  if  deemed  appropriate  by  a  qualified 
treatment  provider,  the  court  could  allow  the  individual  to  participate  in  the  VTC  but  a  VTC 
team member could closely monitor the drug use by conducting random pill counts.    

elationship Between The Military Service, The Mental Health And/Or Substance Abuse Issues, 
And The Commission Of The Offense(s) 

he  VTC  team  also  should  determine  what,  if  any,  causal  connection  must  be  established 
between  the  offender’s  military  service  and  the  alleged  mental  health  or  substance  abuse  issue

  F

and/or  between  the  alleged  mental  health  or  substance  abuse  issue  and  the  commission  of  the 
charged  offense(s).    Some  courts  may  conclude  that  these  are  significant  considerations  while 
others may conclude that a causal connection is not required.     
 

Combat Veterans 

ourts must decide whether eligibility for participation in a VTC will be limited by the nature of 
the offender’s military service.  As with other eligibility factors, courts may wish to evaluate this 
issue  on  a  case-by-case  basis  or  set  initial  parameters  and  reevaluate  those  parameters  as 
necessary over time. 

n  the  past,  a  service  member’s  military  occupational  specialty  (“MOS”)  clearly  defined  the 
service member’s role.  In the current military operations, a clearly-defined “front line” does not 
exist, and individuals who are serving in non-combat roles routinely find themselves involved in 
potentially life-threatening situations or exposed to emotionally-disturbing scenes.  For example, 
someone who is serving in an administrative capacity on a military base in a combat theater will 
be subjected to the same mortar fire as everyone else who resides on that base.  A person who 
has  a  non-combat  MOS  would  be  exposed  to  IEDs  when  being  transported  in  a  convoy,  and 
could be exposed to dead bodies, body parts, and great destruction on or off the base.  Moreover, 
someone who has a non-combat MOS may be required to perform combat-related duties.      

ental health issues and substance abuse issues also are suffered by service members who never 
serve in a combat theater.  For example, MSTs often occur outside of a combat theater, and TBIs 
can be caused by incidents which occur during training exercises.  Similarly, a service member 
who is serving as part of peacekeeping mission may witness atrocities but be powerless to help 
due  to  the  limited  peacekeeping  role.    Finally,  service  members  who  serve  during  natural 
disasters will be exposed to death and destruction.  

f a court wishes to limit participation to “combat veterans,” the court should clearly define the 
parameters.  For example, would anyone who served in a combat theater be eligible, would the 
person  be  required  to  have  a  combat-related  MOS,  or  would  the  person  have  to  prove  that  he 
actually engaged in combat?   
 

Screenings 

ven if a county identifies an offender as a veteran or service member, the offender should not 
automatically be considered for participation in a VTC.  For a VTC to be effective, participation 
must be voluntary.  Therefore, the AOC recommends that a VTC require an offender to submit 
an  application  if  he  is  interested  in  participating  in  a  VTC.    The  AOC  possesses  sample 
applications, which it will forward to interested judges upon request.  

fter an offender submits an application, the offender must be subjected to both a screening and 
an assessment.  A screening is distinguishable from an assessment in that the former determines 
eligibility and appropriateness for participation, while the latter identifies the nature and scope of 
the needed treatment and services.  After a court determines the eligibility requirements for the 
VTC, it will be necessary for potential participants to go through a legal screening to determine 

  C

  I

  M

  I

  E

  A

30 
 

legal  eligibility,  including  the  consideration  of  the  risk  to  public  safety  and  the  offender’s 
willingness  to  comply  with  the  VTC’s  requirements.    Potential  participants  also  should  be 
required  to  undergo  a  clinical  screening  to  determine,  among  other  things,  whether  treatment 
would  be  appropriate/necessary  as  well  as  whether  the  person  is  willing  to  submit  to  any 
necessary treatment.   

t is important to remember that the initial clinical screening is very limited in scope and does not 
result  in  a  diagnosis.      Therefore,  although  these  initial  screenings  are  helpful  and  serve  their 
limited purposes, the person must undergo a clinical assessment before being treated.  A clinical 
assessment  results  in  a  diagnosis  as  well  as  the  formulation  of  an  appropriate  treatment  plan.   
Individuals  who  participate  in  problem-solving  courts  typically  will  undergo  multiple 
assessments so their treatment plans can be adjusted as their needs change over time.   

ow  quickly  the  initial  screening  and  assessment  can  be  completed  and  who  will  perform  the 
screening/assessment  will  depend  upon  such  things  as  the  eligible  population  for  the  court  at 
issue (VA eligible only, anyone who has served, service members, etc.), the caseload/schedule of 
the court personnel, the caseload/location of the mental health/drug/VA facility, the availability 
of  necessary  transportation,  whether  the  VTC  is  a  pre-adjudication  or  post-adjudication  court, 
whether  the  offender  is  incarcerated  or  has  been  released  on  bond,  and  whether  the  issue  is  a 
substance  abuse  issue,  a  mental  health  issue,  or  both.    Every  county  functions  somewhat 
differently,  so  the  AOC  does  not  recommend  a  statewide,  uniform  procedure  for  these 
screenings/assessments. 

n some VTCs, the court coordinator initially gathers as much information as possible from the 
potential  participant,  the  potential  participant’s  family,  the  court’s  files  (including  information 
regarding  the  alleged  offense(s)  and  any  previous  offenses),  and  any  available  medical  or 
military  records.    The  coordinator  then  provides  the  prosecutor  with  this  information,  and  the 
prosecutor  reviews  the  information,  consults  with  the  victim,  and  makes  a  determination 
regarding whether the offender should automatically be excluded from participation.  Assuming 
the prosecutor does not automatically exclude the offender, the offender then undergoes a formal 
assessment,  after  which  the  entire  VTC  team  determines  whether  the  offender  should  be 
permitted to participate in the VTC.  The gatekeeper function performed by the prosecutor in this 
scenario  is  important  due  to  courts’  limited  resources.    In  other  words,  if  the  prosecutor 
determines that the offender is not an appropriate candidate for VTC participation, subjecting the 
offender to a formal clinical assessment would be an unnecessary expenditure.  This is just one 
example of a procedure utilized by a VTC.  A Tennessee court may determine that an entirely 
different procedure is appropriate for its VTC program.     

f the offender at issue is eligible for medical benefits through the VA, the VA must conduct the 
required  clinical  screening  and  assessment.4
    The  VA  will  only  provide  treatment  that  its 
employees  determine  is  medically  necessary.    The  time  it  takes  to  complete  this  process  will 
depend  upon  the  court’s  proximity  to  the  VA’s  clinics  and  medical  centers  as  well  as  the 
available resources at those facilities.

Privacy/Confidentiality/Constitutional Issues 
 
Prior to creating a VTC, a court should consider entering into a memorandum of understanding 
(“MOU”) with the VA and any other entity with which the VTC will frequently be interacting.  
This  will  eliminate  the  potential  for  confusion  regarding  their  respective  responsibilities  and 
expectations.  The AOC possesses sample MOUs, which are available upon request, and MOUs 
also  can  be  found  on  numerous  websites  cited  in  this  report,  including  www.NDCRC.org.  
MOUs, while helpful, do not resolve the confidentiality and privacy issues.   

lthough courts are not covered entities for the purpose of the privacy provisions of the Health 
Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (“HIPAA”)  unless  the  courts  are  the  actual 
treatment  providers,  problem-solving  courts  are  provided  with  treatment  information  from 
covered entities and, therefore, should make every effort to comply with HIPAA.  For additional 
information  regarding  that  issue,  judges  who  are  considering  creating  a  problem-solving  court 
may wish to consult with a judge who currently is presiding over such a court.  Judges also may

n  addition  to  privacy  considerations  regarding  records  created  by  a  court,  courts  also  must 
address  confidentiality  issues  regarding  records  it  wishes  to  obtain.    Much  of  the  information 
required by a VTC to adequately address an offender’s mental health and substance abuse issues 
is confidential, and VTCs will not be provided with access absent a waiver by the offender.  For 
example, if  a  VTC wishes to obtain  a  copy  of the veteran’s medical records from  the  VA, the 
veteran  must  complete  and  submit  VA  Form  10-5345  (Request  For  And  Authorization  To 
Release  Medical  Records  or  Health  Information),  which  can  be  found  on  the  VA’s  website  at 
http://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-5345-fill.pdf.    If  necessary,  a  veteran  also  can 
authorize a VTC’s treatment provider (if it is a non-VA provider) to release information to the 
VA.    To  do  this,  the  veteran  must  complete  VA  Form  21-4142,  which  can  be  found  at 
http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-4142-ARE.pdf.    If  a  veteran  has  not  applied  for 
benefits  through  the  VA,  the  VA’s  records  will  be  very  limited  and  it  may  be  necessary  to 
request records from the Department of Defense. 

TCs  also  may  need  to  obtain  access  to  the  VA’s  records  regarding  a  VTC  participant’s 
financial benefits.  VTCs often provide veterans and service members with guidance regarding 
the proper way to manage their financial assets.  Many veterans are not skilled at budgeting and, 
as a result, will have difficulty becoming productive members of society after graduating from a 
VTC  even  if  the  VTC  resolves  their  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  issues.    This  is 
particularly true for drug abusers, who routinely spend any available funds on drugs.

Veterans who participate in a VTC may apply for disability compensation benefits through the 
Veterans Benefits Administration (“VBA”) after being informed of this available benefit.  If the 
veteran  qualifies  and  is  approved,  the  veteran  will  begin  receiving  monthly  checks  from  the 
VBA.  Eligible veterans also will receive back pay for the period of time during which they were 
eligible  for,  but  did  not  receive,  disability  compensation.    For  example,  a  VTC  staff  member 
informed the AOC that one of its participants received $30,000 in back pay.   

umerous  VTCs  emphasized  to  the  AOC  that  it  is  crucial  for  a  VTC  to  have  access  to 
information regarding any income a VTC participant is receiving from the VBA.  In addition to 
monitoring a veteran's expenditures and educating the veteran regarding the appropriate way to 
budget,  a  VTC  team  needs  to  be  aware  that  someone  who  is  inclined  to  “blow”  an  entire 
paycheck on drugs over a weekend is now receiving a substantial amount of income.  The VA 
does  not  have  a  form  which  is  designed  to  give  courts  or  other  interested  persons  access  to 
information  regarding  monetary  benefits  a  veteran  is  receiving  from  the  VBA.   However,  the 
VBA  will  provide  this  information  to  a  court upon  receipt  of  a  court  order  accompanied  by  a 
waiver or consent form which has been signed by the veteran at issue.    

here  are  numerous  other  ethical,  confidentiality,  legal  and  constitutional  issues  related  to 
problem-solving courts.  For additional information and forms regarding these issues, courts may 
wish to consult Chapters 8-10 of The Drug Court Judicial Benchbook.  This benchbook can be

Mentors  

s with the other issues which are  addressed in this report, there are differing views regarding 
some aspects of the mentoring issue.  Based upon the AOC’s research, training, and interviews, 
though, there  appears to  be universal agreement  that  mentors  are an  important component of a 
VTC  or  veterans  court  docket.    Each  court  should  determine  what  procedures  are  most 
appropriate  for  the  county  or  judicial  district  in  which  the  court  is  located.    However,  the 
information below may be helpful in identifying and resolving the pertinent issues. 

ole of the Mentor 

s  a  general  rule,  a  mentor  does  not  give  legal  advice,  does  not  serve  on  the  VTC  team,  and 
should refrain from criticizing the court or the court’s staff when speaking with a defendant.  If a 

  N

  T

  S

  A

  R

  A

33 
 

defendant  is  unhappy  with  an  aspect  of  his  treatment  or  the  legal  issues  associated  with  the 
criminal proceedings, the mentor should refer the defendant to a member of the VTC team. 

  mentor’s  primary  role  is  to  serve  as  a  resource  and  to  provide  emotional  support  and 
encouragement.    The  majority  of  people  who  have  served  in  the  military  have  a  “warrior 
mentality” and, as one VTC staff member stated, feel as if they should be “lean, mean fighting 
machines”  who  do  not  need  help  from  anyone  for  any  reason.    If  they  have  mental  health  or 
substance  abuse  issues  during  or  after  their  service,  they  do  not  want  to  admit  that  they  need 
help.    This  can  be  for  one  of  the  following  reasons  or  for  an  unrelated  reason:    (1)  There  is  a 
stigma  attached  to  admitting  you  have  a  problem  and  seeking  help;  (2)  They  fear  that  their 
military careers will suffer if they admit to having mental health or substance abuse issues; (3) 
They  have  survivor  guilt  and  think  they  should  not  be  complaining  about  “minor”  mental 
health/substance abuse  issues when others have  died and/or they think they  don’t  deserve help 
because they deserve to be punished for failing to do more to help someone who died; (4) They 
assume  that  everyone  who  served  feels  the  same  way  and  that  it’s  just  a  “normal”  reaction  to 
what  they  went  through;  and  (5)  They  think  they’re  strong  enough  to  help  themselves.    The 
mentor’s role is to counter the warrior mentality and to convince the defendant that it is okay to 
seek and receive help.  It is important to remember, though, that the mentor is not a counselor.  
The treatment professional, not the mentor, should provide any necessary counseling and related 
treatment.   

n addition to providing emotional support, a mentor can assist a defendant with issues which are 
unrelated to the disposition  of the  criminal charges.   One  VTC graduate  explained that he was 
completely  overwhelmed  by  the  paperwork  and  bureaucracy  associated  with  seeking  VA 
benefits.  While having a defendant perform some tasks on his own will give him confidence and 
help with his recovery, mentors can provide some assistance, particularly for defendants who are 
in the very early stages of the VTC program and are easily overwhelmed.   

efendants often will share problems (such as not having enough money to buy a bus pass to get 
to court or to a treatment appointment) with mentors that they are too embarrassed to share with 
the  judge  during  a  court  proceeding.    Some  mentor  programs  raise  funds  so  they  can  provide 
defendants with such  things as bus passes, eye  glasses,  furniture,  funds  for electric bills or car 
payments,  etc.    One  VTC  mentioned  a  defendant  who  desperately  needed  employment  and 
housing.  Unbeknownst to the defendant, one mentor owned an apartment complex and another 
mentor owned a company, so the mentors were able to provide both employment and housing.  
As  noted  above,  mentors  also  assist  defendants  in  accessing  veterans’  benefits  and  any  other 
benefits to which they are entitled and which will assist them in their recovery.

ith  regard  to  other  types  of  assistance  which  can  be  provided  by  mentors,  one  VTC  judge 
explained  that  a  defendant  was  behaving  in  an  immature  fashion,  showing  up  late  for  court 
hearings, and otherwise failing to comply with the VTC requirements.  A mentor addressed these 
issues with the  defendant,  explaining  how important it was for him  to comply  with  the court’s 
requirements  and  how  everyone  on  the  VTC  team  was  trying  to  help  him.    The  mentor  also 
taught the defendant how to use the day planner the court had given him.  The judge said there 
was a significant change in the defendant’s attitude following the mentor’s intervention. 
 

34 
 

A VTC also must address confidentiality issues as they relate to mentors.  The VTC must decide 
whether, and under what circumstances,  a  mentor will tell the judge  or another member of the 
VTC team something that the defendant told the mentor.  Some courts feel strongly that a mentor 
is  not  part  of  the  VTC  team,  is  not  a  probation  officer,  and  should  not  repeat  anything  the 
defendant  says  unless  there  are  extenuating  circumstances  such  as  a  mentor’s  belief  that  the 
defendant  intends  to  harm  himself  or  someone  else.    However,  a  member  of  one  court’s  team 
expressed  her  view  that  defendants  are  more  honest  with  mentors  than  with  VTC  staff,  that 
mentors  “listen  with  a  different  ear”  than  other  VTC  staff  members,  and  that  the  defendant’s 
recovery will be more successful if a mentor shares relevant information with the team.  Courts 
may  find,  however,  that  a  volunteer  mentor  will  object  to  being  required  to  share  information 
with the VTC team since a mentor’s goal is to help the defendant as opposed to behaving like a 
probation  officer  or  another  member  of  the  VTC  team.    Regardless  of  which  theory  a  court 
adopts, it is extremely important for the VTC to confirm that a defendant clearly understands a 
mentor’s  role,  including  whether  statements  made  to  a  mentor  are  confidential  or  could  be 
repeated to the VTC team.  

he  level  of  a  mentor’s  involvement  with  a  defendant  might  vary  depending  upon  the  VTC 
phase.  For example, a defendant who is in the first phase of the program may not be emotionally 
ready to speak to  a mentor, and a defendant who is  in  the final phase  of the program may not 
need as much support from a mentor.  In contrast, a defendant who is in one of the middle phases 
of the program may require considerable assistance and emotional support.   

imilarly, defendants who have mental health issues may be interested in talking with a mentor 
on some days but not on others.  It is important for the mentor coordinator, the VTC team, and 
other court personnel to receive training from a mental health professional regarding how to deal 
with persons  who have  mental health issues.  For  example,  individuals who suffer from PTSD 
often do not like being approached from behind.  Therefore, if a veteran who is suffering from 
PTSD is being taken into custody for a VTC violation, the judge should warn the veteran that an 
officer is going to handcuff him, and the officer  should consider  approaching the veteran from 
the front instead of approaching him from behind.  Similarly, if a veteran who is suffering from 
PTSD in uncomfortable in crowds and/or in dark places, giving the veteran a gift card to a movie 
theater would not be the most appropriate manner of rewarding the veteran for meeting a VTC 
goal.   

hether a defendant is assigned to one mentor or rotates among multiple mentors may depend 
upon the number of available mentors.  It also may depend upon the particular VTC’s philosophy 
or  a  mental  health  expert’s  advice.    Some  courts  believe  that  the  veteran  should  always  be 
assigned  to  the  same  mentor  so  the  veteran  does  not  have  to  explain  his  history  and  issues  to 
multiple people.  In contrast, some courts believe that it is helpful for a veteran to be exposed to 
multiple  mentors  since  each  mentor  has  something  different  to  offer.    If  a  mentor  coordinator 
rotates the mentors due to the VTC’s philosophy or because the VTC does not have an adequate 
number  of  mentors,  it  would  be  helpful  to  have  a  book  in  which  each  mentor  makes  notes 
regarding  his  conversation  with  a  defendant  so  the  next  mentor  will  have  access  to  that 
information.    Moreover,  even  if  a  court  chooses  to  rotate  the  mentors,  the  mentor  coordinator 
may wish to assign a single mentor to a defendant who is having particular difficulty adjusting to 
treatment or to the VTC requirements.

ith  a  defendant’s  permission,  mentors  should  consider  talking  with  the  defendant’s  family 
members in addition to talking with the defendant.  Mentors learn things from family members 
that they do not learn from defendants since the families have a different perspective.  Mentors 
also can assist family members who are entitled to benefits through the VA or other agencies.  

ow  often  a  mentor  communicates  with  a  defendant  likely  will  vary  depending  upon  each 
defendant’s  circumstances.    In  some  courts,  the  mentor  speaks  with  the  defendant  for  15-20 
minutes after each court session, calls the defendant once per week to confirm that the defendant 
is doing well and to encourage the defendant, and calls to remind the defendant about court dates 
and other required appointments.  

electing Mentors 

he  mentor  coordinator  is  responsible  for  selecting  mentors,  and  the  coordinator  may  wish  to 
have  mentor  candidates  observe  court  proceedings  and/or  talk  with  current  mentors  prior  to 
commencing the application process.  The coordinator should be a veteran who is familiar with 
the  VA,  the  community  (including  available  services  and  resources),  and  the  court  system.  
Although the mentor  coordinator’s position  could  be a  paid  position if  resources are  available, 
mentors should be volunteers.  Moreover, defendants will have the most productive relationships 
with mentors who have the most in common with them, so it is important to have a diverse pool 
of mentors.   

he  most  important  requirement  for  a  mentor,  including  the  mentor  coordinator,  is  that  the 
person has previously served, or is currently serving, in the military.  The following categories, 
among  others,  should  be  considered  when  selecting  mentors  and/or  when  determining  which 
mentor(s)  should  be  assigned  to  each  defendant:    (1)  branch  of  service;  (2)  type  of  service 
(combat  experience  vs.  non-combat  experience,  National  Guard  vs.  active  duty,  occupational 
specialty (tank driver vs. sniper), etc.); (3) personal interests; (4) family history; (5) gender; (6) 
age;  (7)  ethnicity;  and  (8)  mentor  candidate’s  familiarity  with  issues  which  will  be  helpful  in 
assisting  defendants  (mental  health,  employment,  transportation,  veterans’  benefits,  education, 
etc.).    It  is  not  mandatory  for  the  defendant  and  the  mentor  to  be  the  same  gender,  but  the 
defendant  may  be  more  comfortable  with  a  mentor  of  the  same  gender  if,  for  example,  the 
defendant  is  a  victim  of  MST  and  the  perpetrator  was  a  member  of  the  opposite  gender.    It  is 
very important to pair persons who served in the same branch of the military if at all possible.   

he AOC is not endorsing any of the listed groups, but VTC staff members, conference speakers, 
and other individuals who are involved with VTCs informed the AOC that the following groups 
often are consulted when a court is attempting to recruit mentors:  Women Veterans of America, 
Marine  Corps  League,  National  Association  for  Black  Veterans,  Operation  Stand  Down, 
Veterans  of  Foreign  Wars,  Military  Order  of  the  Purple  Heart,  American  Red  Cross,  The 
American  Legion,  Disabled  American  Veterans,  Vietnam  Veterans  of  America,  Paralyzed 
Veterans of America, Elk Lodge, Blue Star Mothers of America, Inc., Wounded Warrior Project, 
The  National  Exchange  Club,  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  Veterans  of  America,  Hope  For  Heroes 
Foundation, The Salvation Army, Volunteers of America, AMVETS, Narcotics Anonymous, and

Alcoholics  Anonymous.    Courts  also  send  representatives  to  special  events  such  as  a  Marine 
Corps birthday party in an effort to recruit veterans to serve as mentors.   

n  addition  to  contacting  these  types  of  service  organizations,  courts  should  recruit  local,  state 
and federal  employees or  retirees  who are  veterans and who  are  familiar  with  programs which 
could benefit veterans.  This could include, but would not be limited to, county veterans service 
officers  as  well  as  employees/retirees  who  work(ed)/volunteer(ed)  for  the  VA,  TDVA,  United 
States  Department  of  Labor,  Tennessee  Department  of  Labor  and  Workforce  Development, 
Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, Tennessee Department 
of Human Services, Tennessee Military Department, law enforcement agencies, and Vet Centers 
(often trained in PTSD/TBI issues).  Courts also  could  recruit  mentors  from  the private sector, 
particularly if the candidates have access to housing or employment opportunities for defendants 
or if they are teachers, social workers, or  attorneys (not an attorney who  is associated with the 
VTC).  

entors  who  are  retired  are  often  available  to  attend  every  VTC  docket.    In  contrast,  younger 
mentors and/or mentors who are in the National Guard or the Reserves are often juggling family, 
school,  and  employment  responsibilities,  so  their  schedules  may  not  be  as  flexible.    The  latter 
may  wish  to  consult  with  their  employers  and  explain  the  services  they  are  providing.    The 
employer – particularly if the employer is a state or federal agency – may be willing to assist the 
employee  by  allowing  him  to  participate  in  VTC  proceedings  without  being  required  to  take 
annual leave or a reduction in pay for the time the employee is out of the office.  It is important 
to pair defendants with mentors who are in similar age groups, though, so it is better to include 
some part-time, young mentors than to exclude them completely simply because they anticipate 
missing some court dates.        

ourts  also  should  consider  whether  a  mentor  candidate  should  be  excluded  because  he  has  a 
criminal  record,  is  a  recovering  drug  addict  or  alcoholic,  or  received  something  other  than  an 
honorable discharge. Many courts require background checks for mentor candidates but consider 
the criminal record/recovery/discharge issues on a case-by-case basis.   

n occasion, a VTC graduate will request to become a VTC mentor.  According to a VTC staff 
member,  a  VA  counselor  recommended  that  courts  wait  eight  months  after  the  graduation  to 
confirm  that  the  graduate  is  stable.    As  discussed  elsewhere  in  this  report,  transition  periods, 
including graduation from the program, are high-risk periods for persons who have drug/mental 
health issues and can result in relapses. 

egardless of the nature of the screening process, the mentor coordinator should learn as much 
as  possible  about  the  mentor  candidate  and  should  continue  to  monitor  the  mentor’s  behavior 
once the mentor is selected to participate in the VTC.  As one coordinator stated, not all veterans 
are  good  people  and  even  if  they  were,  not  all  good  people  are  good  mentors.    Coordinators 
should not be afraid to reject applicants or to fire mentors whose behavior is inappropriate.  For 
example, if a mentor is telling the defendant  to  “stand  up and be  a  man”  instead of relying on 
professional  mental  health  and/or  substance  abuse  treatment,  that  mentor  should  be  removed 
from the program or be subjected to additional training.

Training Mentors 

he  nature  of  mentor  training  will  depend  upon  the  scope  of  the  mentors’  responsibilities  as 
determined by the  court and mentor coordinator,  but mentors should become familiar with VA 
benefits,  other  available  resources  for  veterans  and  service  members,  and  the  court  system.  
Mentors also should be trained on the appropriate manner in which to communicate with persons 
who  suffer  from  mental  health  and/or  substance  abuse  issues.    Regardless  of  the  nature  of  the 
initial  training,  the  mentor  coordinator  may  wish  to  meet  with  the  mentors  periodically  and/or 
provide additional training/presentations as needed.  The mentor coordinator also should provide 
mentors with a list of resources and contact numbers/names for pertinent agencies.

udge  Russell’s  (founder  of  VTCs)  VTC  is  in  the  process  of  revising  the  policy/procedure 
manual for its mentors and has kindly agreed to share it.  When it becomes available, the AOC 
will distribute it to anyone who requests a copy.  The AOC has a copy of the current version of 
the manual and related materials, and the AOC will forward those upon request.

National Drug Court Resource Center at www.ndcrc.org/node/182.  
 

Transportation 

ndividuals  who  have  mental  health  and/or  substance  abuse  issues  often  have  difficulties  with 
finances and interpersonal relationships.  One of the byproducts of this is that these individuals 
have limited access to transportation because they cannot afford to own a vehicle and they have 
few,  if  any,  family  members  or  friends  who  are  willing  to  provide  transportation.  Because 
problem-solving  court  participants  must  attend  court  hearings,  supervision  meetings,  and 
treatment  appointments  on  a  regular  basis,  limited  access  to  transportation  is  a  significant 
obstacle  to  participating  in  such  a  court.    For  this  reason,  some  problem-solving  courts  limit 
eligibility  to  persons  who  can  establish  that  they  have  access  to  transportation.    Although  the 
AOC  anticipated  that  the  lack  of  transportation  would  cause  a  significant  problem  for  VTC 
participants,  the  AOC  has  discovered  some  programs  which  will  assist  VTC  participants  with 
that issue. 

he  Tennessee  Department  of  Transportation  (“TDOT”)  receives  funding  from  the  Federal 
Transit  Administration  to  provide  statewide  public  transportation  for  individuals  in  all  95 
counties.    Federal  Transit  Administration  grant  funds  are  allocated  to  twenty-eight  (28)  transit 
providers  across  the  state.    TDOT  provided  the  AOC  with  a  list  of  its  representative  for  each 
county,  and  the  AOC  will  provide  courts  with  a  copy  of  this  list  upon  request.    The  three 
programs  which  are  available  to  assist  qualified  individuals,  including  veterans  and  service 
members, are the Job Access  and Reverse Commute Program, the New  Freedom Program  and 
general public transportation services.  

he  Job  Access  and  Reverse  Commute  Program,  which  is  administered  by  TDOT  grantees, 
provides employment-related transportation.  Specifically, transit is offered for submitting a job

application,  participating  in  a  job  interview,  or  traveling  to  work  after  obtaining  employment.   
The program is available in the rural areas at no cost if the individual certifies that his income 
does not exceed the Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines, or if the participant receives 
a  referral  from  a  county  office  of  the  Tennessee  Department  of  Human  Services.    In  the  
“urbanized  areas”  (Knoxville,  Chattanooga,  Memphis,  Nashville,  Clarksville,  Cleveland, 
Jackson,  and  Johnson  City),  Job  Access  funding  is  used  to  provide  extended  hours  or  special 
routes, but passengers must pay public transit fares.  

or  individuals  who  have  qualified  disabilities,  TDOT  grantees  participating  in  the  New 
Freedom Program may provide no-cost transportation to employment-related activities as well as 
travel training for individuals who require assistance utilizing public transportation.  

inally, public transit agencies operating in  rural areas offer “demand response”  service which 
provides door-to-door transportation.  Rural public transportation is open to the general public, 
and  passengers  must  pay  a  fare.    Rural  public  transportation  operators  cross  county  lines  and 
frequently  travel  to  large  urbanized  areas.    This  includes  transport  to  VA  medical  centers  and 
clinics.  As a general rule, individuals must call the rural transit agency 24 to 48 hours in advance 
to make a reservation and also must provide detailed trip information.  The one exception is that 
TDOT  has  a  contract  with  the  Tennessee  Department  of  Correction  (“TDOC”)  to  transport 
persons who are on state probation or parole (these individuals were supervised by the Board of 
Probation  and  Parole  prior  to  the  BOPP/TDOC  merger).5
    TDOT’s  demand  response  service 
works  with  TDOC  to  provide  guaranteed  reservations  for  individuals  who  are  referred  for 
transport to treatment appointments or to employment interviews.  TDOT also provides TDOC 
with a detailed accounting of the trip, including mileage, what time the individual was picked up 
and dropped off, and whether the individual requested any additional stops.  This information is 
useful  for  the  purpose  of  confirming  that  the  individual  complied  with  employment/treatment 
requirements, that the individual did so in a timely fashion, and that the trip did not include any 
additional/unapproved stops.       
 
If a veteran travels to a VA medical center or clinic, the VA will provide mileage reimbursement 
under certain circumstances.  For more information regarding eligibility for reimbursement, see 
http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/resources/BeneTravelFAQ.asp.    Even  if  a  veteran  is  eligible 
for travel reimbursement, there are very specific  rules regarding the parameters.    For  example, 
the  veteran  must  travel  to  the  closest  VA  facility  which  is  capable  of  providing  the  necessary 
care.  In other words, the VA will not reimburse a veteran who travels to a VA medical center if 
the veteran lives near a VA clinic which is capable of providing the care.  Also, absent a waiver, 
veterans are required to pay a deductible for each trip.   The AOC possesses an electronic version 
of  the  VA’s  travel  benefits  summary,  and  the  AOC  will  forward  it  to  interested  persons  upon 
request. 

ometimes it will be necessary for  a veteran to  be seen by a doctor  at a VA medical center as 
opposed  to  the  local  VA  clinic.    Veterans  service  organizations  such  as  Disabled  American 
Veterans often work with the VA to provide round-trip transportation from a VA clinic to a VA 

                                                 
5 The funding for the TDOC/TDOT contract is a grant which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2013, and TDOC is 
unsure  whether  additional  funding  will  be  available  after  that  date.    Therefore,  although  the  rural  areas’  demand 
response service will continue after June 30, the TDOC/TDOT agreement may not continue after that date.

medical center.  Courts should contact their local VA clinics for additional information regarding 
schedules and availability.  The AOC  also encourages  courts to contact local Vet Centers.  On 
occasion, Vet Center representatives will travel to a courthouse to provide limited mental health 
treatment for eligible veterans who are unable to travel to the Vet Center.  Vet Center treatment 
eligibility is discussed elsewhere in this report. 
  

Defense Counsel 

n some VTCs, the attorney who is initially appointed to represent the defendant continues that 
representation while the defendant participates in the VTC.  In other VTCs, defense attorneys are 
permanently  assigned  to  the  VTC,  and  those  attorneys  represent  all  participants.    Defense 
attorneys who are interested in participating in a VTC or other problem-solving court may wish 
to  refer  to  NDCI’s  publication  entitled  Critical  Issues  for  Defense  Attorneys  in  Drug  Court  at 
http://www.ndci.org/sites/default/files/ndci/Mono4.CriticalIssues.pdf.  
 

Program Evaluations 

  VTC  should  have  a  mission  statement  as  well  as  goals  and  objectives.    The  court  will  be 
unable  to  determine  if  it  is  achieving  its  goals  and  objectives  unless  the  court  gathers  and 
analyzes data.  This is important for the purpose of determining such things as whether the court 
is reaching its intended population and whether  the program’s  graduates have  avoided relapses 
and/or subsequent arrests.  If a VTC does not determine what is working and what is not working 
in  its  program,  the  VTC  is  destined  to  repeat  its  mistakes  and  will  not  be  successful.    Equally 
important is the fact that possessing this data will permit the court to provide potential funding 
sources and members of the local community with adequate data to support a request for funding 
or other types of support.  It will be necessary for the court to possess a computer information 
system  which  is  adequate  for  these  purposes,  and  the  court  will  need  adequate  staff  to  collect, 
record, and analyze the data.   

ue  to  the  confidentiality  of  the  collected  information,  the  court’s  computer  system  must  be  a 
secure  system.    The  Tennessee  Department  of  Mental  Health  and  Substance  Abuse  Services 
(“DMH”)  currently  utilizes  the  Tennessee  Web  Based  Information  Technology  System  (“TN-
WITS”), which is a secure system Tennessee’s drug treatment courts will begin utilizing in early 
2013  due  to  the  recent  transfer  of  drug  court  supervision  responsibilities  from  the  Office  of 
Criminal  Justice  Programs  to  DMH.    VTCs  are  not  included  in  DMH’s  supervision 
responsibilities  at  this  time,  but  opportunities  may  arise  in  the  future  for  the  VTCs  to  work  in 
collaboration with DMH and access the TN-WITS system. 

lthough  various  organizations  are  attempting  to  develop  a  nationwide  standard  for  VTC  data 
collection,  this  standard  does  not  yet  exist.    Dr.  Cary  Heck,  Associate  Professor  in  the 
Department of Criminal Justice at the University of Wyoming, made a presentation at one of the 
national VTC trainings attended by the AOC, and Dr. Heck provided the AOC with a list of the 
types of data VTCs may wish to collect for program evaluation purposes.  There are numerous 
listed items, but the list includes military categories such as branch of service, years of service, 
and rank, and non-military categories related to substance abuse and mental health issues.  The 
AOC will forward this list to interested persons upon request.

he AOC possesses additional information regarding evaluation issues, and this information will 
be  made  available  to  courts  upon  request.    Courts  also  may  wish  to  consult  with  judges  who 
currently preside over problem-solving courts and refer to The Drug Court Judicial Benchbook, 
which  is  available  online  at  http://www.ndci.org/publications/more-publications/-drug-court-
judicial-benchbook.  
 

Costs 

hen deciding whether to create a VTC, a judge must consider the costs associated with such a 
court as well as the available resources and funding opportunities.  Those issues are discussed in 
more detail elsewhere in this report.    
 

Regional Courts 

udicial districts which have an interest in creating a VTC or veterans docket but do not have an 
adequate  number  of  veterans  or  sufficient  resources  to  do  so  may  wish  to  work  with  other 
judicial  districts  to  create  a  regional  court.    Due  to  the  many  logistical  and  jurisdictional 
challenges  associated  with  such  a  court,  the  legislature  should  not  mandate  regional  courts, 
however.   

  regional  court  may  be  an  attractive  option  for  rural  areas.    Many  service  members/veterans 
reside  in  rural  areas,  and  there  are  few  resources  available  when  service  members  return 
following their service.  The problem, however, is that VA resources may be equally unavailable 
in those areas. 

he  AOC  attended  a  presentation  regarding  regional  courts  which  are  currently  functioning  in 
Oregon  and  Missouri,  and  the  AOC  will  discuss  the  presentation  with  Tennessee  judges  upon 
request.  The AOC also possesses contact information for those courts, and the AOC will provide 
this  information  to  Tennessee  judges  who  are  interested  in  speaking  with  the  courts’ 
coordinators. 

COMMUNITY SUPERVISION 

lose  supervision  of  a  VTC  participant  is  important  both  inside  and  outside  the  courtroom.   
When  the  offender’s  behavior  is  being  monitored  outside  the  courtroom  to  ensure  compliance 
with the program’s requirements, this is referred to as community supervision.  As part of this 
supervision,  the  court  may  wish  to  require  the  offender  to  agree  to  both  announced  and 
unannounced  visits  to  such  places  as  his  home,  bars  he  frequented  prior  to  his  arrest,  and  his 
place of employment.   

ach VTC team will be required to determine who is responsible for performing this task.  For 
example, a probation officer’s supervisor may not permit the officer to conduct home visits, or a 
probation  officer  may  not  have  been  assigned  to  the  team  or  to  the  offender.    In  those 
circumstances, it might be more appropriate for a law enforcement officer or the case manager to 

  T

  W

  J

  A

  T

   

  C

  E

41 
 

perform  this  task.    To  allow  for  more  random  visits  during  the  day  and  at  night,  it  would  be 
beneficial to have more than one person (ideally, persons who work different shifts) serve in this 
capacity.   

nyone  who  is  responsible  for  community  supervision  of  VTC  participants  should  be  trained 
and should be a member of the VTC team.  While inappropriate behavior by the offender should 
be reported to the team and it is important for the team to have an accurate understanding of the 
offender’s  compliance,  or  lack  thereof,  with  the  program’s  conditions,  the  person  who  is 
conducting  the  random  visits  should  not  proceed  as  if  the  goal  is  to  catch  the  offender  doing 
something  wrong.    Moreover,  the  training  should  include  guidance  regarding  the  appropriate 
manner in which to deal with offenders who have mental health and/or substance abuse issues.  
For  example,  if  an  offender  suffers  from  PTSD,  there  could  be  serious  ramifications  if  a  law 
enforcement officer has his hand on his gun when he enters the offender’s home.   

  person  who  makes  home  visits  also  should  consider  an  offender’s  individual  circumstances 
when determining the proper time and manner to perform those visits.  For example, an offender 
who is suffering from  PTSD would  have an  adverse reaction  if  someone banged  loudly  on his 
door  in  the  middle  of  the  night.    If  that  offender  reports  that  he  has  difficulty  sleeping  and  is 
often  awake  during  certain  specified  hours  of  the  night,  some  of  the  unannounced  overnight 
visits could take place during that time period but on unannounced days.     

he visits should be conducted randomly as opposed to occurring on a particular day of the week 
at a particular time (or only during office hours).  If the visits are not random, it will be difficult 
to capture an accurate picture of the offender’s behavior because the offender will prepare for the 
visit and portray himself in the best light by refraining from consuming prohibited substances or 
by altering his behavior in some other manner.   

inally,  these  random  visits  will  be  an  important  tool  in  a  court’s  attempt  to  address  an 
offender’s  denial  regarding  his  substance  abuse.    As  previously  noted,  it  is  often  difficult  for 
substance  abusers  to  recognize  that  they  have  a  substance  abuse  issue  and  to  accept  that  they 
need treatment for it.  Conducting random drug screens will assist a court in demonstrating that 
an  offender  does  in  fact  have  a  substance  abuse  issue.    However,  those  screens  will  not  be  an 
effective  tool  if  an  offender  finds  a  way  to  circumvent  them  or  if  the  offender  is  abusing  a 
substance which is not detected by the type of screen which is utilized by the court.  In contrast, 
if  a  VTC  participant  continues  to  abuse  substances,  community  supervision  likely  will  expose 
that behavior.  When the court confronts the participant following a random visit which exposes 
continued  substance  abuse,  it  will  be  more  difficult  for  the  participant  to  deny  that  he  has  a 
problem and to deny that he needs treatment.  

SANCTIONS AND INCENTIVES 

  court’s  response  to  an  offender’s  behavior  is  an  important  aspect  of  a  treatment  court.   

Inappropriate  behavior  should  be  discouraged  through  the  use  of  sanctions,  and  appropriate 
behavior should be encouraged through the use of incentives.  Changing behavior, as opposed to 

  A

  A

  T

  F

   

  A

42 
 

punishment, is the goal of sanctions.  The effective use of these tools will improve the chances 
that the offender will stay engaged in his treatment and will successfully complete the program.      

hile  it  is  important  to  recognize  and  praise  successes,  courts  also  should  consider  the 
challenges  associated  with  the  recovery  process.    For  example,  while  the  court  should 
acknowledge the completion of inpatient drug treatment, the celebration should not be excessive 
because many offenders immediately begin using drugs upon release.  This is especially true if 
there is not a seamless transition to outpatient treatment and/or monitoring.    

f  a  VTC  team  member  discovers  that  the  offender  is  not  complying  with  the  court’s 
requirements, he should contact the team immediately, and the team should address the issue as 
quickly  as  reasonably  possible.    Likewise,  appropriate  behavior  should  be  recognized  by  the 
court  and  the  team  as  quickly  as  possible.    To  address  the  issues  in  a  timely  fashion,  it  might 
occasionally be necessary  to  require  the offender to appear  in  court  on something  other  than  a 
regularly-scheduled  VTC docket day.  The  court  should  address  every infraction,  regardless of 
how minor it appears to be.   

engthy incarceration is rarely an effective response to an infraction.  Research shows that a 24-
hour  period  of  incarceration  is  a  more  effective  sanction  than  a  five-day  period,  and  anything 
longer than five days has no impact on an offender’s future behavior.  Also, many offenders do 
not perceive incarceration to be a punishment because they play cards, watch television, and are 
fed  on  a  regular  basis.    Courts  should  consider  alternative  punishments  such  as  requiring  an 
offender to clean dog cages at an animal shelter.     

hile  some  sanctions  and  incentives  require  expenditures,  not  all  of  them  do.    Applauding  an 
offender’s  good  behavior  or  telling  the  offender  he  did  a  good  job  will  have  an  impact.   
Similarly, many VTCs have noted that a little bit of criticism goes a long way with veterans and 
that severe sanctions may not always be necessary to accomplish the court’s goal if the court is 
merely attempting to get the veteran’s attention. 

ourts should be aware that sanctions which are typically used for substance abusers may not be 
effective  for  individuals  who  have  mental  health  issues.    Likewise,  sanctions  and  incentives 
which are appropriate for non-veterans may not be appropriate for veterans.  Courts may wish to 
consult with a mental health expert who has experience treating veterans.  However, while each 
offender’s situation is somewhat different, courts should treat offenders in as consistent a manner 
as possible.  If the court cannot articulate why the punishment for one offender differs from the 
punishment for another offender for similar behavior, the punishment should not be different.    

inally, the nature of an appropriate response depends on the nature and severity of the violation, 
but an increase in drug use could demonstrate a need to adjust the treatment program, possibly 
from an outpatient program to an inpatient program.  The court should rely on licensed clinicians 
when  making  this  determination  because  placing  the  offender  in  the  wrong  type  of  treatment 
program could adversely affect  the offender in addition to wasting resources.    While  treatment 
programs should be adjusted as necessary, treatment should never be used as a punishment.

Judges  may  wish  to  speak  to  Tennessee  judges  who  preside  over  VTCs  and  other  problem-
solving  courts  because  those  judges  likely  will  have  suggestions  regarding  effective  incentives 
and sanctions.  The AOC has a list of incentives and sanctions which are currently being utilized 
by the Coffee County Mental Health  Court, and  the AOC will forward  it to  interested persons 
upon request.  Also, the AOC attended a training regarding this issue and is available to discuss 
it upon request.  Finally, there are some additional resources noted below.

VETERANS TREATMENT COURT PHASES 

aving  phases  in  a  problem-solving  court  is  important  because  it  provides  structure  for  the 
participant,  clearly  establishes  the  court’s  expectations,  and  allows  the  participants  to  measure 
their success in identifiable increments.  Due to the nature of their military service, structure is 
particularly important for individuals who have served, or are currently serving, in the military.  
The VTC’s participant handbook should include information regarding these phases.   

 problem-solving court is most successful if the offender is required to maintain 12 months of 
sobriety.  Therefore, while an offender likely will conclude his formal drug/alcohol/mental health 
treatment  prior  to  the  conclusion  of  the  12-month  period,  it  is  important  for  the  VTC  team  to 
continue  monitoring  the  offender.    Although  the  program  lengths  can  vary,  participation  in  a 
problem-solving court should average approximately 12 months for offenders with drug/alcohol 
issues, and 18-24 months for offenders with co-occurring disorders.  The length of the program 
will be one factor for an offender to consider when determining whether he wishes to participate.  
A  minor  offender,  for  example,  may  prefer  to  serve  a  short  sentence  as  opposed  to  entering  a 
lengthy treatment court program.   

s previously mentioned, problem-solving courts take a holistic approach and address numerous 
issues such as housing, education, and employment in addition to addressing the substance abuse 
and/or mental health issues.  The goal is for the person to be a healthy, employed, law-abiding 
citizen  at  the  conclusion  of  the  program  and  thereafter.    When  determining  the  phases  of  the 

  T

  T

  W

   

  H

  A

  A

44 
 

program, the court should recognize that during the early stages of recovery it will be important 
for the offender to focus on his recovery as opposed to finding a job or furthering his education.   

he  number  of  phases,  length  of  each  phase,  and  requirements  for  each  phase  should  be 
determined by the VTC team.  The team members should be flexible and should reconsider their 
approach  if  they  find  that  the  initial  approach  is  not  working  well.    How  quickly  an  offender 
moves through each phase will depend on the offender’s individual needs and circumstances as 
well as whether the offender complies with the requirements of each phase.  The team may wish 
to  create  a  different  track  for  offenders  who  receive  inpatient  treatment  than  the  track  for 
offenders who receive outpatient treatment.  For example, phase one for an outpatient offender 
would  likely  be  phase  two  for  an  inpatient  offender  since  the  inpatient  offender  would  be 
focusing exclusively on treatment during the first phase.     

he AOC is providing some general guidance below regarding VTC phases and is available for 
further consultation upon request.  Much of the court phase information was provided by Judge 
Patricia Marks, who presided over a VTC in Rochester, New York, prior to her retirement and 
served as faculty during the one-week VTC training the AOC attended.   
 

PHASE ONE 

ome  VTC  representatives  refer  to  phase  one  as  the  “show  up  phase”  because  some  veterans 
who have mental health and substance abuse issues are capable of doing little more than “show 
up” for court hearings, treatment appointments, and supervision appointments at this early stage 
of recovery.  Therefore, this phase could focus on completing treatment (including abiding by the 
rules associated with that treatment), participating in offense-related classes (domestic violence 
classes, for example), submitting to drug tests, reporting to a probation officer or case manager, 
securing stable and orderly housing, taking required medications, abiding by the law (such that 
there are no new arrests), abiding by probation requirements such as a curfew, if applicable, and 
making regular court appearances.   

his also might be a good phase in which to require a veteran to determine whether he is entitled 
to any non-medical benefits through the VA, TDVA, or other agencies.  If after considering the 
offender’s  physical  and  mental  state  the  VTC  team  believes  that  the  offender  is  capable  of 
pursuing  these  benefits  on  his  own,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  require  him  to  do  so  because 
personally  seeking  and  securing  those  benefits  will  provide  the  offender  with  a  sense  of  pride 
and accomplishment.  Otherwise, VTC mentors or team members can assist the veteran in this 
endeavor.

ith  regard  to  housing,  the  court  might  find  it  necessary  to  direct  the  offender  to  make 
alternative arrangements if the offender is, for example, living with someone who is using drugs.  
This  could  be  somewhat  problematic  for  offenders,  though,  if  they  have  limited  resources.   
Although the VA can provide some assistance for persons who qualify, there are very strict rules, 
and if an offender’s name is on a lease the offender is not considered “homeless” for the purpose 
of receiving benefits even if the offender needs to move because a roommate is a bad influence.   
 

45 
 

The frequency of drug testing should be determined by the VTC team and will vary depending 
upon  the  offender’s  circumstances,  the  phase  of  the  program,  and  the  available  resources.  
Typically,  the  testing  is  more  frequent  during  the  early  phase(s)  of  the  program,  decreases  in 
frequency thereafter, and increases again shortly prior to completion of the program.  Transition 
periods,  including  approaching  the  end  of  a  treatment  court  program,  are  critical  periods  for 
substance abusers, and relapses are not uncommon.   

egardless of the frequency, it is well settled that any testing should be random and observed or 
it  won’t  be  a  successful  tool  in  the  offender’s  recovery.    It  also  is  recommended  that  courts 
utilize  labs  which  are  certified  by  the  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services 
Administration (“SAMHSA”).  SAMHSA certifies labs as opposed to particular drug tests.  At 
the  very  least,  drug  testers  should  check  photo  IDs  and  should  observe  the  test.    Not  all 
facilities/labs do this.   

he  cost  of  a  drug  test  varies  depending  on  the  type  of  test  which  is  requested.    However,  it 
would  be  a  mistake  to  test  only  for  the  offender’s  drug  of  choice  because  the  offender  will 
attempt to evade detection by taking a different drug.  Courts also should be aware that drug tests 
are not foolproof and that a negative drug screen simply could mean that the drug test which was 
utilized was not designed to detect the drug which is being used by the offender.  New drugs are 
being developed each day, and drug tests simply cannot keep up.  Therefore, VTC team members 
should be cognizant of behavioral changes even if a drug test fails to detect drug use.   

he  AOC  possesses  additional  information  regarding  drug  testing  procedures,  methods  of 
detecting attempts to  “cheat”  the  drug test, shortcomings of particular drug tests, etc., and that 
information will be made available to courts upon request.   
 

PHASE TWO 

uring  the  second  phase  of  the  problem-solving  court  program,  a  court  could  require  the 
offender to devise an educational and/or vocational plan which could be executed at a later date 
(maybe later in this phase or in the final phase of the program).  The court also could require the 
offender  to  participate  in  prosocial  activities,  which  could  include  such  things  as  performing 
community service or joining various community groups.   It also would benefit the offender if 
the court required him to develop a budget or other financial plan.  This should include a plan for 
paying applicable fees,  costs and/or restitution  associated with  the  offense at  issue and/or  with 
participation in the VTC itself.  There may be programs through the VA or through community 
resources  which  will  assist  an  offender  who  wishes  to  develop  budgeting  skills.    Finally,  the 
court  could  require  the  offender  to  attend  AA/NA  meetings,  continue  his  treatment  (if 
necessary),  maintain  sobriety,  submit  to  random  drug  tests,  and  continue  taking  required 
medications.    Of  course,  the  nature  of  the  requirements  will  vary  depending  upon  whether  the 
offender has a substance abuse issue, a mental health issue, or both.   

hether sobriety should be a requirement for an offender who has a mental health issue but who 
does  not  have  a  substance  abuse  issue  is  something  for  the  VTC  team  to  consider.    If  the 
offender’s mental health medication cannot be taken with alcohol, it will be easier to answer that 
question.

f  an  offender  has  a  substance  abuse  problem,  the  court  may  wish  to  consider  precluding  him 
from securing prescriptions for narcotics without the court’s permission.  Judge Marks provided 
the AOC with a copy of a letter which her treatment court participants were required to present 
to their doctors.  The AOC will provide courts with an electronic copy of the letter upon request, 
but the text of the letter provides in relevant part as follows: 
 

To Medical Treatment Provider/Doctor: 

our  patient,  ___________________________  is  a  participant  in  a  Monroe 
County  Adult  Criminal  Treatment  Court  Program,  and  is  court  ordered  to 
participate in a substance abuse treatment program.  He/She has been assigned to 
this program due to ongoing and significant substance dependence.   

our  patient  has  provided  documentation  indicating  that  you  have  prescribed 
medication  with  addictive  properties  as  part  of  his/her  treatment.    Please  verify 
your  knowledge  of  the  patient’s  involvement  in  chemical  dependency  treatment 
and that you feel the current course of treatment is necessary, as there are no other 
alternative  forms  of  treatment  that  will  effectively  address  the  patient’s  medical 
needs. 

o  ensure  that  this  is  a  valid  prescription  and  you  have  received  this  letter,  the 
participant  must  return  this  letter  with  the  information  below,  and  include  an 
authorized signature.

PHASE THREE 

n  phase  three,  the  court  may  wish  to  add  a  requirement  that  the  offender  secure  employment 
and/or  attend  school  (or  a  GED  program)  on  a  full-time  basis.    As  with  other  aspects  of  the 
treatment court program, the VTC team should be flexible and should consider each offender’s 
individual  circumstances  when  determining  the  nature  of  the  requirements.    However,  the 
requirements  should  be  as  consistent  as  possible  for  all  offenders.    Absent  this  consistency, 
resentment may become an impediment to a successful program if some offenders feel that the 
court is treating them unfairly relative to other offenders.

GRADUATION 

ach  VTC handles graduation  differently,  but all VTCs praise the graduates’  accomplishments 
and many of them give the graduates a VTC coin which displays military insignia as well as the 
name  of  the  court.    Coins  have  significance  in  substance  abuse  recovery  programs  and  in  the 
military, so VTC graduates appreciate receiving them. A VTC which is located in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania provided the AOC with one of its coins, and the coin is available for viewing upon 
request.  

any  VTCs  have  an  aftercare/alumni  program,  and  this  is  particularly  important  for  veterans 
who were treated for substance abuse issues.  As previously noted, transition periods are difficult 
for substance abusers, and relapses are not uncommon.  Therefore, a VTC team member should 
contact the graduate in person or via telephone on a monthly basis (if not more frequently), get 
an update on his progress, monitor him for signs of relapse, and make any necessary treatment or 
aftercare referrals.   
 

TERMINATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM PROGRAM 

he VTC team should discuss the circumstances in which an offender who is participating in a 
VTC should be  terminated from the program.   As discussed elsewhere in  this  report,  the court 
should anticipate that offenders will commit minor violations of the court’s rules.  As such, those 
violations should result in a sanction as opposed to termination from the program.  Termination 
would be more appropriate if the offender’s continued participation is a threat to public safety or 
a  threat  to  the  integrity  of  the  program,  the  offender  commits  a  new  offense  which  is  a 
disqualifying  offense  for  the  program,  the  offender  habitually  violates  the  court’s  rules,  or  the 
offender is not improving and the court has exhausted available treatment resources.  It should be 
noted, however, that termination is not permitted absent the procedural protections required by 
the  relevant  statutory  and  constitutional  provisions.    See  State  v.  Stewart,  No.  W2009-00980-
CCA-R3-CD  (Tenn.  Crim.  App.,  filed  Aug.  19,  2010,  at  Jackson)  and  Chapter  8  of  The  Drug 
Court  Judicial  Benchbook  (http://www.ndci.org/publications/more-publications/-drug-court-
judicial-benchbook).   

ccasionally, it also may be necessary for a participant to voluntarily withdraw from a VTC due 
to a change in circumstances.  For example, a request to withdraw may be due to a previously-
undiagnosed  medical  condition  which  is  terminal  or  which  otherwise  precludes  the  participant 
from completing the program.   

COSTS AND FUNDING OPTIONS 

s  previously  noted,  the  AOC’s  fiscal  note  support  form  is  attached  as  Appendix  A  to  this 
report, and it includes the AOC’s comments regarding HB3394, which proposed the creation of 
VTCs in 2012.  Some of the AOC’s comments are procedural in nature, and others reference the 
bill’s  financial  impact.    The  AOC  submitted  that  form  prior  to  conducting  this  study,  and  the 
AOC was unfamiliar with VTCs at that time.  While some of the AOC’s comments would differ 

  E

  M

  T

  O

   

  A

48 
 

now that it has a better understanding of VTCs, many of the comments would remain the same.  
Therefore, interested persons may wish to review that form.      

he  costs  associated  with  VTCs  will  vary  greatly  depending  upon  the  community’s  available 
resources, the existence of a problem-solving court which can accommodate veterans and service 
members,  the  type  of  VTC  (pre-adjudication,  post-adjudication,  hybrid),  the  availability  of 
existing staff, and the size and scope of the VTC, including such things as whether veterans will 
only be eligible for  participation  if  they  are eligible for  VA benefits.  The AOC has  identified 
potential  costs  and  possible  funding  options  below.    The  key  to  sustaining  a  VTC  or  other 
problem-solving court is diversified funding.  Courts simply cannot depend upon one source for 
all funding needs. 
 

Treatment And Screening Costs 

here will be costs associated with screening, assessing and treating VTC participants.  Although 
the VA is dedicated to providing veterans with necessary services, the VA has limited resources, 
and  an  increasingly  large  number  of  individuals  are  seeking  treatment.    Numerous  individuals 
and publications have speculated that the VA does not have an adequate number of mental health 
and  substance  abuse  treatment  programs  to  serve  veterans  in  a  timely  fashion  and  that  the 
drawdown will exacerbate that problem.  Moreover, although the VA gives treatment priority to 
certain  categories  of  veterans  due  to  its  limited  resources,  the  VA’s  priority  list  does  not  give 
treatment priority to veterans who have been charged with a criminal offense.6
  If the necessary 
treatment programs are not available within a reasonable period of time, there is not an available 
cost-free state program, or a veteran does not qualify for VA benefits/treatment, the veteran will 
not be permitted to participate in the VTC, the court will be required to pay for the treatment, or 
the  veteran  will  be  required  to  pay  for  the  treatment.    For  indigent  veterans,  the  latter  is  not  a 
viable option unless the treatment provider charges on a sliding scale based upon income.   
 
Assuming that there is an available VA treatment program and assuming further that the veteran 
has  transportation  and/or  that  the  program  is  conveniently  located,  some  veterans  will  require 
longer-term treatment than the VA provides.  Any additional treatment in the private sector will 
come  at  a  cost.    The  AOC  also  notes  that  treatment  provided  by  the  VA  is  not  always  free  of 
cost.  Depending upon the nature of the treatment and the veteran’s status, a co-payment may be 
required.   

inally,  there  may  be  circumstances  in  which  the  VA  declines  to  provide  substance  abuse  or 
mental  health  treatment  to  an  otherwise  qualified  veteran.    For  example,  if  a  veteran  has 
previously  participated  in  multiple  VA  inpatient  substance  abuse  treatment  programs,  the  VA 
may  decline  future  requests  for  inpatient  treatment.    The  rationale  is  that  the  VA  provided  the 
veteran with the required “tools” for recovery during the previous treatment, that reiterating the 
same information will not benefit the veteran (and, presumably, would not be cost effective for

6 The AOC read an article which indicated that veterans who are charged with criminal offenses are given treatment 
priority, and this was not consistent with information gathered by the AOC during its study.  Therefore, the AOC 
contacted the VA and confirmed that criminal offenders are not given priority. For additional information regarding 
VA priority issues, see http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/resources/priority_groups.asp.

the  VA),  and  that  it  is  the  veteran’s  responsibility  to  utilize  the  previously-imparted 
tools/guidance to advance his recovery instead of reentering treatment.              

ith regard to active service members, treatment may be available on a military base or in the 

private sector via TRICARE (http://www.tricare.mil), which is the military’s insurance. 
 

Staff 

 VTC cannot function without the required personnel, including the judge, prosecutor, defense 
counsel,  law  enforcement  officer,  probation  officer,  mentor  coordinator,  program  coordinator, 
program  evaluator,  treatment  provider  and  case  manager.    Although  mentors  should  be 
volunteers,  mentor  coordinators  are  often  paid  by  VTCs.    The  AOC  assumes  that  a  law 
enforcement officer and probation officer would not charge additional fees for their participation 
in a VTC.  However, if a VTC is a pre-disposition court, it is unlikely that the veteran will be 
supervised by a probation officer who is paid by the county or the state.  For example, as noted 
elsewhere in this report, state probation officers are not authorized to supervise someone who is 
granted pretrial diversion.  If a state or county probation officer does not supervise a veteran or if 
the probation officer is not authorized to perform home visits and the VTC does not have a law 
enforcement officer on staff who is able to perform that task, the VTC will be required to hire 
someone to perform the supervision services.   

s  noted  above,  the  court  also  will  need  a  case  manager,  program  coordinator,  and  program 
evaluator.    A  case  manager  oversees  all  aspects  (treatment  and  non-treatment)  of  each 
participant’s case and works closely with each participant from the moment the person enters the 
program to the moment the person graduates or is terminated from the program.  It is possible for 
a probation officer to serve in this capacity, but only if the officer can fulfill all of the required 
duties,  including  remaining  in  close  contact  with  the  participant  throughout  all  phases  of  the 
VTC.    In  contrast,  the  program  coordinator  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  entire  program 
(including  the  budget  and  the  functions  of  all  VTC  team  members),  coordinating  with 
community-based providers, and securing funding. 

lthough the case manager and program coordinator should be two different people, it may be 
possible for one of those individuals to serve as the program evaluator as well.  However, if the 
VTC has a large number  of participants, the court  may  be required to hire  more  than one case 
manager.  The number of people a court is required to hire also depends upon whether the court 
currently  has  any  employees  whose  existing  job  duties  and  skills  provide  them  with  adequate 
time and expertise to perform VTC functions.

  T

he  AOC  will  defer  to  the  District  Public  Defenders  Conference  and  the  District  Attorneys 
General  Conference  regarding  whether  additional  staff  will  be  required,  although  the  AOC 
anticipates  that  the  answer  will  vary  depending  upon  the  specific  language  of  any  proposed 
legislation.  Assuming the legislature does not file legislation, the AOC assumes that courts will 
establish  VTCs  or  otherwise  assist  justice-involved  veterans  in  whatever  manner  existing 
resources will allow.  In other words, if a court is permitted to address veterans’ issues within the 
existing framework of the court system and to create a separate VTC if resources allow, the AOC 
anticipates that there may not be additional personnel costs for prosecutors and public defenders.  

50 
 

In  contrast,  if  the  legislature  mandates  statewide  creation  of  VTCs  regardless  of  the  current 
caseloads of prosecutors and public defenders, the AOC anticipates that additional staff may be 
requested.  As previously discussed, VTCs and other problem-solving courts are time-consuming 
and labor-intensive endeavors, and they place a significant burden upon all VTC team members.   
 

Miscellaneous Non-Treatment Costs 

n addition to the costs listed above, VTCs may require expenditures for the following:  (1) Drug 
testing; (2)  Alcohol monitoring devices, such as  SCRAM (Secure Continuous  Remote Alcohol 
Monitor); (3) Incentives  (gift cards, movie passes, bus passes, etc.); (3) Veteran transportation; 
(4)  Secure  computer  program  for  evaluation  purposes  (if  not  utilizing  DMH’s  TN-WITS 
system);  (5)  VTC  team  member  travel;  (6)  Training;  (7)  Miscellaneous  office  supplies  and 
postage; and (8) Screening for level of risk (As previously noted, high-risk, high-need offenders 
are the most appropriate offenders for participation in a problem-solving court).  

t is possible that community partners would be willing to offset some of these costs.  Similarly, 
if a veteran is being supervised by a state or county probation officer, that officer might provide 
drug testing and risk screening.  However, VTCs likely will require more frequent drug testing 
than is permitted under standard probationary guidelines.   

f  the  legislature  mandates  the  creation  of  VTCs,  identifies  a  recurring  funding  source,  and 
directs the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services to administer the newly-
created fund, the AOC will defer to that department regarding whether it will require additional 
staff. 
 

Resource Mapping 

the 

following  non-treatment  needs  and  potential 

s previously discussed, a problem-solving court does not focus exclusively on substance abuse 
and  mental  health  treatment.    Instead,  the  court  focuses  on  any  factors  which  may  affect  a 
participant’s ability to become a productive citizen.  Each VTC (or other problem-solving court) 
will be required to perform a resource mapping exercise to determine what resources are locally 
available.    Judge  Patricia  Marks  (New  York  VTC)  recommended  that  problem-solving  courts 
law 
consider 
enforcement/probation; (2) recreational/libraries; (3) mental health services; (4) family therapy;

State Legislative Funding 

either the AOC nor any participant in this study has identified a recurring state revenue source 
which could be utilized to fund VTCs.  Moreover, Tennessee’s drug treatment courts and other 
problem-solving courts such as mental health treatment courts are not being adequately funded, 
and  the  AOC  is  concerned  that  diverting  any  funding  sources  to  VTCs  will  cause  additional 
hardship  for  the  existing  problem-solving  courts.    In  January  2012,  Governor  Bill  Haslam’s 
Subcabinet  Working  Group  submitted  a  Public  Safety  Action  Plan  which  recognized  the 
importance  of  expanding  access  to  drug  treatment  courts  and  adequately  funding  those  courts.   
See http://news.tn.gov/system/files/PUBLIC%20SAFETY%20ACTION%20PLAN.pdf.  

ennessee’s drug treatment courts and other problem-solving courts are receptive to addressing 
veteran-specific  issues.    Indeed,  the  majority  of  the  judges  to  whom  the  AOC  spoke  indicated 
that  veterans  currently  participate  in  their  problem-solving  courts.    Therefore,  if  a  recurring 
funding source is identified, the AOC encourages the legislature to authorize additional funding 
for  problem-solving  courts  which  incorporate  veterans  into  their  programs  in  addition  to 
authorizing funding for free-standing VTCs.   

he  AOC’s  fiscal  note  support  form  for  HB3394  provided  as  follows  with  regard  to  the 

legislature’s proposal to fund VTCs via a $25.00 fine for criminal offenders: 
 

With  regard  to  funding,  Section  14  proposes  a  $25.00  fee  for  the  four  listed 
categories  of  persons.    As  previously  noted,  this  legislation  authorizes  the  court 
clerk to take $5.00 of this fee (it’s unclear whether this is in addition to the clerk’s 
currently-authorized  commission).    In  addition  to  considering  how  much  of  the 
$25.00 clerks will be taking, Fiscal Review should consider how many offenders 
will  actually  pay  the  $25.00  fee.    Approximately  75%  of  criminal  offenders  are 
indigent and will not be capable of paying such a fee or any other costs/taxes/fines 
associated with their prosecution.  Given the current state of the economy as well 
as  the  numerous  fines/fees/taxes  imposed  upon  litigants  in  criminal  courts,  it  is 
unlikely that the remaining 25% of the offenders will be capable of paying their 
court  bills  in  full.    Based  upon  the  relevant  statutes  and  other  pertinent 
information,  the  automated  system  utilized  by  many  clerks’  offices  prioritizes 
(and distributes) incoming payments in the following order:  state litigation taxes, 
county litigation taxes, clerk fees, other fees due to the county (officer cost, etc.), 
other fees due to the state, fines, and restitution.  Because offenders are unlikely 
to pay their bills in full and because the revenue which is generated must be used 
to satisfy so many other obligations prior to being utilized for the veterans courts, 
the  AOC  believes  that  the  $25.00  fee  imposed  by  this  legislation  is  unlikely  to 
generate a substantial amount of revenue.   

  N

hile the AOC believes this is an accurate assessment, there are additional considerations which 
were not mentioned.  For example, any revenue generated by such a fee (or any other proposed 

52 
 

recurring revenue source) would not be accessible immediately by VTCs because it would take 
time for those fines to be assessed (at the conclusion of a criminal proceeding) and paid, and it 
also would take time for those payments to accumulate in any meaningful way.  Indeed, it is the 
AOC’s understanding that it took approximately  three  years for the drug  court fees to  generate 
substantial funds and that a non-recurring fund of $1,000,000 was initially utilized to support the 
drug treatment courts.  Therefore, even if the legislature identifies a recurring funding source for 
VTCs, the AOC encourages the legislature to provide non-recurring funding for the VTCs’ initial 
years of operations.  

dditionally,  the  AOC  notes  that  VTCs  are  designed  to  help  justice-involved  veterans  and 
service members who have substance abuse and mental health issues.  While the AOC does not 
dispute  that  this  is  a  worthy  cause,  the  AOC  questions  why  the  burden  of  funding  this  service 
should  be  borne  solely  by  criminal  offenders  as  opposed  to  being  borne  equally  by  all 
Tennesseans.    
 

Pending Federal Legislation 

s  the  AOC  noted  in  its  interim  report,  H.R.  5326  appropriates  $4,000,000  for  veterans 
treatment  courts.    It  has  passed  the  House  of  Representatives  but  has  not  passed  the  Senate.   
While $4,000,000 is not adequate to fund the numerous VTCs throughout the country and courts 
likely will be precluded from utilizing those funds for violent offenders, any funding efforts by 
Congress should be encouraged.   
 

Other Funding Sources 

uring the AOC’s study, multiple participants mentioned the availability of federal grants.  The 
AOC agrees that grants are one source of funding  for VTCs and other problem-solving courts.  
However, VTCs will not be sustainable if they rely exclusively upon grants for funding.  Courts 
must have adequate staff to complete the grant applications, to compile any required data, and to 
comply  with  any  necessary  reporting  requirements  following  the  rewarding  of  a  grant.   
Assuming  courts  have  adequate  staff  to  perform  these  tasks,  which  they  do  not,  it  is  still 
important to recognize the limitations of grants.   First, grants are competitive in nature.  A court 
is  not  guaranteed  to  receive  a  grant  merely  because  it  applies  for  one.    Moreover,  grant  funds 
must be used for very specific purposes, and there are many VTC expenses for which grant funds 
cannot  be used.  Most  importantly,  grants are  of limited duration, and  the court system  should 
not create a VTC with grant funds if the court system does not have access to non-grant funding 
which  is  adequate  to  sustain  the  VTC  at  the  same  level  following  the  expiration  of  the  grant.  
Therefore, while grants are one source of funding they cannot be the exclusive source.   

f a VTC or another problem-solving court is interested in applying for a grant which requires a 
letter of support, the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (“DMH”) has 
indicated  that  it  will  provide  a  court  with  such  a  letter  upon  request.    Moreover,  if  a  VTC  is 
willing  to  go  through  the  required  certification  process  (during  a  time  period  in  which  that 
process  is  being  offered),  DMH  has  indicated  that  it  may  have  limited  operational  funds 
available  for  VTCs.    However,  those  are  the  same  funds  which  currently  are  being  utilized  by 
Tennessee’s  drug  treatment  courts  and,  as  previously  noted,  those  courts  are  not  being 

  A

  A

  D

  I

53 
 

adequately  funded.    Therefore,  while  the  AOC  applauds  DMH  for  offering  funds,  the  AOC  is 
concerned that assisting VTCs will adversely affect drug treatment courts.  The AOC encourages 
the legislature to increase funding for drug treatment courts and to identify a new and recurring 
funding source for VTCs.  
      
Courts  also  may  wish  to  consult  with  local  groups  which  have  received  grants  for  veteran-
specific programs or which may offer such programs even if not via a grant.  For example, the 
Appalachian  Regional  Coalition  on  Homelessness,  which  is  based  in  Johnson  City  but  serves 
eight  counties,  received  a  grant  to  provide  housing  and  support  services  for  qualified  veterans 
and their families. 

imilarly,  local  organizations  may  provide  services  to  any  person,  including  a  veteran.    For 
example, in 2012 the Crumley House in Washington County was provided with $100,000 in state 
funding  “for  the  provision  of  programs  and  services  on  behalf  of  persons  suffering  from 
traumatic brain injuries.” 

unds  or  other  support  also  may  be  available  through  one  of  the  following  sources,  although 
some  may  state  that  the  funding  cannot  be  used  for  violent  offenders:    (1)  Bureau  of  Justice 
Assistance (distributes Department of Justice’s funds); (2) Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (“SAMHSA”); (3) Department of Housing and Urban Development; (4) 
Department  of  Labor;  (5)  Center  for  Substance  Abuse  Prevention;  (6)  Center  for  Substance 
Abuse  Treatment;  (7)  Veterans  Administration  –  Supportive  Services  for  Veteran  Families 
Grant;  (8)  Veterans  Service  Organizations  (DAV,  VVA,  VFW,  etc.);  (9)  Faith-based 
organizations;  (10) Social service agencies; and (11) Philanthropic arm or foundation of a local 
company.    In contrast to a federal grant, philanthropic groups usually have a relatively simple 
application process and do not place restrictions upon  the  manner in  which  a  VTC may  utilize 
the funds.    

everal VTC staff members also noted the  importance  of  publicity.  Individuals and companies 
often contribute financially to a VTC after the VTC staff members participate in a Veterans Day 
parade or the local newspaper writes an article about the VTC.   

inally, courts may generate funds by charging each participant a monthly fee.  The AOC spoke 
to numerous VTC judges and staff members nationwide who stated that in addition to requiring 
participants to pay all court costs, fines, fees, restitution, child support, etc. over the course of the 
program, they charge monthly fees to help offset the costs of bus passes, drug tests, incentives 
and other VTC expenditures.  Although some courts waive those fees for indigent offenders, they 
noted  that  the  majority  of  the  offenders,  even  if  indigent  upon  entering  the  program,  are  no 
longer indigent after they begin their substance abuse treatment and are no longer spending their 
money  on  alcohol  or  other  drugs.    If  a  veteran  is  indigent,  one  VTC  stated  that  it  requires  the 
veteran to make toys, knit small pieces of clothing, or make other items which are then donated 
to  charity.    This  assists  the  community  and  also  boosts  the  veteran’s  self  esteem  because  the 
veteran is helping others instead of focusing exclusively on his own problems.

Ethical Issues 

here  are  ethical  issues  associated  with  VTCs,  especially  with  regard  to  fundraising.    Judges 
should  consult  with  other  problem-solving  judges  regarding  the  issues  they’ve  encountered.   
Judges also may wish to consult the Code of Judicial Conduct (Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10, RJC 3.7), 
and Chapter 10 of The Drug Court Judicial Benchbook (http://www.ndci.org/publications/more-
publications/-drug-court-judicial-benchbook).    If  judges  have  additional  questions,  the  Judicial 
Ethics Committee is available for consultation. 

ue  to  potential  ethical  issues,  many  judges  and  VTC  personnel  with  whom  the  AOC  spoke 
stated that they created what’s commonly referred to as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  See 
26 U.S.C. §501(c)(3).  Others utilize a 501(c)(3) pass through, which allows them to pay a fee to 
partner with an organization which qualifies as a 501(c)(3).

WHAT IS DIVERSION? 

uring  its  study  of  the  VTC  issue,  the  AOC  discovered  that  many  interested  persons 
misunderstood the substantive and procedural provisions of pretrial and judicial diversion.   As a 
result, there is considerable confusion regarding the manner in which diversion could be utilized 
by a VTC.  A summary of each type of diversion is provided below.     
 

Pretrial Diversion 

retrial diversion is addressed in great detail in Tennessee Code Annotated Title 40, Chapter 15, 
Part 1, and the AOC will not include all of those details in this report.   However, as a  general 
rule, pretrial diversion is a procedure through which minor offenders, with the agreement of the 
District Attorney General, seek  to avoid  prosecution and  potential incarceration by  agreeing to

comply with certain conditions including, but not limited to, not committing criminal offenses, 
not  engaging  in  specified  activities,  participating  in  a  supervised  rehabilitation  program,  and 
paying certain costs/fees/restitution.  The Board of Probation and Parole (now the Department of 
Correction)  does  not  have  the  authority  to  supervise  individuals  who  are  placed  on  pretrial 
diversion, and there are typically minimal reporting requirements as opposed to being subjected 
to intensive supervision.     

n offender is not eligible for pretrial diversion if he is charged with:  (1) a felony; (2) DUI; (3) 
a sex offense listed in Tennessee Code Annotated Title 39, Chapter 13, Part 5; (4) conspiracy or 
attempt  to  commit  a  Class  E  felony  sexual  offense  under  Title  39,  Chapter  13,  Part  5;  (5) 
solicitation  to  commit  Class  D  or  E  felony  sexual  offense  under  Title  39;  or  (6)  certain 
misdemeanor offenses if the offender is an elected/appointed official.  Assuming the offender is 
not  disqualified  due  to  the  nature  of  his  offense,  the  offender  will  still  be  ineligible  if  he  has 
previously  been  granted  pretrial  diversion  or  judicial  diversion  or  has  a  prior  conviction  for  a 
Class A or B misdemeanor or for any felony. 

f the offender is eligible for pretrial diversion and the District Attorney agrees that the offender 
is a good candidate, prosecution will be suspended for a specified period not to exceed two years.  
If the  offender complies  with the  requirements,  the  charges will be  dismissed  and the  offender 
will be eligible for  expungement of his  record.   If the offender  does not successfully  complete 
the  requirements  of  diversion,  the  District  Attorney  has  the  authority  to  proceed  with  the 
prosecution.   

n 2011, the District Attorneys General Conference communicated with the Tennessee General 
Assembly  regarding  its  concerns  about  pretrial  diversion.    There  were  three  primary  concerns.  
First, if an offender fails to comply with the requirements of diversion and the prosecutor opts to 
proceed  with  the  prosecution, it  is difficult for  the  prosecutor  to locate  witnesses  and evidence 
for a crime which occurred years earlier.  Second, if a prosecutor concludes that an offender is 
not  an  appropriate  candidate  for  diversion,  the  trial  and  appellate  courts  review  the  denial  of 
diversion  to  determine  if  the  prosecutor  abused  his  discretion.    Anticipating  this  review, 
prosecutors  spend  a  considerable  amount  of  time  drafting  a  written  explanation  regarding  the 
rationale  for  the  denial.    The  prosecutors  explained  to  the  General  Assembly  that  they  did  not 
believe  this  was  an  efficient  use  of  their  limited  resources.    Finally,  the  prosecutors  explained 
that  determining  whether  an  offender  should  be  granted  diversion/probation  is  a  sentencing 
function which should be performed by a judge as opposed to  a prosecutor.  After  considering 
the prosecutors’ concerns, the General Assembly amended the pretrial diversion statute and, as a 
result, very few offenders are now eligible for pretrial diversion.   
 

Judicial Diversion 

udicial  diversion,  which  is  addressed  in  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  40-35-313,  is 
similar  to  pretrial  diversion  in  that  prosecution  is  temporarily  suspended  after  an  eligible 
offender agrees to comply with certain requirements.  In contrast to pretrial diversion, though, a 
person  who  is  granted  judicial  diversion  has  been  found  guilty  by  a  jury,  has  entered  a  guilty 
plea, or has entered a nolo contendere plea.  However, the court does not issue a final judgment 
during the probationary period.  If the offender does not successfully complete the requirements 

  A

  I

  I

  J

56 
 

of diversion, the court enters the judgment and the offender has a “conviction.”  If the offender 
complies  with  the  requirements  of  diversion,  the  judgment  is  never  entered.    With  certain 
exceptions,  an  offender  who  successfully  completes  diversion  may  apply  to  have  his  record 
expunged.   

he statute governing judicial diversion provides that an offender who is charged with one of the 
following is not eligible for judicial diversion:  (1) a sexual offense (“sexual offense” is defined 
in  the  statute,  and  the  offenses  are  listed);  (2)  a  violation  of  71-6-117  or  71-6-119  (deal  with 
abuse/neglect/exploitation of impaired adult); (3) DUI; (4) a Class A or B felony; or (5) certain 
misdemeanor  offenses  if  the  offender  is  an  elected/appointed  official.    An  offender  also  is 
ineligible for judicial diversion if he has previously been convicted of a felony or of a Class A 
misdemeanor  for  which  a  sentence  of  confinement  was  served,  or  if  he  has  previously  been 
granted judicial diversion or pretrial diversion. 

nlike pretrial diversion, the Board of Probation and Parole (now the Department of Correction) 
has  limited  authority  to  supervise  individuals  who  are  placed  on  judicial  diversion.    However, 
this authority only extends to felons as opposed to misdemeanants. 

ROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING AVAILABLE BENEFITS AND ASSISTANCE FOR 
VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS 

espite its best efforts, the AOC  was unable to  identify  a  user-friendly, uniform procedure for 
judges  and  attorneys  to  utilize  when  determining  the  benefits  to  which  veterans  are  eligible, 
identifying which agencies/groups provide those benefits, and assisting the veterans in accessing 
the benefits.  There are complicated procedures and eligibility requirements at issue with regard 
to state, federal and non-governmental benefits.  Indeed, there are numerous lengthy publications 
and  websites  which  address  those  issues.  The  problem  is  exacerbated  by  the  fact  non-
governmental organizations which purport to be veteran-specific service providers do not always 
act  in  the  best  interest  of  veterans.    At  this  point,  no  agency/group/individual  has  compiled  or 
endorsed a list of legitimate, non-governmental service providers for veterans.  Given the large 
number of groups at issue and the potential for fraud, the AOC understands why the VA and the 
TDVA are being cautious in their approach to this issue.  Indeed, the VA’s website for “Veterans 
Service Organizations” stated (as of 9/26/12): 

The  VSO  web  page  has  been  removed  while  we  determine  a  new  process  and 
policy by which VSOs and MSOs will be listed in VA’s directory. In the interim, 
please  visit  the  Office  of  General  Counsel’s  Accreditation  web  site  to  find 
information  on  accredited  VSO  organizations  and  organizations  chartered  by 
Congress.  

The  accreditation  website  referenced  by  the  VA  can  be  found  at  the  following  address:  
www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp.    

According to  recent news reports, VA officials are “going  after scams that  charge veterans for 
help  to  obtain  benefits.    It’s  illegal  to  charge  a  veteran  for  help  filing  a  claim  for  disability  or

pension  benefits.”    There  are,  however,  some  ways  to  locate  reputable  groups  which  provide 
services  to  veterans.    The  AOC  references  various  groups  and  agencies  throughout  this  report.

organizations  recognized  by  the  Secretary  of  Veterans  Affairs  in  the  preparation,  presentation,

the  United  Tennessee  Veterans  Association  (“UTVA”)  (http://www.tn.gov/veteran/utva.shtml).  
According to TDVA’s website, UTVA 
 

provides communication, cooperation, and unity among affiliated organizations in 
matters  relating  to  Veterans  and  their  family  members.  UTVA  has  created  and 
cultivated  a  cooperative  and  non-partisan  relationship  among  all  federal,  state, 
local,  private  and  public  agencies  and  organizations  that  provide  services  to 
Tennessee Veterans and their family members. 

    
UTVA has quarterly meetings during which the participants are provided with information which 
will assist them  in providing services to  veterans.   Those  meetings  are open to the  public, and 
TDVA’s  website  provides  access  to  the  minutes  and  videos  of  previous  meetings.    The  next 
meeting is scheduled for December 4, 2012, and it will address rural veterans services.  

 court which is considering creating a VTC, or is attempting to assist veterans even if the court 
does not intend  to  create  a VTC,  should  consider contacting  the organizations,  individuals and 
agencies which the AOC has identified throughout this report.  However, the AOC believes that 
courts  ultimately  will  discover  that  the  most  effective  method  of  identifying  reputable  service 
organizations and service providers is for each jurisdiction to handle that issue at the local level, 
where the stakeholders are likely to possess information regarding the sincerity and effectiveness 
of  every  entity  which  claims  to  provide  services  to  veterans.    For  the  purpose  of  securing 
veterans’  benefits,  though,  the  two  most  important  organizations  are  the  United  States 
Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs, which are 
discussed below.   

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND TENNESSEE 
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 

here  are  many  governmental  and  non-governmental  entities  which  offer  services  to  veterans 
and service members.  However, the VA and TDVA are the two primary governmental agencies 
through which qualified veterans access available resources.  The former provides a broad range 
of  services,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  non-medical  benefits.    Both  the  VA  and  TDVA  are 
dedicated  to  serving  veterans,  but  they  have  limited  resources,  and  they  recognize  that 
community partners serve an important role in providing veterans with the needed services.

It  is  the  AOC’s  understanding  that  the  computer  systems  for  VHA,  VBA  and  NCA  are  not

medical  centers’  computers  do  not  share  information  with  each  other,  and  the  Department  of 
Defense’s  (“DOD”)  computers  do  not  share  information  with  the  VA’s  computers.    Although 
DOD and the VA  are  attempting  to combine their files, this is a work  in progress.   Therefore, 
although  there  are  exceptions,  as  a  general  rule  DOD  and  the  VA  currently  maintain  separate 
records for each service member/veteran.

The types of services for which a veteran is eligible through the VBA, VHA, and numerous other 
governmental  and  non-governmental  entities  will  depend,  in  part,  upon  the  nature  of  the 
veteran’s  discharge.    As  previously  noted,  the  types  of  discharge  are  currently  as  follows:    (1) 
Honorable;  (2)  General  Under  Honorable  Conditions;  (3)  Other  Than  Honorable;  (4)  Bad 
Conduct; and (5) Dishonorable.  As a general rule, veterans who received an honorable discharge 
or  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions  are  eligible  for  benefits,  and  veterans  who 
were dishonorably discharged are not eligible for benefits.  Eligibility for veterans who received 
an other than honorable or bad conduct discharge is often discretionary and varies by the type of 
benefit.   

A and TDVA Facilities in Tennessee 

here are VA medical centers, clinics (including CBOC’s (community based outpatient clinics)) 
and  Vet  Centers  located  throughout  Tennessee.    The  clinics  offer  primary  care  services,  some 
basic  mental  health  services,  and  access  to  VA  medical  centers  via  Telehealth,  which  is 
discussed below.  Vet Centers also are discussed below.   

he  TDVA  has  field  offices  throughout  the  state,  and  these  offices  assist  veterans  with  non-
medical  benefits  issues.    Even  if  a  field  office  is  not  located  in  a  particular  county,  every 
Tennessee county is serviced by a field office.  For example, the field office which is located in 
Washington County also services Greene, Unicoi, Carter, Sullivan and Johnson counties.  

lthough the table below includes the location of Tennessee’s VA medical centers, clinics, Vet 
Centers, and other VA and TDVA resources, information often changes, and the websites for the 
VA  and  TDVA  should  be  consulted  to  confirm  the  continued  accuracy  of  this  information.   
Those websites also provide contact information for each of the listed offices/facilities.   

n addition to the resources listed below, many counties have County Veterans Services Officers.

o  access  many  benefits,  the  veteran  will  be  required  to  submit  a  copy  of  VA  Form  DD-214 
(“DD-214”), which is often referred to as a Report of Separation or  a Certificate of Release or 
Discharge from  Active Duty.   The AOC possesses a  redacted  copy of a veteran’s DD-214 and 
will share it with judges and other  interested parties  upon request.  The DD-214 includes such 
information  as  dates  of  service,  type  of  discharge  (honorable,  etc.),  and  branch  of  service.   
Depending upon the nature of a veteran’s service, it is possible that he will have multiple DD-
214s since service members receive a DD-214 each time they are discharged from active duty.  
This  will  be  particularly  true  of  members  of  the  National  Guard  and  Reserves  who  have  been 
activated.

In  theory,  the  most  recent  DD-214  will  be  cumulative.    As  a  practical  matter,  it  is  the  AOC’s 
understanding that the final DD-214 does not always accurately reflect a veteran’s entire history.  
The AOC also has heard that the large volume of paperwork which is being generated as a result 
of  the  recent  drawdowns  has  resulted  in  the  misplacement  of  some  documentation  by  the  VA, 
and this could  affect how quickly  the VA  processes  requests  for DD-214’s and other  benefits-
related requests.   

eterans receive a copy of the DD-214 upon their discharge, so many veterans will have copies 
readily available.  Many veterans also file their DD-214s with the Register of Deeds, and this can 
be  done  at  no  cost  to  the  veteran.    T.C.A.  §  8-21-1001(b)(1).    The  AOC  encourages  service 
members  to  file  their  DD-214s  with  the  Register  of  Deeds  upon  discharge  so  a  copy  will  be 
available  if  the  original  is  misplaced.    Although  service  members  are  statutorily  authorized  to 
request  that  the  social  security  number  be  redacted  from  the  DD-214  upon  its  filing  with  the 
Register  of  Deeds,  service  members  should  be  cognizant  of  the  fact  that  the  social  security 
number  is  important  for  the  purpose  of  securing  benefits.    Therefore,  service  members  should 
inquire  about  the  possibility  of  retaining  the  social  security  number  on  the  filed  copy  while 
redacting it from the version which is publicly accessible. 

f a justice-involved veteran does not possess a copy of his DD-214, there are multiple methods 
of securing a copy at no cost.  If a Veterans’ Justice Outreach Specialist (“VJO”) is working with 
a VTC, the VJO can assist the court in confirming a veteran’s eligibility for services.7
  If one of 
Tennessee’s three VJOs is not available in person or via telephone, the veteran can secure a copy 
of his DD-214 with the assistance of one of the following entities:  (1) County Veterans Service 
Officer; (2) TDVA (main office or field office); (3) TN War Records Division in Nashville (if a 
veteran’s home of record is Tennessee); (4) VA Regional Office in Nashville; (5) Vet Center; or 
(6) VA medical center (benefits officers are located at VA medical centers).  The DD-214 also 
can be  requested  online  through many  governmental and  non-governmental websites.   See, for 
https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-
(
example, 
portal/ebenefits.portal
in  St.  Louis 
(http://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/).    According  to  multiple  sources,

Veterans Health Administration 

he  VHA  is  the  healthcare  branch  of  the  VA.    The  United  States  is  divided  into  23  Veterans 
Integrated  Service  Networks  (“VISN”)  for  veteran  healthcare  purposes,  and  Tennessee  is 
included in VISN 9, which is the VA MidSouth Healthcare Network.  VISN 9 includes parts of 
states other than Tennessee, and VISN 9’s VA medical centers are located in Huntington, West 
Virginia,  Lexington  and  Louisville,  Kentucky,  and  Nashville,  Memphis,  Murfreesboro,  and 
Mountain  Home/Johnson  City,  Tennessee.    As  noted  above,  there  also  are  VA  clinics  and  Vet 
Centers located throughout Tennessee. 

he VA’s 2012 Benefits Booklet summarizes the basic eligibility for health care (VHA) benefits 

as follows: 
 

Basic Eligibility 

  person  who  served  in  the  active  military,  naval,  or  air  service  and  who  was 
discharged or released  under conditions  other than dishonorable may qualify for 
VA  health  care  benefits.  Reservists  and  National  Guard  members  may  also 
qualify for VA health care benefits if they were called to active duty (other than 
for training only) by a Federal order and completed the full period for which they 
were called or ordered to active duty. 

inimum  Duty  Requirements:  Veterans  who  enlisted  after  Sept.  7,  1980,  or 
who  entered  active  duty  after  Oct.  16,  1981,  must  have  served  24  continuous 
months or the full period for which they were called to active duty in order to be 
eligible.  This  minimum  duty  requirement  may  not  apply  to  Veterans  discharged 
for hardship, early out or a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. 

  A

  M

lthough this publication references “other than dishonorable” discharges, the VA informed the 
AOC  that  veterans  are  only  eligible  for  VHA  medical  benefits,  including  mental  health  and 
substance abuse treatment, if they received an honorable discharge or a general discharge under 
honorable  conditions.    Individuals  who  received  an  other  than  honorable,  bad  conduct,  or 
dishonorable discharge are not eligible. 

n  contrast  to  eligibility  requirements  for  certain  VBA  benefits,  the  medical  problem  at  issue 
does  not  have  to  be  related  to  the  veteran’s  military  service  for  the  veteran  to  be  eligible  for 
medical treatment through VHA.  Therefore, regardless of the cause of the medical problem, an 
eligible  justice-involved  veteran  can,  in  theory,  receive  (sometimes  with  a  mandatory  co-pay) 
medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment through VHA.  As a practical matter, the 
VA’s resources are limited, so the necessary treatment may not be easily accessible for veterans 
who live in certain parts of Tennessee.  Moreover, due to high demand there may be delays in 
accessing  the  services  even  if  a  treatment  program  is  offered  at  nearby  facility.    Likewise, 
available  VA mental health and substance abuse  treatment programs are limited  in  length,  and 
justice-involved  veterans  may  require  additional  treatment  following  completion  of  a  VA 
treatment  program.  Finally,  as  previously  discussed,  community-based  treatment  may  be 
necessary  if  an  otherwise-qualified  veteran  no  longer  qualifies  for  mental  health  or  substance

abuse treatment through the VA because the veteran has previously utilized those services.  Any 
of these circumstances would require the expenditure of additional funds by the VTC unless the 
veteran has adequate private insurance, is offered community-based services at no charge, or is 
eligible for treatment through a state program.   

egardless  of  those  limitations,  however,  a  veteran’s  first  step  should  be  to  attempt  to  secure 
treatment through  the  VHA.  To receive  any such  treatment, the veteran  must first “enroll” by 
completing  and  submitting  VA  Form  10-10EZ  (the  submitted  information  can  be  updated  by 
using  VA  Form  10-10EZR).    Some  veterans  enroll  prior  to,  or  shortly  after,  being  discharged 
from service.  However, if a veteran did not do so, he can complete the necessary steps in person 
at  a  VA  medical  center  or  clinic,  via  telephone,  via  mail,  or  online.    For  more  information 
regarding these options  or to  access  the necessary  forms, see https://www.1010ez.med.va.gov/.  
According  to  a  representative  of  the  VA,  it  typically  will  take  approximately  two  weeks 
following  submission  of  Form  10-10EZ  for  a  veteran  to  become  eligible  for  VHA  services 
because  the  VA  must  confirm  the  accuracy  of  the  submitted  information.    However,  this 
timetable  assumes  that  the  form  is  completed  in  full,  and  the  VA’s  representative  stated  that 
many  veterans  do  not  provide  all  of  the  required  information.    Any  omissions  will  result  in 
additional  enrollment  delays  because  the  VA  will  be  required  to  notify  the  veteran  of  the 
omissions and await receipt of the requested information.8
 
After  a  veteran  completes  the  necessary  enrollment  paperwork  and  is  approved  for  VHA 
services, the veteran can contact any VA medical center or clinic to request treatment.  Typically, 
the  veteran  will  be  assigned  to  a  primary  care  physician,  who  will  then  refer  the  veteran  to 
specialists  as  necessary.    Primary  care  physicians  are  located  at  every  VA  medical  center  and 
clinic, but specialists, including substance abuse and mental health treatment specialists, are only 
located  at  a  limited  number  of  facilities.    The  VA  has  the  ability  to  refer  veterans  to  non-VA 
facilities for treatment when the necessary treatment is not available through a VA facility, but 
the  authorized  non-VA  facilities  also  are  somewhat  limited  and  are  not  easily  accessible  by 
veterans in  all areas of Tennessee.  The AOC was unable to locate a VA employee who could 
provide a list of all VA or VA-approved drug, alcohol and/or mental health treatment facilities in 
Tennessee.   

        

ith  regard  to  substance  abuse  treatment,  an  initial  assessment  will  be  conducted  by  an 
addiction therapist or another appropriate VA employee.  This assessment will indicate whether 
treatment is necessary and, if so, whether outpatient (typically utilized for “abuse”) or inpatient 
(typically utilized for “dependence”) treatment would be most effective for the veteran at issue.  
The  VA  is  governed  by  numerous  federal  laws,  and  it  will  only  provide  treatment  which  is 
statutorily authorized and which is appropriate for a particular veteran.  In other words, the VA, 
not the VTC judge, will determine what services the VA will provide.     

ith  regard  to  mental  health  issues,  a  physician,  psychologist,  nurse  practitioner  or  licensed 
clinical  social  worker  will  diagnose  the  veteran  and  recommend  any  necessary  treatment.  
Emergency mental health treatment is available at VA medical centers and may be available at 
some VA clinics as well.    
                                                 
8 While formal approval is pending, a veteran can informally assess his eligibility for VHA services by answering 
the questions at http://www.va.gov/healtheligibility/Library/Tools/Quick_Eligibility_Check/index.asp.

If a court establishes a relationship with a VJO or a representative of VHA or VBA and if any 
necessary VA waivers are filed, it may be possible for the VTC to quickly establish whether a 
defendant  is  a  VHA-eligible  veteran  by  providing  the  defendant’s  name  and  social  security 
number or military serial number to the VA’s representative.  However, eligible veterans will not 
be assigned  to a  primary care physician or be  referred to a specialist for  any  necessary  mental 
health or substance abuse treatment until  the  veteran  has officially enrolled  by using  Form 10-
10EZ.  Official enrollment is not required for a veteran to receive emergency medical treatment, 
however.    

eterans who utilize the VHA system will be provided with a Veteran Identification Card (VIC) 
by  a  VA  medical  facility.    This  card  will  be  used  for  VA  healthcare  identification  and

For 

 
Telehealth and My HealtheVet 

ligible veterans always have the option of making an appointment with a doctor, therapist, or 
other medical professional at a VA medical center or clinic, but a veteran who lives a significant 
distance from a medical center, who is not comfortable driving due to age or illness, or who has 
limited access to transportation may find it difficult to access those services.  The VA now offers 
more  access  to  services  through  its  Telehealth  program.    For  VTC  purposes,  the  two  most 
important aspects of this program are Home Telehealth and Clinical Video Telehealth.     

ome  Telehealth  assists  veterans  with  monitoring  and  managing  chronic  conditions  such  as 
diabetes  and  congestive  heart  failure.    The  system,  which  is  home-based,  reminds  the  veteran 
when to test his blood sugar levels, when to take his medication, etc.  It then allows the veteran 
to  electronically  submit  information  such  as  blood  pressure  and  blood  sugar  levels  and  also 
allows a veteran to answer daily questions related to his condition.  A care coordinator such as a 
nurse  or  social  worker  monitors  these  submissions,  consults  with  other  medical  personnel  as 
necessary, and communicates with the veteran regarding any issues which arise as a result of the 
submissions.  Veterans are not required to pay for the devices which are utilized in this program.  
Those devices are prescribed and provided by the VA just as a wheelchair or assistive device in 
the home would be prescribed.   

s noted elsewhere in this report, Tennessee has four VA medical centers and numerous clinics.  
Primary care physicians are located in the clinics, but specialists typically are only located at the 
larger urban medical centers.  If a veteran lives closer to a clinic than a medical center, it might 
benefit  the  veteran  to  utilize  the  Clinical  Video  Telehealth  program.    This  program  allows  a 
veteran to be “treated” by a specialist via video systems located at the clinic (site of veteran) and 
medical center (site of VA clinician).  This system allows the specialist to not only have visual 
contact and interaction with the veteran but to perform a physical examination remotely with the 
assistance  of  a  clinic  employee.    In  addition  to  dealing  with  physical  ailments,  the  VA  can 
provide  mental  health  (Telemental  Health)  and  substance  abuse  counseling  via  video  in 
appropriate  circumstances.    This  type  of  communication  may  not  be  appropriate  for  some 
veterans,  particularly  if  they  have  mental  health  issues  which  would  be  exacerbated  by  a 

  V

  E

  H

  A

67 
 

perception that someone on the “television” is talking to them, monitoring them, etc.  According 
to the VA, Telehealth services are available at all of Tennessee’s VA clinics other than the clinic 
in Roane County.  According to the VA, the Roane County clinic is closing temporarily.   

lthough  a  home-based  video  conferencing  service  is  not  currently  available,  the  VA  is 
conducting a pilot project and is hoping to provide home-based, secure/encrypted video services 
in the future.  To access this service, which is referred to as Clinical Video Telehealth to Home, 
veterans  would  be  required  to  have  access  to  a  computer,  webcam,  high-speed  internet,  and 
speakers.  The VA does  not anticipate reimbursing veterans for the costs  associated with those 
items, but the VA may, at some point, provide veterans with a device which will allow a veteran 
to  communicate  with  the  VA  if  the  veteran  does  not  own  a  computer  or  the  other  required 
devices.  In addition to the obvious convenience such a service would provide, this home-based 
service  might  be  favored  by  veterans  who  require  mental  health  services  but,  due  to  the 
perceived stigma  attached  to receiving those services, do not wish to be  seen at a VA  medical 
center  or  clinic.    Clinical  Video  Telehealth  to  Home  also  may  be  a  more  attractive  option  for 
veterans who, for example, are uncomfortable driving long distances or driving over bridges due 
to stressors associated with their military service. 

s with other VA services, resources are limited.  Therefore, courts cannot rely exclusively on 
the  Telehealth  Program  for  mental  health/medical/substance  abuse  services.    Courts  should 
consult with their local VA clinics regarding available resources and accessibility.  Courts also 
can consult the Telehealth website (http://www.telehealth.va.gov/) for additional information. 

n addition to these services, the VA offers the PTSD Coach mobile application, which is not a 
substitute  for  professional  treatment  but  can  help  veterans  “learn  about  and  manage  symptoms 
that commonly occur after trauma.”  For more information or to download the app, see the VA’s 
website at http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/pages/ptsdcoach.asp.    

inally, the VA offers online healthcare services through the My HealtheVet  program.  Courts 

can consult the website at https://www.myhealth.va.gov/index.html for additional information. 
     
 

Vet Centers and Non-VA Treatment of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Issues 

eterans who have mental health issues may prefer to be treated by community-based providers 
or at a Vet Center as opposed to utilizing a VA medical center or clinic.  Some veterans simply 
do not trust the VA.  Other veterans may avoid the VA due to the perceived stigma associated 
with seeking help or due to confidentiality issues.  With regard to the latter, persons who have 
mental health and/or substance abuse issues would prefer that that information not be included in 
their permanent military records.  

et  Centers  provide  services  to  war  zone  veterans  and  their  families.    According  to  the  Vet 
Center  website  (www.vetcenter.va.gov/index.asp),  which  provides  a  great  deal  of  information 
regarding eligibility and available resources, the “goal of the Vet Center program is to provide a 
broad  range  of  counseling,  outreach,  and  referral  services  to  eligible  veterans  in  order  to  help 
them  make  a  satisfying  post-war  readjustment  to  civilian  life.”    Based  upon  the  AOC’s

veterans did not feel comfortable accessing services through the VA’s medical centers and, as a 
result, were not seeking needed counseling.  The Vet Centers, which are less formal than other 
VHA facilities and are staffed primarily by combat veterans, including licensed therapists, were 
created as a result.  Although the Vet Centers, which were initially independent, now fall under 
the auspices of the VA, the centers do not share their clients’ records with the VA. 

ar zone experience typically is a requirement for receiving services from a Vet Center, but the 
AOC contacted a Vet Center for clarification, and the representative stated that Vet Centers will 
provide  treatment  for  a  victim  of  MST  regardless  of  whether  the  veteran  has  war  zone 
experience.   Moreover,  even if a  veteran does not have war zone  experience, Vet Centers will 
often  provide  short-duration  treatment  and  assist  the  veteran  with  a  referral  to  an  appropriate 
treatment provider.   

he VA also has Mobile Vet Centers (http://www.va.gov/health/NewsFeatures/20120117a.asp).  
The  AOC  initially  was  told  that  the  mobile  units  travel  the  state  and  offer  mental  health 
counseling, and the VA’s website appears to support that concept.  However, the AOC contacted 
individuals  who  work  directly  with  this  program  and  learned  that  the  program  is  much  more 
limited.   In  Tennessee, the Mobile  Vet Centers are based in Memphis, Nashville,  and Johnson 
City.  The Vet Centers take these mobile units to events veterans are likely to attend (Operation 
Stand  Down  events,  parades,  etc.).    The  units  serve  in  an  outreach  capacity,  informing  the 
eligible veterans of the services they can receive at a Vet Center and providing them with contact 
information  for  the  Vet  Center.    If  someone  is  having  a  mental  health  crisis  at  one  of  those 
events, the Vet Center representative will talk briefly with that person.  However, Vet Centers do 
not provide extensive counseling at these events, and they do not plan to use the mobile units to 
provide  statewide  mental  health  counseling  in  the  future.   They  merely  are  connecting  eligible 
veterans with Vet Centers for counseling.  

eterans Benefits Administration  

he VA’s Organizational Briefing Book summarizes the VBA’s role as follows: 

The  [VBA]  is  responsible  for  administering  the  Department’s  programs  that 
provide financial and other forms of assistance to Veterans, their dependents, and 
survivors.    Major  benefits  include  Veterans’  compensation,  Veterans’  pension, 
survivors’  benefits, 
rehabilitation  and  employment  assistance,  education 
assistance, home loan guaranties, and life insurance coverage. 

nlike VHA benefits, which do not require a service-connected condition or a disability rating, 
some  VBA  benefits,  such  as  monthly  disability  payments,  require  that  the  condition  at  issue 
relate to an event which occurred during the person’s military service.  The injury/disorder will 
be  rated  0%-100%,  and  any  approved  monetary  benefits  will  be  tax-free.    A  veteran  who 
qualifies  for  VA  disability  compensation  also  may  be  given  priority  for  non-monetary  VA 
benefits.

In  addition  to  addressing  a  veteran’s  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  issues,  a  VTC  will 
attempt to address housing, education, employment, and other issues which, absent intervention, 
could hinder a veteran’s ability  to  succeed.  Educational  benefits are particularly important for 
veterans because many of them enlisted immediately after graduating from high school.   

f a county does not have a VTC or if a veteran is not eligible to participate in such a court, the 
veteran  may  still  be  eligible  for  the  tax-free  disability  compensation  or  many  non-monetary 
benefits  through  the  VBA.    For  offenders  who  qualify  for  services,  the  VBA  is  an  excellent 
resource.  VTC team members and/or defense attorneys (who may be representing veterans who 
aren’t  participating  in  a  VTC)  should  attempt  to  familiarize  themselves  with  available  VBA 
benefits.  Although there are many resources and websites which discuss these benefits, the VA’s 
2012 Benefits Booklet (www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book.asp) provides a particularly 
helpful general overview of those benefits.  There also are many websites which address various 
issues  such  as  education  (http://www.gibill.va.gov/benefits/index.html),  and  these  websites  can 
  Government  websites 
be  accessed  through  the  VA’s  general  website  (www.va.gov). 
www.vetsuccess.gov  and  www.cwt.va.gov  are  helpful  for  employment-related  issues,  with  the 
latter  focusing  on  the  VA’s  Compensated  Work  Therapy  program,  which  assists  with 
reintegration  into  the  workforce  following  homelessness.    There  also  are  non-governmental 
entities  which  assist  with  employment  issues.    For  example,  the  Helmets  to  Hardhats  program 
(http://helmetstohardhats.org/)  assists  veterans  (including  National  Guard  and  Reserves)  in 
transitioning from military service to a career in construction. 

he  AOC  has  heard  from  multiple  sources  that  acquiring  VBA  benefits,  particularly  if  the 
veteran is seeking disability compensation, can be a lengthy, time-consuming process.  Veterans 
can receive  assistance  at no cost from Veterans  Benefits Representatives (employed  by TDVA 
and located in TDVA’s Field Offices), County Veterans Service Officers, the Veterans Benefits 
Office at the VA’s Regional Office in Nashville, or any of the groups listed on the second page 
of  VA  Form  21-22  (http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22-ARE.pdf),  which  a  veteran 
must  submit  to  the  VA  before  a  listed  service  organization  will  be  permitted  to  act  on  the 
veteran’s behalf.  Veterans also can appoint an individual to act as his benefits representative by 
utilizing VA Form 21-22a (http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22A-ARE.pdf).

he AOC does not anticipate that the NCA will have a significant role in a VTC.  Therefore, the 
AOC will not discuss it in this report.  However, individuals who wish to learn more about the 
NCA can consult its website at www.cem.va.gov/.  

VETERANS’ JUSTICE OUTREACH SPECIALISTS 

he  VA’s  website  (www.va.gov/HOMELESS/VJO.asp)  summarizes  the  Veteran  Justice 

Outreach Initiative, which began in 2009, as follows: 
 

The purpose of the Veteran Justice Outreach Initiative is to avoid the unnecessary 
criminalization  of  mental  illness  and  extended  incarceration  among  Veterans  by 
ensuring  that  eligible  justice-involved  Veterans  have  timely  access  to  VHA 
mental health and substance use services when clinically indicated, and other VA 
services and benefits as appropriate. 

VA is requiring justice-focused activity at the medical center level. VA Medical 
Centers have been strongly encouraged to develop working relationships with the 
court system and local law enforcement and must now provide outreach to justice-
involved Veterans in the communities they serve. 

Each  VA  medical  center  has  been  asked  to  designate  a  facility-based  Veterans' 
Justice Outreach Specialist, responsible for direct outreach, assessment, and case 
management  for  justice-involved  Veterans  in  local  courts  and  jails,  and  liaison 
with local justice system partners. 

The AOC spoke with the  VA’s General Counsel and  the National Coordinator  for the  Veteran 
Justice Outreach Initiative, both of whom made presentations at a national conference attended 
by the AOC.  They stressed that the VA is committed to ending homelessness among veterans, 
and  that  since  many  people  who  are  charged  with  criminal  offenses  subsequently  become 
homeless, they believe that intervening on behalf of justice-involved veterans is crucial to their 
mission.  Veterans are a relatively small percentage of the U.S. population, but they are a large 
percentage of the homeless population.   

ennessee has a total of three Veterans’ Justice Outreach Specialists (“VJO”), and because they 
are attached to  the VA’s  medical  centers, they  are based in Nashville, Memphis  and Mountain 
Home.  The AOC spoke at length with Tennessee’s VJOs as well as numerous VJOs from other 
states.    The  AOC  found  the  VJOs  to  be  very  knowledgeable  regarding  the  available  resources 
and very motivated to assist veterans in any way possible.   

he VJOs work with regular courts, problem-solving courts, jails, and law enforcement officials.  
Some courts/jails assist the VJOs by notifying them when a veteran or service member has been 
arrested.  Upon receiving this notification, the VJO meets with the arrestee to determine if he has 
enrolled with the VA for the purpose of receiving benefits.  If the arrestee has not enrolled or is 
unsure if he has enrolled, the VJO will assist the arrestee in completing the required paperwork 
and,  thereafter,  in  accessing  the  services  to  which  a  qualified  arrestee  is  entitled.    Unlike  the 

  T

majority of the state, local, and non-governmental veterans’ groups, which tend to focus on VBA 
benefits, the VJOs focus primarily on VHA benefits, and they are capable of assisting courts in 
identifying available VA resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment.     

hile the AOC applauds the enthusiasm of the VJOs, who clearly are dedicated to the veterans 
they serve, it is important for the legislature and the courts to recognize that Tennessee’s VJOs 
have many responsibilities throughout VISN 9 (which includes states other than Tennessee), that 
there are only three VJOs in  Tennessee, that there are 95  counties  in Tennessee, and that each 
county has multiple courts.  Therefore, it will not be possible for the VJOs to be present in each 
VTC.    Representative  John  Ragan,  who  sponsored  the  legislation  which  directed  the  AOC  to 
conduct this study, met with the AOC regarding his expectations.  During that meeting, he asked 
the  AOC  to  make  recommendations  regarding  federal  resources  which  would  be  helpful  in 
assisting justice-involved veterans.  As the AOC stated in the interim report it submitted to the 
legislature  regarding  VTCs,  the  AOC  believes  that  additional  VJOs  are  needed  in  Tennessee.  
This is a nationwide problem, though, and the VA has many other responsibilities, so the AOC 
recognizes that even with additional federal funding the VA will be unable to provide every state 
with an adequate number of VJOs. 

lthough the VJOs will be unable to attend every court session in person, the VJOs will be an 
excellent  resource  for  the  courts,  and  the  AOC  encourages  courts  to  include  the  VJOs  in  the 
initial discussions regarding both procedural and substantive issues for justice-involved veterans.  
Courts  and  attorneys  must  be  patient,  however,  because  the  VJOs  quickly  will  become 
overwhelmed by the number of requests for assistance as the drawdown continues and there is, 
as anticipated, a significant increase in the number of arrests involving veterans.      

INCARCERATED AND HOMELESS VETERANS 

he VHA is precluded from providing hospital or outpatient care to a veteran who is a patient or 
inmate of another government agency if that agency has a duty to provide the care/services.  This 
includes  jails  and  prisons,  but  the  prohibition  does  not  apply  if  the  inmate  is  released  into  a 
temporary  housing  program  such  as  a  halfway  house.    38  C.F.R.  §  17.38(c)(5).    Moreover,  a 
representative  from  the  VA  can  meet  with  an  incarcerated  veteran  to  assist  the  veteran  in 
enrolling for benefits for which the veteran will be eligible upon release.  Likewise, the VA will 
perform  a  clinical  assessment  of  an  incarcerated  veteran  even  though  it  will  not  provide  the 
recommended treatment until the veteran has been released.   

epending upon the nature of the conviction (felony vs. misdemeanor), a veteran could become 
ineligible  for  certain  VBA  benefits,  including  disability  and  pension  compensation,  on  the  61st 
day  of  incarceration.    For  more  information  regarding  the  parameters  of  these  rules,  see 
http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Benefits/Incarcerated/benprogfact.htm.    A  veteran’s  family  may 
be  eligible  to  receive  compensation  from  the  VA  even  if  the  incarcerated  veteran  becomes 
ineligible to receive compensation.  A VA representative can assist inmates in determining the 
family’s eligibility, if any, for VBA benefits.

There also are various VA benefits available to homeless veterans, and a VA representative, if 
located reasonably close to the facility at issue, may be willing to meet with a homeless veteran 
to assist the inmate in completing the necessary paperwork to access housing benefits (including 
transitional housing, when applicable) and related services, including screens for substance abuse 
and mental health issues.  The VA representative also can assist the veteran in creating a plan for 
how to proceed following the veteran’s release from incarceration.   

he homeless services assessment form is referred to as the Homeless Operations Management 
and Evaluation System (HOMES) form.  Homeless veterans (according to the VA’s definition of 
“homeless”)  who  receive  an  honorable  discharge  or  a  general  discharge  under  honorable 
conditions are eligible for benefits through the VA’s homeless program.  Veterans who receive 
an other than honorable or bad conduct discharge are eligible for transitional housing and limited 
dental  benefits  but  are  not  eligible  for  other  services.    Veterans  who  receive  a  dishonorable 
discharge are not eligible for any services through the VA’s homeless program.   

or general information regarding benefit eligibility for incarcerated veterans and veterans who 
are  on  fugitive  status,  see  http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Benefits/Incarcerated/index.htm.    For

Tennessee  Department  of  Correction  also  has  a  program  which  assists  veterans  who  are  being 
released from incarceration.  That program is discussed elsewhere in this report.     
  
 

MISCELLANEOUS STATE, FEDERAL AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES 

lthough  a  basic  internet  search  will  identify  countless  resources  for  veterans  and  service 
members and the AOC encourages interested persons to conduct their own searches, VTCs also 
should consider utilizing the resources listed below.  

ennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development 

he  Tennessee  Department  of  Labor  and  Workforce  Development  (“TDLWD”)  has  special 
programs  for  veterans  who  are  seeking  employment.    Information  regarding  both  state  and 
federal  programs  can  be  found  on  TDLWD’s  website  at  http://www.state.tn.us/labor-
wfd/veterans.shtml. The website also has a link which provides contact information for the local 
career centers which are staffed by TDLWD.  TDVA representatives are located in some of those 
centers.  As with other benefits, courts should be aware that the definition of “veteran” for the 
purpose of qualifying for assistance through TDLWD and the United States Department of Labor 
will vary depending upon the type of benefit which is being sought.    

ursuant  to  the  Tennessee  Excellence,  Accountability,  and  Management  ("T.E.A.M.")  Act  of 
2012, veterans are given special consideration with regard to hiring and layoffs.  See T.C.A. §§ 
8-30-307, -314.

Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services 

he  Tennessee  Department  of  Mental  Health  and  Substance  Abuse  Services  (“DMH”)  has  the 
following  funding  sources  for  drug/alcohol  treatment:    (1)  ADAT9  DUI  –  source  is  a  DUI 
offender  fee;  (2)  ADAT  SPOT10
  –  source  is  a  drug  offender  fee;  (3)  Community  Treatment 
Collaborative (“CTC”) – source is TDOC/TDOCPP; and (4) Federal block grants.  Moreover, in 
2012, Governor Bill Haslam issued Executive Order No. 12, which transferred Tennessee’s Drug 
Courts Program from the Department of Finance and Administration’s Office of Criminal Justice 
Programs (“OCJP”) to DMH.  Therefore, DMH will now be receiving the drug treatment court 
funds  which  were  previously  received  by  OCJP  in  addition  to  receiving  the  ADAT,  CTC,  and 
federal funds.   
 
The majority of the ADAT funds and the federal funds are directed to treatment services through 
drug  treatment  courts  and  mental  health  treatment  courts,  and  the  recipients  of  those  services 
must  be  indigent  offenders  or  offenders  who  have  insurance  or  TennCare  but  who  have 
exhausted their benefits and meet federal poverty guidelines.  Under limited circumstances, the 
funds also can be used to treat an offender if the offender’s insurance declines to pre-certify the 
offender for treatment.  The CTC funds are for offenders who are at high risk for reoffending due 
to alcohol/drug use and for offenders whose probation/parole would otherwise be revoked due to 
a technical violation. 

ccording  to  DMH,  there  currently  are  55  treatment  providers  in  Tennessee.    Some  of  these 
providers  offer  inpatient  treatment,  and  some  offer  outpatient  treatment.    Two  providers  offer 
only  drug/alcohol  treatment.    All  55  are  co-occurring  capable  or  have  the  ability  to  refer 
individuals to a provider who is co-occurring capable.  Tennessee’s judges and problem-solving 
court staff members feel strongly that Tennessee does not have an adequate number of treatment 
facilities  to  provide  drug,  alcohol,  and  mental  health  services  to  indigent  and  non-indigent 
offenders  who  require  such  services.    Judges  who  wish  to  learn  more  about  the  available 
treatment resources can  contact  Ellen Abbott, DMH’s Director of Criminal Justice Services, at 
(615) 253-7837 or Ellen.L.Abbott@tn.gov.    

ennessee Department of Correction 

ecause the Tennessee Department of Correction (“TDOC”) believes that it is less expensive to 
treat offenders than to incarcerate them and also because TDOC believes that addressing mental 
health and substance abuse issues will result in a lower recidivism rate, TDOC favors treatment 
over incarceration for all appropriate offenders.  If an offender is incarcerated, TDOC provides 
as much treatment as its limited resources will allow.  Although TDOC provides this service to 
all offenders regardless of whether they are veterans, TDOC has some services and procedures 
which apply specifically to veterans.  

uring  the  intake  process,  which  takes  approximately  one  month,  inmates  are  given  the 
opportunity to identify themselves as veterans.  TDOC then provides TDVA with the names of 
those  prisoners,  and  TDVA  confirms  their  status.    A  TDVA  representative  also  goes  to  the

facility to discuss benefits with veterans.  As previously noted, the VA will not provide benefits 
to  an  inmate  during  the  period  of  incarceration,  but  the  VA  will,  when  appropriate,  provide 
benefits  to  the  inmate’s  family.    The  VA  also  has  reentry  specialists  who  assist  incarcerated 
veterans as they approach their release dates. 

inally, TDOC attempts to assist prisoners during the reentry process via the Tennessee Reentry 

Collaborative (“TREC”).  TREC will be discussed in more detail below.   

ennessee Board of Probation and Parole 

he  supervision  services  section  of  the  Tennessee  Board  of  Probation  and  Parole  merged  with 
TDOC in 2012.  The Board of Parole remains an independent entity, but community-based state 
probation and parole  services are  now  provided  through  TDOC.    That section  is referred to as 
TDOC  Probation  and  Parole.  The  AOC  met  with  representatives  from  TDOC  and  BOPP 
separately  prior  to  the  merger  and  continued  to  communicate  with  them  following  the  merger.   
For  the  sake  of  convenience,  the  AOC  will  refer  to  the  new  supervision  section  of  TDOC  as 
TDOCPP in this report.  

DOCPP  primarily  supervises  persons  who  have  been  convicted  of  felonies.11
    Occasionally, 
TDOCPP  also  supervises  someone  who  is  charged  with  a  felony,  is  bound  over  to  the 
circuit/criminal  court  by  the  grand  jury,  and  subsequently  enters  a  plea  to  a  misdemeanor.  
Similarly, if someone who has been convicted of a felony and is being supervised by TDOCPP is 
subsequently  convicted  of  a  misdemeanor,  TDOCPP  may  continue  to  supervise  that  offender.   
TDOCPP  will  supervise  persons  who  are  granted  judicial  diversion  if  the  offense  at  issue  is  a 
felony, but it does not have the authority to supervise persons who are granted pretrial diversion.   
 
TDOCPP  only  services  circuit  courts  and  criminal  courts,  and  its  probation  officers  are  not 
available  at  the  general  sessions  court  level.    Because  early  identification  and  intervention  are 
critical to the success of a VTC court and the majority of criminal cases are initially heard at the 
general sessions court level, TDOCPP officers likely will not be involved in the veteran/service 
member  identification  process.    However,  those  officers  are  familiar  with  available  treatment 
resources  and  other  relevant  community  resources,  so  courts  may  wish  to  consult  with  them 
when establishing a VTC or other problem-solving court.   

s previously noted, a member of the VTC team should conduct periodic home visits to provide 
offenders  with  support  and  also  to  confirm  that  offenders  are  complying  with  the  VTC’s 
requirements.   For some  courts,  a law  enforcement officer  might perform that function.   If the 
VTC  is  a  circuit/criminal  level  court  as  opposed  to  a  general  sessions  level  court  and  if  the 
offender  at  issue  qualifies  for  TDOCPP  services  due  to  the  nature  of  the  disposition,  the 
presiding  judge  may  wish  to  consult  with  TDOCPP  regarding  the  possibility  that  a  state 
probation  officer  could  conduct  home  visits.    Like  other  state  agencies,  though,  TDOCPP  has 
very  limited  resources.    Moreover,  pursuant  to  TDOCPP  policy,  the  frequency  of  home  visits 
varies depending upon the nature of the offense at issue.  Some offenders do not receive home 
visits, while others receive one visit per year.  Sex offenders receive frequent home visits.   
                                                 
11 Although TDOCPP previously was the only entity which was authorized to supervise felons, 2012 Public Chapter 
652 authorizes private probation companies to supervise Class E felons under certain listed circumstances.

Offenders who are supervised by TDOCPP are asked if they are veterans, but TDOCPP neither 
confirms the accuracy of the response nor offers veteran-specific services.  However, it performs 
a risk assessment on all offenders in the same way  that VTCs will be  assessing potential VTC 
participants to determine whether they are high-risk, high-need offenders.  TDOCPP utilizes the 
Level  of  Service  Case  Management  Inventory  (“LS/CMI”)  as  well  as  the  Addiction  Severity 
Index (“ASI”), and/or the American Society of Addiction Medicine (“ASAM”) assessment tools 
through  DMH  to  assess  an  offender’s  needs  if  he  potentially  has  a  substance  abuse  problem.  
TDOCPP  then  tailors  its  services  to  address  those  needs.    Depending  upon  the  severity  of  the 
addiction,  for  example,  an  offender  might  require  inpatient  treatment,  outpatient  treatment, 
relapse  prevention  classes,  or  a  combination  thereof.    TDOCPP  contracts  with  DMH  for  some 
screening and treatment purposes, but the funding is limited in large part to addressing substance 
abuse  issues  as  opposed  to  mental  health  issues.    TDOCPP  also  contracts  with  the  Tennessee 
Community  Corrections  Association 
(http://www.tncommunitycorrections.org/index.html), 
which  has  residential  programs  in  Kingsport  and  Memphis.    However,  those  programs  focus 
primarily on developing life skills as opposed to offering treatment for substance abuse or mental 
health issues.  

onsistent  with  the  recommendations  of  participants  and  presenters  at  the  VTC  trainings 
attended  by  the  AOC,  TDOCPP  recommends  that  judges  refrain  from  attempting  to  diagnose 
and/or to determine the appropriate course of treatment for offenders.  Instead, judges should rely 
upon qualified personnel to conduct a screening/assessment to determine what, if any, treatment 
is appropriate for a particular offender.  The court’s order could simply refer to the appropriate 
assessment entity and order “treatment as assessed by” that entity.   

 presentence report, which will include the results of the risk assessment, typically is completed 
following an adjudication of guilt but prior to sentencing.  However, Tennessee Code Annotated 
section  40-35-205(b)  authorizes  a  court,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  defendant,  to  direct  a 
presentence  service  officer  to  begin  the  investigation  prior  to  adjudication.    The  information 
which is gathered is confidential and will only be shared with the court, prosecutor and/or jury 
prior  to  a  finding  (or  plea)  of  guilt  if  the  disclosure  is  authorized  by  the  defendant.    TDOCPP 
suggests that courts may wish to consider utilizing the provision more frequently, particularly if 
a  VTC  or  other  problem-solving  court  is  a  pre-adjudication  court.    For  the  information  to  be 
properly utilized to determine an offender’s eligibility for a problem-solving court, the offender 
would be required to agree to its disclosure. 

ennessee Reentry Collaborative  

noxville  created  an  inmate  reentry  program  in  the  1990’s,  and  the  program  reduced  the 
recidivism rate by 40%.  The statewide Tennessee Reentry Collaborative (“TREC”) was created 
in  2004,  and  it  is  co-sponsored  by  TDOC  and  the  Board  of  Parole.    TREC’s  mission  is  “to 
provide a continuum of services for all offenders reentering society in order to reduce recidivism

located 

lthough TREC is a statewide program, there are nine local TRECs within that program.  Those 
in  Johnson  City,  Tullahoma,  Knoxville,  Chattanooga,  Nashville, 
TRECs  are 
Murfreesboro,  Jackson,  Memphis,  and  Clarksville.    Hamblen  County  currently  is  considering 
creating a TREC.  The local TRECs focus on such services as housing, education, employment, 
transportation,  veterans’  services,  medical  treatment,  mental  health  treatment,  and  drug  abuse 
treatment.  For  example,  as  previously  noted,  the  Appalachian  Regional  Coalition  on 
Homelessness (“ARCH”), which is based in Johnson City but serves eight counties, received a 
grant to provide housing and support services for qualified veterans and their families.  ARCH 
works with Johnson City’s TREC, so judges in East Tennessee may wish to contact the Johnson 
City TREC for additional information.   

RECs focus on individuals who are being released from incarceration.  In contrast, Tennessee’s 
problem-solving courts, including VTCs, focus on individuals who are receiving treatment and 
are not currently incarcerated.  However, the participants in both groups must address many of 
the same issues if they intend to become productive, law-abiding citizens.  Therefore, the AOC 
encourages  courts  to  contact  the  TRECs  to  request  information  regarding  the  available 
community resources.  The AOC possesses contact information for each of the local TRECs, and 
the AOC will forward it to interested persons upon request. 

ennessee Criminal Justice Coordinating Council        

      
The Criminal Justice Coordinating Council (“CJCC”) was initially created via executive order by 
Governor Phil Bredesen and was legislatively created in 2010.  There are 19 members, including 
a juvenile court judge and a criminal court judge.  T.C.A. § 41-52-102.  CJCC “is charged with 
collaborating  with  and  coordinating  the  services  of  state  and  local  governmental  agencies  and 
non-governmental entities in the criminal justice system to increase public safety.  In performing 
these  duties,  the  council  shall  conduct  planning,  research  and  evaluation  activities  to  improve 
criminal justice system operations and coordination.”  T.C.A. § 41-52-103.  Lee Ragsdale is the 
Executive Director of CJCC, and he can be reached at  Lee.Ragsdale@tn.gov or 615-532-7368.  
Mr.  Ragsdale  has  a  great  deal  of  institutional  knowledge  and  is  willing  to  assist  Tennessee’s 
courts.    CJCC  serves  TREC  in  an  administrative  capacity,  so  Mr.  Ragsdale  is  well-informed 
regarding both TREC and CJCC.

DVA  is  a  relatively  small  department  which  has  approximately  100  employees.    It  services 
500,000 veterans and 1.5 million dependents and survivors.  TDVA’s primary role is to keep the 
public informed regarding veterans’ contributions and needs, to provide cemetery services, and 
to  assist  veterans  in  filing  claims  and  obtaining  benefits  through  the  VBA  (pension,  disability, 
loans, housing, education, etc.).  TDVA’s benefits assistance function is performed primarily by 
its  Veterans  Benefit  Representatives,  who  are  located  in  TDVA’s  field  offices  throughout 
Tennessee.   

n addition to interacting with veterans through  its main office in Nashville  as  well  as its field 
offices,  TDVA  conducts  and/or  participates  in  outreach  programs  across  the  state.    Many 
governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations also participate in these events in an 
effort to assist veterans with accessing available resources. 

ther  than  serving  as  an  advocate  for  a  veteran  who  feels  he  has  been  mistreated  at  a  VA 
medical center, for example, the TDVA does not have a role in VHA issues (medical treatment, 
substance  abuse  treatment,  mental  health  treatment,  etc.)  and  does  not  anticipate  possessing 
adequate resources to assist courts with those issues.  However, TDVA’s benefit representatives 
will be available to assist courts in interpreting VA Form DD-214 when necessary.     

n addition to assisting veterans directly, TDVA conducts training for County Veterans Service 
Officers.  These officers are selected by local officials and are not employed by TDVA.  Each 
officer is listed by county at www.tnvso.com/id16.html.  Many of the officers are veterans, and 
the majority of them work on a part-time basis.  Some of them are paid  for their services, and 
others serve in a volunteer capacity.  The officers’ available time and resources vary by county.  
The officers serve  as  advocates  for veterans, and they  assist with such things  as  accessing  VA 
benefits and pursuing discharge upgrades.     
  
TDVA’s  website  (http://www.state.tn.us/veteran/)  has  links  to  information  regarding  state  and 
federal benefits for veterans. 

overnor’s Council for Armed Forces, Veterans, and Their Families 

n  August  31,  2010,  Governor  Phil  Bredesen  established  the  Governor’s  Council  on  Service 
Members, Veterans and Their Families via Executive Order No. 71.  The Council subsequently 
became  inactive  and,  on  July  23,  2012,  Governor  Bill  Haslam  reconstituted  it  via  Executive 
Order  No.  15  as  the  Governor’s  Council  for  Armed  Forces,  Veterans,  and  Their  Families 
(“Council”).    The  Council  is  administratively  attached  to  the  TDVA  and  is  composed  of  10 
citizen members and seven ex officio members.  The qualifications for the citizen members are 
listed  in  the  executive  order,  and  the  ex  officio  members  represent  the  TDVA,  Military 
Department, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, Department of Health, 
Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Senate, and House of Representatives.  The 
executive  order  reflects  that  the  Council  “is  charged  with  facilitating  collaboration  and 
coordination  within  the  system  of  care  to  effectively  and  responsively  meet  the  needs  of  the 
members  of  the  armed  forces,  veterans  and  their  families.”    The  AOC  is  hopeful  that  the

involved veterans and service members.       

ffice of the Judge Advocate General 

he  Office  of  the  Judge  Advocate  General  (“JAG”)  provides  active  duty  service  members, 
retirees, and their dependents with free legal assistance.  For example, a JAG officer may assist a 
veteran,  service  member  or  dependent  in  drafting  a  will,  obtaining  benefits,  or  resolving 
landlord/tenant disputes.  JAGs will not make an appearance on behalf of military personnel or 
act  as  legal  counsel  in  any  civilian  court.    However,  JAG  offices  in  the  National  Guard  and 
Reserves as well as on active military bases are available for meetings in person or via telephone.  
The  JAG  attorney  will  provide  legal  assistance  to  help  resolve  the  pending  issue.    If  the  issue 
requires direct legal representation, JAG offices typically are aware of attorneys who are willing 
to assist veterans in civil and criminal matters in state and federal courts.  Those services will not 
be free unless the  attorney  offers  to work  pro bono, but  JAG  will  often provide referrals upon 
request.

the  only  national  DAV  office  which  is  located  in  Tennessee,  there  are  many  DAV  members 
located  throughout  the  state.    Those  members  likely  would  be  willing  to  serve  as  mentors  for 
justice-involved veterans and also may be interested in assisting with the filing and processing of 
claims  for  benefits.    Also,  the  DAV  is  known  for  assisting  veterans  with  transportation  issues.   
Therefore,  courts  may  wish  to  collaborate  with  the  DAV  if  justice-involved  veterans  lack 
personal transportation for mental health, substance abuse and/or court appointments.

aid  societies,  and  law  schools  regarding  any  pro  bono  services  which  may  be  available  to 
veterans  and  service  members.    Local  resources  (although  not  necessarily  veteran-specific

olicy Research Associates, Inc. 

he AOC contacted a Policy Research Associates, Inc. (“PRA”) representative and found him to 
be very helpful and well-informed.  PRA operates SAMHSA’s Service Members, Veterans, and 
Their  Families  Technical  Assistance  Center  (“SMVF  Center”)  as  well  as  SAMHSA’s  GAINS 
Center for Behavioral Health and Justice Transformation (“GAINS Center”).  

RA  is  available  to  provide  technical  support  via  email  or  telephone  at  no  cost.    In-person 
technical  support  typically  is  conditioned  upon  receipt  of  a  grant  which  includes  that  type  of 
support, but in-person support is available to all states for a fee.   

ecause it is a past policy academy state, Tennessee is eligible for technical assistance through 
the  SMVF  Center.    The  available  support  includes  phone  consultation  and/or  a  site  visit.   
Wendell  Cheek,  Deputy  Commissioner  at  the  Tennessee  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  is 
Tennessee’s contact for the purpose of requesting technical support from the SMVF Center. 

RA  also  offers  information  and  training  regarding  the  Sequential  Intercept  Model,  which 
“provides  a  conceptual  framework  for  communities  to  use  when  considering  the  interface 
between  the  criminal  justice  and  mental  health  systems  as  they  address  concerns  about 
criminalization of  people  with  mental illness.”  The AOC  possesses information regarding this 
model and will forward it to interested persons upon request.  According to PRA, there will be a

National Coalition of Homeless Veterans 

  state  agency  the  AOC  met  with  regarding  VTC  issues  mentioned  the  National  Coalition  of 
Homeless  Veterans  (“NCHV”)  as  a  reputable  resource  for  VTCs.    NCHV  has  a  great  deal  of 
information on its website (www.nchv.org).  According to that website, NCHV is, among other 
things: 
 

the resource and technical assistance center for a national network of community-
based  service  providers  and  local,  state  and  federal  agencies  that  provide 
emergency  and  supportive  housing,  food,  health  services,  job  training  and 
placement  assistance,  legal  aid  and  case  management  support  for  hundreds  of 
thousands of homeless veterans each year. 

peration Stand Down 

eriodically,  there  are  Operation  Stand  Down  events  throughout  the  country,  including  in 
Tennessee.  In 2011, there were 175 such events in the United States, and Tennessee hosted them 
in Memphis, Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Nashville.  State and federal agencies as well as other 
governmental and non-governmental entities which offer services to veterans set up booths at the 
event  and  educate  veterans  regarding  the  available  benefits/services.    These  “vendors”  often 
include judges and lawyers who assist veterans who have pending criminal charges.  The AOC 
spoke with lawyers, judges, and other participants, and all participants spoke very highly of the 
event.   

he  Nashville  event,  which  is  a  three-day  event  with  approximately  130  participant 
organizations/individuals, is organized by a permanent, stand-alone entity called Operation Stand 
Down Nashville, Inc. (“OSDN”), whose website (http://osdnashville.org/) summarizes its overall 
role as follows:  
 

Operation Stand Down Nashville,  Inc (OSDN) is the primary nonprofit resource 
for  veterans  in  Middle  Tennessee  providing  life  changing  social  services 
including  transitional  housing,  or  referrals,  employment  readiness  training  and 
placement  assistance,  and  coordination  of  the  activities  of  other  agencies  in  the 
delivery  of  such  services.  We  are  the  only  VA  approved  and  supported  Veteran 
Service Center in Tennessee. Our clients are honorably discharged veterans12
 with 
an emphasis on veterans who are homeless. Our ultimate goal is to give veterans 
in need the tools to rejoin their community as productive, responsible citizens. 

 
The AOC toured OSDN’s facility and met with the executive director as well as multiple staff 
members, and the AOC found them to be fully committed to their mission and willing to provide 
assistance  to  the  courts  or  to  any  other  entity  which  is  interested  in  helping  veterans.    OSDN 
offers  a  wide  range  of  services  to  veterans,  and  the  AOC  possesses  a  significant  amount  of

a discharge which falls within one of the following two categories: (1) Honorable; or (2) General Under Honorable 
Conditions.

ational Alliance on Mental Illness (http://www.namitn.org/)  

he  Tennessee  Chapter  of  the  National  Alliance  of  Mental  Illness  (“NAMI”)  expressed  a 
willingness  to  assist  courts  which  are  dealing  with  offenders  who  have  mental  health  issues.  
NAMI’s website includes a map (http://www.namitn.org/affiliates.htm) which identifies the local 
affiliates  by  county.    A  county  which  does  not  have  an  affiliate  listed  may  be  covered  by  an 
affiliate from a neighboring county.   

AMI is not a treatment provider, and its members do not offer treatment at no cost.  Instead, 
NAMI  offers  technical  assistance  and  referrals  to  treatment  providers  and  to  entities  which 
provide other types of assistance to persons who have mental health issues.         

AMI  also  noted  that  the  Rural  Health  Association  of  Tennessee  (“RHAT”)  is  interested  in 
assisting  courts.    Although  RHAT  has  approximately  800  members,  it  is  a  relatively  small 
organization with one full-time staff member.  For additional information, see RHAT’s website

olleges and Universities 

olleges and universities often have special services and educational opportunities for veterans.  
They may offer counseling to veterans and have administrative offices which cater to veterans.  
As  with  all  other  veteran-specific  offers,  though,  veterans  should  be  aware  that  some 
establishments target veterans due to their available VA resources and that these establishments 
aren’t always acting in the best interest of the veterans. 

oaching Into Care 

oaching Into Care is a free and confidential VA service which assists friends and families who 
believe a loved one may need mental health treatment.  The “coach” will give the caller guidance 
regarding the most effective manner of speaking with the veteran about the caller’s concerns and 
also will assist the caller in understanding what VA resources are available to the veteran.  The 
AOC  contacted  Coaching  Into  Care,  explained  the  possibility  that  courts/attorneys  will  be 
assisting justice-involved veterans, and asked if court personnel could access the service or if it 
was  limited  to  family  and  friends  of  the  veteran.    The  representative  indicated  that  the  service 
also could be accessed by court personnel for guidance.  For additional information, call 1-888-

USA program.  A substantial amount of information can be found on the program’s website at 
http://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/cs/program_overview/,  which  summarizes  the  program  in

Mental  Health  First  Aid  is  offered  in  the  form  of  an  interactive  12-hour  course 
that presents an overview of mental illness and substance use disorders in the U.S. 
and  introduces  participants  to  risk  factors  and  warning  signs  of  mental  health 
problems,  builds  understanding  of  their  impact,  and  overviews  common 
treatments. Those who take  the 12-hour course to certify  as Mental Health First 
Aiders  learn  a  5-step  action  plan  encompassing  the  skills,  resources  and 
knowledge  to  help  an  individual  in  crisis  connect  with  appropriate  professional,

Our mission is to develop national networks of volunteers capable of responding 
to both acute and chronic conditions that arise within our society. Our first target 
population is the U.S. troops and families affected by the wars in Afghanistan and 
Iraq  and  other  post-9/11  conflicts.  Give  an  Hour™  is  asking  mental  health 
professionals  nationwide  to  literally  donate  an  hour  of  their  time  each  week  to 
provide  free  mental  health  services  to  military  personnel  and  their  families. 
Research will guide the development of additional services needed by the military 
community, and appropriate networks will be created to  respond to those needs. 
Individuals  who  receive  services  will  be  given  the  opportunity  to  give  an  hour 
back in their own community.

team  through  the  steps  which  are  necessary  to  create  an  effective  VTC.    The  AOC  found  this 
training to be extremely helpful and highly recommends it.  Registration is free, and scholarships 
are available for travel costs.  The registration deadline for the 2013 training was November 2, 
2012,  but  the  training  likely  will  be  offered  again  in  2014.    Contact  the  AOC  for  additional 
information regarding this training.

2.  *Explain specifically how this bill or amendment will impact your department or programs. 

his bill, if enacted, would amend Title 16 by creating the “Veterans Court Treatment Act.”  In addition to identifying potential costs 

associated with this legislation, the AOC will identify items which appear to require clarification before a court will be capable of 
implementing the proposed program/court/docket. 

ECTION 3 

Post-adjudicatory veterans court program” is defined, but it does not appear to be utilized anywhere in the bill.  Moreover, if this bill is 
designed to create a pre-adjudicatory veterans court program, which appears to be the case, it is unclear why a reference to a post-
adjudicatory program would be necessary. 

Pre-adjudicatory veterans court program” is defined, but it does not appear to be utilized anywhere in the bill.  The bill references 
“preadjudicatory veterans treatment intervention program” and “preadjudicatory veterans treatment program,” though, so the sponsors may 
wish to utilize consistent terminology throughout the bill. 

Service member” and “veteran” are defined and the bill appears to apply to both categories of persons, but the bill itself is inconsistent with 
regard to those references.  Many sections refer only to veterans when, presumably, they apply to both veterans and active service members.

The sponsors may wish to amend the bill to utilize one term which includes both active service members and veterans.  For the sake of 
convenience, the AOC’s support form will often reference veterans when both veterans and service members are at issue. 

Veterans court professional” is defined, but it does not appear to be utilized anywhere in the bill.   

The terms “veterans court team,” “judicial officer,” and “veterans treatment intervention team” are utilized in this bill but are not defined in 
the definition section.  The bill also does not define “controlled substance.”  That term is defined in 39-17-402, but that section does not 
apply to TCA Title 16. 

his section states that the “veterans court team” may request the assistance of various persons.  The AOC recommends that Fiscal Review 
contact the DA’s Conference and PD’s Conference regarding any additional staff which may become necessary due to this legislation.  Also, 
the AOC believes it is unlikely that every county will have a substance abuse liaison or mental health liaison who would be willing to 
perform the necessary tasks at no cost.  Therefore, there would be costs associated with those services.  The AOC will defer to the Tennessee 
Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs regarding what services (and to whom) they supply at 
no cost.     

lthough Fiscal Review may wish to contact the Comptroller’s Office and BOPP, the AOC does not believe that a probation officer would 

be permitted to perform these pre-adjudication functions.  Assuming they would be, however, the AOC assumes there would be costs 
associated with broadening the scope of their current duties. 

ubsection (a) of this section says, “If a defendant in a general sessions or criminal court is charged with a criminal offense and it is alleged 

that such defendant committed the offense as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, substance use disorder, or 
psychological problems stemming from service in a combat theater in the United States military, the court shall hold a veterans status hearing 
prior to hearing the matter.  The court shall order the defendant to submit to an eligibility screening and an assessment through the VA or the 
Tennessee department of veterans affairs to determine the defendant’s veteran status.  The defendant shall bear the burden of proof at the 
hearing.”  The AOC has the following questions regarding this subsection:  (1) Do the sponsors anticipate that a defendant (through whatever 
procedure is devised by the court) will admit that he/she committed a criminal offense but allege that one of the listed conditions was the 
cause?  If that’s what’s required and the defendant subsequently fails to successfully complete the program, can the defendant’s admission of 
guilt be used against him/her at trial if the district attorney decides to pursue the prosecution?; (2) What is a “substance use disorder”?  Also, 
does it have to be a controlled substance or can it be any substance?; (3) Do service members and veterans only qualify for this program if 
the alleged injury/disorder/problem stems from “service in a combat theater” or do all service members and veterans qualify?  This provision 
appears to limit it.  Also, the sponsors may wish to define “stemming from.”; (4) Is there a veterans office (either state or federal) in every 
county?  If not, who would be responsible for transporting a veteran/service member to the closest office for the necessary 
evaluations/assessments?  If the person is incarcerated, for example, will the sheriff be required to transport him/her?  If so, there will be 
costs associated with that transport.  If the person is not incarcerated and does not have access to transportation, how will he/she get to the 
closest office?  (5) The court is holding a status hearing “prior to hearing the matter.”  What does “prior to hearing the matter” mean?; (6) 
The referenced assessment is to “determine the defendant’s veteran status” and the defendant “shall bear the burden of proof at the hearing.”  
Does this mean that the only issue at this hearing is whether the defendant is a veteran (or a service member – as noted earlier, this bill often 
references “veteran” when service members should also be included) as opposed to determining whether the offense “stems from” the 
injury/disorder/problems alleged by the defendant? 

ubsection (b) says that the court shall order the defendant to submit to an eligibility screening and mental health and drug and alcohol 
screening and assessment by the VA or by the Tennessee department of veterans affairs.   Is this done after the hearing contemplated in 
subsection (a) or is it included in the assessment referenced in subsection (a)?  If the sponsors contemplate that the assessment includes 
confirmation of service member/veteran status as well as the drug/mental health assessment prior to the hearing noted in subsection (a), the 
sponsors may wish to combine these two subsections to clarify that issue as well as to clarify what the defendant has the burden of proving 
(and what standard applies – preponderance of the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, etc.?).  Also, subsection (b) says that the assessment 
is not necessary “if the court finds a valid screening or assessment related to the present charge pending against the defendant was completed 
within the previous sixty (60) days.”  What does “previous sixty (60) days” mean?  Is it 60 days prior to the “hearing,” 60 days prior to the 
filing of the defendant’s statement (or similar pleading as required by the procedure created by the court) alleging that the offense “stemmed 
from” the injury/disorder/problem, or 60 days prior to the commission of the alleged offense?   The bill also says that the assessment shall 
“include recommendations for treatment and shall be reflective of the level of risk of the individual.”  What does “level of risk” mean?  Is

this a reference to the severity of the mental health/drug issue, a reference to the possibility the person will reoffend, or something else?  
Finally, the AOC will defer to the VA and the Tennessee department of veterans affairs regarding whether such an assessment is available at 
no cost.  With regard to costs, though, Fiscal Review may wish to consider whether these offenders will be incarcerated (if they cannot make 
bond) while these assessments are being conducted.  If so, there will be costs associated with this incarceration.  The AOC spoke with the 
executive director of one of Tennessee’s mental health courts, and he said there is often a very long delay before services are available to 
veterans.  He said that the delays are partially due to the application process and partially due to volume.  

ubsection (c)’s reference to the court’s conclusion that the defendant is an eligible veteran (again, this should reference service members in 

addition to veterans) appears to contemplate that the hearing addresses all of the issues raised in subsections (a) and (b).  Therefore, those 
subsections need to be combined and/or clarified.  Subsection (c) also references a “condition of probation.”   It is the AOC’s understanding 
that this bill is designed to provide treatment to veterans and service members prior to disposition of the case so the person can avoid a 
conviction entirely.  Probation is ordered after, not before, a defendant is convicted unless pretrial diversion or judicial diversion is at issue, 
and this bill does not reference either of those.  Moreover, eligibility for pretrial and judicial diversion is very limited, so many of these 
offenders would not be eligible even if that is what the sponsors contemplated when referencing probation.  This subsection also 
contemplates that every court has access to a treatment program which will offer services at no cost.  The AOC believes it is unlikely that 
these services will in fact be available at no cost.   

ubsection (d) – Typographical error – Need to delete “an treatment program” and substitute “a treatment program.”  Also, do the sponsors 

contemplate that this treatment will be at no cost? 

ubsection (e) – Does this subsection contemplate that the program was offered in a previous criminal matter or at some point previously in 

the current matter? 

ubsection (h) – As noted earlier, “veterans treatment intervention team” is not defined by this legislation.  Also, the proposed sanctions 
include a “jail-based treatment program or serving a period of incarceration.”  If the defendant has not been convicted of anything, what 
authority is there to incarcerate him or her?  As noted earlier, because there has not been a conviction, this is not a situation in which the 
person is on probation.  Therefore, the court cannot revoke the probation and incarcerate the person if the person violates a condition of 
probation.  As such, under what authority is incarceration permitted? 

ubsection (i) and (j) – These subsections are unclear.  Do they mean that if the defendant successfully completes the program the court must 

dismiss the charges within 90 days, and that if the defendant does not successfully complete the program the court may order continued 
education/treatment or resumption of the prosecution, but that the court has to consider the district attorney’s recommendation regarding 
which of those two options (continued treatment vs. prosecution) would be appropriate? 

ECTION 9 

his section references a “chief judge,” and this title does not exist in Tennessee.  This should be changed to “presiding judge.”  This section 

also suggests that the veterans court/program could be included in a drug court program.  While that might be possible, the AOC’s 
understanding is that drug courts are post-adjudication courts, and this legislation contemplates a pre-adjudication program.  This proposed 
program appears to be more similar to mental health courts, which will be discussed elsewhere in this support form.  This section also states 
that the presiding judge may allow the veterans court program to operate in one county in a multiple-county judicial district.  The Office of 
the Attorney General may wish to comment regarding this provision since the Tennessee Constitution and the Tennessee Rules of Criminal 
Procedure state that a defendant has a right to be prosecuted in the county in which the alleged crime was committed.  Moreover, from a 
practical standpoint, it is the AOC’s understanding (based upon its conversation with a mental health court director) that the majority of 
persons with mental health and/or drug abuse issues have little or no support from family and friends, whom they likely have alienated, and 
do not have access to transportation.  Therefore, resources are necessary to provide for transportation within one county, and requiring these 
offenders to travel to another county would be an undue burden.  Moreover, if the person does not successfully complete the veterans 
program in one county and the prosecution elects to pursue the pending charges, the case would have to be sent back (for prosecution) to the 
county in which the offense was allegedly committed.  Therefore, the judge, defense counsel, and prosecutors assigned to the case might 
change, and the defendant’s records would be in two different counties.  Finally, this section says that the chief judge “may” establish a 
veterans court program.  Elsewhere in this bill, the sponsors utilized “shall” for many provisions.  Are these programs/courts/dockets 
mandatory or are they permissive?  If they are mandatory, which the bill appears to contemplate, the “may” in this section should be replaced 
by “shall” to avoid confusion.

SECTION 10 

ubsection (a) says that the defendant may be admitted into the program only if the prosecutor, defendant, and court agree.  This requirement 

should be included in Section 8 of this bill, and the procedures should be clarified.  If the prosecutor is not going to agree to the defendant’s 
inclusion in the program, many of the procedures in Section 8 of the bill would be unnecessary.    

ubdivision (b)(2) says a defendant is ineligible for the program if he/she “has been convicted of a crime against a person within the past ten 
(10) years, excluding incarceration time.”   First, how should “crime against a person” be defined?  Is it limited to the offenses listed in TCA 
Title 39, Chapter 13 (Offenses Against Person) and similar offenses in other states?  Also, the 10-year provision is somewhat unclear.  Does 
it mean that if a person was convicted of a crime against a person 19 years ago and served a sentence of 11 years, the person would eligible 
for this program because 19-11 = 8 years and 8 is less than 10?   Does this 10-year restriction apply only to a crime against a person or does 
it also apply to “any offense involving the discharge of a firearm or where occurred serious bodily injury or death to any person.”  This bill 
lists the offenses of “armed robbery” and “aggravated battery resulting in great bodily harm or permanent disability,” but these offenses do 
not exist in Tennessee.   Also, what does “involving the discharge of a firearm” mean?  If the discharge of a firearm is not an element of the 
offense but the facts of a particular person’s offense could have “involved” a firearm, does someone have to research the facts of the previous 
conviction?  If that has to be done for every offender, that could require considerable resources, especially if the conviction was not in the 
same county in which the current charges are pending.  For example, the elements of attempted first degree premeditated murder do not 
require the discharge of a firearm, but that offense might “involve” the discharge of a firearm.  That will not be known unless someone takes 
the time to look at the record from the previous conviction.  There is a similar problem regarding “any offense . . . where occurred (sic) 
serious bodily injury or death to any person.”  Using the same example, it’s possible that someone could have suffered serious bodily injury 
when an offender committed attempted first degree premeditated murder, but serious bodily injury is not an element of the offense and it’s 
possible that nobody suffered an injury.  This would not be known unless someone read the record from the previous trial/plea hearing. 

ubdivision (b)(3) says the person is not eligible if he or she “has previously completed or has been discharged from a veterans court 
program within three (3) years of an offense punishable as a felony or a Class A misdemeanor.”  Does the felony/Class A misdemeanor 
classification refer to the pending charges or to the previous offense for which the defendant was permitted to participate in a veterans court 
program? 

SECTION 11 

ubsection (a) says that if a defendant fails to meet the conditions of the program the defendant may, among other things “be sentenced.”   
How can the defendant be sentenced if this program is a pre-adjudication program and the defendant has not been convicted of a criminal 
offense? 

ubsection (b) – As previously noted, utilizing incarceration as a sanction does not appear to be appropriate or lawful if the defendant has not 

been convicted of a criminal offense.  The AOC spoke with the director of a mental health court in Tennessee, and he said that typical 
sanctions for violations include such things as requiring the person to report to the case manager more frequently or requiring more frequent 
drug testing.  The possible sanctions do not include incarceration.  

ubsection (c) – A “jail-based custodial treatment program” does not appear to be appropriate or lawful for a person who has not been 
convicted of a criminal offense.  Also, in the third line, there should be an “or” prior to “comply.”  Finally, why are the mental health 
conditions which are subject to treatment limited to post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and depression?  Maybe that should 
say “include, but are not limited to” if the sponsors wish to include all relevant mental health conditions. 

ubdivision (a)(4) references “his or her sentence.”  A person who has not been convicted of a criminal offense would not have a “sentence.” 

ubsection (b) – This subsection refers to “terminat[ing] the defendant’s sentence.”  Again, the defendant has not been convicted, so a 

ECTION 13 

sentence has not been imposed. 

ECTION 14 

ubdivision (a)(3) references a person who is “adjudicated at trial.”  It does not say that the person was found guilty.  Therefore, someone 

who goes to trial and is found not guilty will also be required to pay this $25.00.  That may have been the sponsors’ intent, but that is

unlikely.  As this legislation is drafted, it appears that every person who is charged with a criminal offense will eventually be required to pay 
$25.00 unless the district attorney dismisses the charges prior to trial.   

ubsection (b) says, in relevant part, that “[t]he assessment in subsection (a) shall be subject to 8-21-401 and shall be in addition to all other 
taxes, costs and fines.  The first five dollars ($5.00) of each such assessment shall be paid to the clerks of the court imposing assessment for 
the purposes of administering this chapter.”  First, if the sponsors wish to include all counties, the bill should reference 8-21-409 in addition 
to referencing 8-21-401.  Also, what does “shall be subject to 8-21-401” mean?  Is that an acknowledgement that 8-21-401 allows clerks to 
receive a commission (see also 8-21-409)?  If so, does the clerk take the allowable percentage (for commission) from the $25.00 fee and also 
take the first $5.00 of that fee?  What is the clerk’s role in “administering this chapter”?   

he bill says that the clerk shall deposit the remaining money into a dedicated county fund to “be used by the county exclusively for the 
creation and maintenance of state veterans courts as provided in this chapter.”  However, the bill also says that “[i]n the event no veterans 
court operates in the judicial district, the remainder of the funds from that county shall be remitted annually in full to the state of Tennessee 
to be placed in a veterans court resources fund to be administered by the department of finance and administration, office of the criminal 
justice programs, in accordance with Section 15.”  As previously noted, this bill appears to mandate the creation of a special 
court/docket/program for veterans.  If such a court/docket/program is mandatory, under what circumstances would “no veterans court 
operate[] in the judicial district”?   The Comptroller may wish to comment on any costs associated with its auditing responsibility under this 
subsection. 

ubsection (c) – This subsection says, among other things, that “[j]udges who wish to serve on veterans courts may apply for funds for 
training and continuing education on issues relevant to veterans.”   Would judges submit these applications to the court clerk, the office of 
criminal justice programs (“OCJP”), or some other entity? 

ECTION 15 

fter taking their commission and/or the $5.00 authorized by this bill, clerks will be putting the majority, if not all, of the money collected 
from the $25.00 assessment into a county fund.  Therefore, this section’s reference to money “collected and remitted to the state” must be 
referencing money which is submitted to OCJP if the judicial district does not establish a court for veterans.  Again, since the creation of 
such a court appears to be mandatory, it does not appear that any counties would be forwarding money to OCJP.  Assuming counties forward 
money to OCJP, this section states that the money in this fund shall be used “for the purposes of funding veterans court operations” and that 
OCJP shall “administer the money in the veterans court fund.”   Can that money only be used for judges’ “training and continuing education 
on issues relevant to veterans” as referenced in Section 14 of this bill, or can it be used for any veterans court purpose OCJP deems 
appropriate?   OCJP may wish to comment regarding any costs associated with administering the fund.   

ECTIONS 14 and 15 - EXAMPLE 

f the 31 judicial districts in Tennessee, 22 districts have more than one county in the district.  For example, the 1st Judicial District includes 
Carter, Johnson, Unicoi, and Washington counties.  If the presiding judge of that district decided to have a court/docket/program for veterans 
in Carter County, would the court clerks for Johnson, Unicoi and Washington counties be permitted to retain the $5.00 of the $25.00 fee even 
though there would not be a court/docket/program for veterans in their counties?  Also, as previously noted, the bill provides that the money 
“shall be used by the county exclusively for the creation and maintenance of state veterans courts as provided in this chapter.”  The money 
only goes to OCJP if the “judicial district” does not have a program for veterans.  Where does the money go if the “judicial district” operates 
a program for veterans but the county does not?  Using the 1st Judicial District as an example, since the veterans/service members from 
Johnson, Unicoi and Washington counties would be serviced by the program established in Carter County, it appears that Johnson, Unicoi 
and Washington counties should be sending the revenue generated by the $25.00 fee to Carter County for use in establishing and running the 
program.  However, it is unclear if the bill mandates, or even authorizes, that transfer of funds.  Importantly, the bill also does not appear to 
require Johnson, Unicoi and Washington counties to send the funds to OCJP since there would in fact be a veterans court operating in the 
judicial district.  Therefore, do Johnson, Unicoi and Washington counties merely retain the funds and utilize those funds to establish a special 
court/docket/program for veterans in the future?  If those counties never establish such a program, does the money simply remain unused? 

ECTION 17  

he effective date of this legislation is July 1, 2012.  Creating these new courts/dockets/programs will be a time-consuming process which 
will require extensive research, education, and deliberation regarding the most effective method of assisting veterans, and it will also require 
the coordination of numerous agencies, offices and programs.  The AOC does not believe that this can be accomplished by July 1, 2012.

6. Other Fiscal Impacts (If the impact cannot be placed into the above fields, is not specifically quantifiable, is a cost avoidance, or if 
additional information is needed to explain the fiscal impact(s) use the space below):   

he AOC has partially addressed the fiscal impact below, but PLEASE NOTE that the AOC identified other costs in Section 2 of this 

support form.   

REVENUE / FUNDING / SAVINGS 

f the eligible veterans successfully complete the veterans program and, as a result, are not incarcerated, there would be a reduction in 
incarceration costs.  The nature of that reduction would depend upon the number of veterans at issue, the offenses at issue, and the veterans’ 
criminal history (which is relevant to determining the appropriate sentencing range), among other things.  The AOC does not collect any 
statistics from the general sessions courts, and the AOC’s available statistics from the trial courts do not reflect whether a perpetrator was a 
veteran/service member. 

ith regard to funding, Section 14 proposes a $25.00 fee for the four listed categories of persons.  As previously noted, this legislation 

authorizes the court clerk to take $5.00 of this fee (it’s unclear whether this is in addition to the clerk’s currently-authorized commission).  In 
addition to considering how much of the $25.00 clerks will be taking, Fiscal Review should consider how many offenders will actually pay 
the $25.00 fee.  Approximately 75% of criminal offenders are indigent and will not be capable of paying such a fee or any other 
costs/taxes/fines associated with their prosecution.  Given the current state of the economy as well as the numerous fines/fees/taxes imposed 
upon litigants in criminal courts, it is unlikely that the remaining 25% of the offenders will be capable of paying their court bills in full.  
Based upon the relevant statutes and other pertinent information, the automated system utilized by many clerks’ offices prioritizes (and 
distributes) incoming payments in the following order:  state litigation taxes, county litigation taxes, clerk fees, other fees due to the county

(officer cost, etc.), other fees due to the state, fines, and restitution.  Because offenders are unlikely to pay their bills in full and because the 
revenue which is generated must be used to satisfy so many other obligations prior to being utilized for the veterans courts, the AOC believes 
that the $25.00 fee imposed by this legislation is unlikely to generate a substantial amount of revenue.  The AOC has no means of measuring 
the potential revenue, though, because the AOC does not collect any offender/offense statistics from the general sessions courts and because 
all costs/fees/fines (regardless of whether the court at issue is a trial court or general sessions court) are submitted directly to the individual 
counties as opposed to the AOC.    
 

 
COSTS 

s noted in Section 2 of this support form, the proposed court/docket/program appears to be similar to a pre-adjudication mental health court.  

Upon inquiry, OCJP informed the AOC that it is aware of four mental health courts in Tennessee (Davidson County, Coffee County, 
Washington County, and Madison County).  OCJP assists in funding one of the four established courts, providing the county’s mental health 
court with $75,000, which the county is required to supplement with $25,000 as a condition of receiving those funds.  The court’s expenses 
are recurring expenses, so this is a three-year grant and OCJP’s expenditure is $75,000 per year.  According to OCJP, these funds are for 
staff salaries and benefits, supplies, telephone, occupancy, travel, and “a little in professional fees for evaluation.”  With regard to staff, 
OCJP stated that these funds pay for two staff members and 5% of the mental health court director’s time.  The director’s salary is 
supplemented, in part, by grants for a separately-funded and separately-run drug court.   

he AOC spoke with the executive director of this mental health court.  According to the director, $100,000 “opens the doors” but little else.  

The county has a non-profit foundation which supports an existing drug court, and the mental health court often receives financial and other 
support from that organization (providing free photocopies of paperwork, for example).  In addition to acknowledging that the $100,000 only 
funds 5% of his salary, he stated that those funds are not adequate to provide the participants with the required mental health treatment.  
Also, persons with mental health and drug issues often do not have access to transportation, and they often have very little support from 
family and friends.  Therefore, his program struggles to provide transportation for the participants.  As noted in Section 2 of this support 
form, requiring participants to travel within the county is challenging enough, but requiring them to travel to another county (for an 
assessment/evaluation if those federal/state services are not available in the person’s county or for court hearings or meetings with the case 
manager if the judicial district only has a veterans court in one county of the district) would be even more challenging and costly.  This 
should be considered when determining the cost of this legislation.  The director said that his participants are also typically in need of 
clothing and housing, and resources are necessary to assist the participants in resolving those issues.  Finally, the director noted that many 
mental health court participants are repeat offenders who lost their TennCare benefits when previously incarcerated.  Those offenders “face 
the monumental task of benefit reinstatement in order to obtain the necessary medication to help them function as normally as possible.”  
Fiscal Review may wish to consult with the Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs 
regarding the circumstances in which repeat offenders lose their benefits through those organizations as well.   
  
Although it is likely that each mental health court functions slightly differently, the director said that in his county the offenders’ cases are 
continued while the offenders participate in the program.  If they successfully complete the program, the charges are often dismissed.  His 
program can serve a maximum of 20 offenders.  Participants are in daily contact with a case manager, and they must appear before the court 
and meet with a case manager at least once per week for a status check.  Due to the nature of their conditions, though, it is not unusual for the 
participants to “disappear” and lose contact with the case manager entirely.  If a participant fails to comply with the requirements of the 
program but the violations are not serious enough to warrant resumption of the prosecution in lieu of treatment, sanctions typically include 
such things as requiring the participant to meet with a case manager or submit to a drug test on a more frequent basis.  Incarceration is not 
permissible unless the participant is on probation for another offense, the mental health court program violation also constitutes a violation of 
the participant’s probation, and the court incarcerates the participant after conducting a hearing and concluding that the probation violation 
warrants a period of incarceration.  As noted in Section 2 of this support form, this bill contemplates incarceration as a sanction and the AOC 
questions whether this is appropriate or lawful. 

n addition to the four counties identified by OCJP, the AOC learned that Warren County recently received a federal grant of $1.2 million 
(OCJP was not involved with securing this grant) to fund mental health treatment for offenders for a three-year period.  Warren County has 
an existing post-adjudication drug court, and the offenders who have mental health issues will receive post-adjudication treatment through 
this existing court, which will now be a joint mental health/drug court.  According to the director of that program, the $1.2 million will not be 
used by his office or by the court.  Instead, the $1.2 million will be used exclusively by the mental health provider, and that provider will be 
responsible for evaluating, treating, and monitoring offenders for the next three years.  A maximum of 60 participants per year can be served 
under this program.

As noted above, the AOC’s statistics do not reflect whether a perpetrator was a veteran or service member.  Therefore, the AOC cannot 
predict how many offenders would be eligible for the programs proposed by this legislation.  However, if each judicial district/county is 
required to create this special court/docket/program, there will be costs associated with doing so regardless of how many offenders ultimately 
are served by the court/docket/program.  There are 95 counties (31 judicial districts) in Tennessee.  A conservative estimate for the salary of 
the director of a veterans court would be $50,000 ($35,000 base salary plus benefits).  Moreover, a minimum annual expenditure of $100,000 
would be necessary to provide two case managers and basic supplies for a specialized court for a small county.  Additionally, there will be 
costs associated with the mental health and drug abuse assessments and treatments contemplated by this bill.  As previously noted, the 
already-established drug court in Warren County will be using $1.2 million over the next three years for mental health evaluation, treatment 
and monitoring costs for a maximum of 60 participants per year.  The AOC recommends that Fiscal Review contact the Tennessee 
Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to determine whether they have offices in every 
county in Tennessee as well as whether they have the necessary resources to provide mental health and drug abuse evaluations and treatment 
to every person who qualifies for the veterans court program.  In addition to addressing general coverage issues, Fiscal Review may wish to 
ask those agencies if they provide services to active service members or if those services are only available to veterans.  If the agencies 
would not provide the anticipated services for all service members and veterans in every county in Tennessee, there will be expenditures 
associated with securing those services.   

he mental health court director referenced above works closely with local mental health groups which secure federal funding in an effort to 

provide treatment at no cost.  The AOC does not believe it would be appropriate for Fiscal Review to assume that such resources are 
available in every county or judicial district.  If the veterans affairs agencies are not willing or able to provide the necessary assessments 
and/or treatment, it is unclear who would be responsible for the costs of those services.  The AOC does not pay for drug treatment and only 
pays for mental health evaluations in limited circumstances.  With regard to the latter, there are significant costs involved.  For example, a 
competency evaluation by a psychologist typically costs approximately $5,000, and the psychologist often finds that an additional evaluation 
is necessary regarding the offender’s mental state at the time of the alleged offense.  This additional evaluation is conducted by a psychiatrist 
and costs an additional $5,000.  These are merely preliminary evaluations and do not include any necessary treatment.  Moreover, Tennessee 
Supreme Court Rule 13 (“Rule 13”) only authorizes the AOC to compensate experts for services for indigent offenders, and the participants 
in the veterans court program may or may not be indigent. Finally, Rule 13 authorizes payment at the trial court level as opposed to the 
general sessions court level, and based upon the AOC’s reading of this legislation it appears that the intervention will most likely occur at the 
general sessions court level.  Fiscal Review may wish to contact the Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities and any 
other relevant agencies regarding what services they are willing/authorized to provide.    

lthough the procedure contemplated by this legislation is somewhat unclear, there is a possibility that offenders who are awaiting 

assessment will remain incarcerated for a longer period of time than an offender whose case is proceeding through the court system in the 
typical manner.  Therefore, the Comptroller may wish to comment regarding any potential costs associated with incarceration in the local 
jails. 
   
The AOC has heard, but has not confirmed, that the American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern that veterans court programs may 
have constitutional implications since similarly-situated offenders are being treated more harshly than veterans.  Also, there may be 
constitutional problems with requiring veterans in a multi-county judicial district to participate in a program which is not offered in the 
county in which the alleged offense occurred.  Therefore, the Office of the Attorney General may wish to comment regarding any costs 
which may be associated with defending the constitutionality of this legislation. 

he Board of Probation and Parole, Office of Criminal Justice Programs, District Attorneys General Conference, Tennessee Association of 

Criminal Defense Lawyers, Court Clerks, and District Public Defenders Conference may also wish to comment regarding any costs 
associated with their responsibilities pursuant to this legislation.
