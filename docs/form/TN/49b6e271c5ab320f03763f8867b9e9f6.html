AT NASHVILLE

JUL 1 7 2018
Clerk of the Appellate Courts
nec'd By

IN RE: AMENDMENT OF RULE 6, RULES OF THE TENNESSEE
SUPREME COURT

No. ADM2018-713

COMMENT FROM THE UNDERSIGNED LAW PROFESSORS AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF LAW

We appreciate the opportunity to provide a comment in response to the
Court's proposal to adopt a Tennessee Law Course as an admission requirement for
Tennessee  attorneys.  We understand  that  the  Court's  proposal  is  made in
conjunction with its adoption of the Uniform Bar Examination (UBE).

As University of Tennessee law professors educating many students who will
practice in Tennessee, we endeavor to introduce unique aspects of Tennessee law
and practice in the classroom. We have no doubt that our colleagues at Tennessee's
other law schools do the same. But we are mindful that many bar applicants are
educated in other states where Tennessee law is not a point of discussion. Moreover,
all new Tennessee attorneys—regardless of where they received their law degree—
can benefit from learning or reviewing key aspects of Tennessee law and practice.

We view the adoption  of the UBE as a positive  development and the
Tennessee Law Course as an opportunity. While bar exams have traditionally
emphasized memorization, the Tennessee Law Course could reinforce the research
necessary to competently represent clients in practice in Tennessee.

In this comment, we provide some suggestions for possible content of a
Tennessee Law Course and offer our services in developing and teaching the course.

Tennessee Law Course Objectives and Content

The Tennessee Law Course could help prepare new attorneys for at least
three things they will do in practice in Tennessee: (1) identifying significant issues
in  Tennessee law; (2) researching relevant bodies of Tennessee law; and (3)
navigating the  Tennessee court system. These appear to  be appropriate  and
achievable objectives for the course.

In  discussing  the  possible  content  for  a  Tennessee  Law Course, we

considered the aspects of Tennessee law that will no longer be tested on the essay

portion of the UBE. The current essay exam may test Tennessee state law in the

following key subject matter areas: (1) Constitutional Law; (2) Criminal Law and

Procedure; (3) Contracts; (4) Torts; (5) Property; (6) Evidence; (7) Civil Procedure;

(8) Business  Organizations; (9) Wills  and  Estates; (10) Family  Law; (11)

Professional Responsibility; and (12) Conflicts of Laws.' While these subjects (other

than Professional Responsibility) are still on the essay portion of the UBE, it is our

understanding that specific aspects of Tennessee law will not be tested.

One approach that the Court might consider is a Tennessee Law Course that

addresses each of these twelve subject matter areas. In each area, bar applicants

could be introduced to: (1) important or unique aspects of Tennessee law;2 and (2)

relevant bodies of Tennessee law and resources for researching the law.

For  example, even  though  the  Multistate  Professional  Responsibility

Examination tests an applicant's understanding of the Model Rules of Professional

Conduct, it does not test the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct. Tennessee's

professional conduct rules are different from the Model Rules in some key respects.

The Tennessee Law Course could provide instruction about unique provisions of the

Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct, key cases concerning malpractice and

breach of fiduciary duty, and resources such as the Tennessee Board of Professional

Responsibility website with its  links to the rules, formal ethics opinions, and

information for obtaining advice from ethics counsel.

We are mindful that Tennessee law is wholly unique in some areas.  For

instance, Tennessee's limited liability company law is the only law of its kind in the

nation—providing for  three  types  of limited  liability  company—with unique

structures and substantive law attached to each. This is a significant departure from

the two forms available under the uniform law and the laws of other states. We take

the view that it is particularly important to identify and characterize these one-of-a-

kind bodies of law for new bar members.

Course Handbook

One benefit of the Tennessee Law Course is that the course materials could

become a resource for new (and even seasoned) Tennessee attorneys as they begin

their legal research. We envision an annually updated Tennessee Law Course

1 The current Tennessee essay exam also tests  Commercial Transactions (UCC

Articles 1, 2, and 9) and Restitution and Remedies. We believe that the UCC is

adequately addressed by the UBE and that relevant aspects of Restitution and

Remedies could be included in other subject areas.

2 The Tennessee court system could be discussed in the civil procedure segment of

the course.

2

Handbook that addresses each of the twelve subject matter areas, including links to

key research resources.

While some time  would be involved  in  annually  updating the  Course

Handbook, the time investment would be most significant in the first year. The

annual update to the Course Handbook could be made available for free on the

Court's website.

Course Delivery Method

Whether course lectures are delivered online or in-person (or both), we

think that each lecture could be of varying length, ranging from twenty minutes to

an hour. After the Course Handbook is developed, it may become apparent that

lectures are unnecessary on certain topics because the written materials are so

straightforward and accessible to new attorneys. We do not envision dry lectures

with presenters reading from the Course Handbook. Instead, the goal should be to

provide informative talks that help new attorneys feel excited about (and prepared

for) the work they will do as lawyers in Tennessee.

Ideally, a new attorney would be allowed to select the course format—online

or in-person—that works best for his or her needs. An in-person course is typically

more engaging and allows for interaction between teacher and students. The in-

person course may be a good fit for new attorneys who have the time and

inclination to finish the entire course in a single day. The in-person course could

potentially be offered twice a year. Offering the in-person course in a single location

would be an option if most students could be expected to opt for the online course.

We see several advantages of an online course option (with lectures recorded

from the  in-person  course). First  and foremost, the  online  course  could  be

completed throughout the year at the attorney's own pace. Second, an online course

could be accessed anywhere in the state. Third, an online course would provide

uniform content and instruction for all new Tennessee attorneys. Finally, with an

online course, it would be relatively simple to include a few (3-5) multiple-choice

questions at the end of each segment, the majority of which must be answered

correctly before the attorney gets credit for completing the segment.

Our Offer to Develop and Teach the Course

As professors at the University of Tennessee College of Law, we feel a special

responsibility and pride in educating Tennessee lawyers. We would be pleased to

serve the Court by developing the Course Handbook and teaching the Tennessee

Law Course. For over 125 years, UT Law has endeavored to provide an outstanding

legal  education to  our students. We would bring this same commitment the

Tennessee Law Course.

3

Beyond our knowledge of the subjects we regularly teach at UT Law, we have

other relevant experiences that we would draw upon in developing the Tennessee

Law Course. In recent years, we have developed and taught a daylong Tennessee bar

review course as a way to give our graduates a jumpstart on studying for the bar

exam. Through the years, many UT Law professors have taught Tennessee law in

commercial bar preparation courses and developed related teaching materials. In

addition, many of us have served on commissions, committees, and played other

roles in drafting and proposing changes to Tennessee law. Finally, in partnership

with various bar associations and other groups, many of us give back to the

Tennessee legal community by teaching Tennessee Continuing Legal Education

(CLE) courses.

We would be able to leverage this knowledge and experience in developing a

Tennessee Law Course that will serve all of the new attorneys in Tennessee. Our

teaching experience would allow us to develop the course in the relatively short

time period necessary to offer it to those new attorneys who take the February 2019

bar examination.

Course Timing

Course Fees

We know that the Court has proposed the Tennessee Law Course as a post-

admission requirement. We like this approach. With some context of law practice,

the Tennessee Law Course may be more meaningful and helpful to new Tennessee

lawyers. They may also have more energy to devote to the course after they have

finished law school and bar exam preparation.

In light of the other costs of bar admission, it would be ideal if the course

could be offered with no additional fee to bar applicants. We hope that the cost of

administering the course could be contained by the contribution of time and effort

by those who develop and teach the course as a service to the bar.

Beyond the Tennessee Law Course: Bridge-to-Practice CLEs for New Attorneys

Once new attorneys start practicing law, they face challenges and have

questions they did not have in law school. We have discussed and appreciate the

value of so-called  Bridge-to-Practice or Bridge-the-Gap CLE programming that

guides new lawyers in developing the practical knowledge and skills needed in day-

to-day  practice.3 We think  that  such  programming  would  complement the

Tennessee Law Course.

3 Almost twenty years ago, the Court considered, but ultimately rejected, a TBA

petition to amend Rule 21 to adopt a Professional Practice Skills program. The

proposal is described in detail in a 1999 Tennessee Bar Journal article. Douglas A.

4

With some guidance from the  Court or the Tennessee Commission on

Continuing  Legal  Education  about desired  topics  and teaching  methods,4 bar

associations and other qualified organizations could develop Bridge-to-Practice CLE

programs to be approved by the Commission. The programs could fall  within

categories such as: (1) issues of interest in a select practice area (employment law

practice, administrative law practice, etc.); (2) issues of interest in a practice type

(solo practice, government practice, etc.); (3) managing relationships with clients

and employers; (4) skills development (taking and defending depositions, drafting

contracts, etc.); (5) personal development and care (mental health, substance abuse,

etc.); and (6) professionalism and professional responsibility challenges for new

lawyers.

Rather than requiring all new attorneys to take the same Bridge-to-Practice

CLEs, each new attorney could be allowed to choose the CLE programs that best fit

their interests, challenges, and practice needs.  The Court could set a minimum

number of CLE hours that a new attorney must earn in Bridge-to-Practice credits in

the first two years of practice.

This is a flexible approach that would be easy to implement and that might

generate innovative and practical programs from CLE providers. Based on course

evaluations, the CLE Commission and Court would be able to determine issues such

as: whether more guidance is needed in how the courses are developed and taught;

if certain Bridge-to-Practice CLEs (perhaps because they are so well-received or

universally applicable) should be mandatory; or whether the required number of

Bridge-to-Practice CLE hours should be increased or decreased.

Conclusion

We appreciate the opportunity to provide this comment to the Court and

remain at its disposal to respond to any questions or provide further information.

IN RE: AMENDMENT OF RULE 6, RULES OF THE TENNESSEE SUPREME COURT
No. ADM2018-713

Dear Chief Justice Bivins, Justice Clark, Justice Kirby, Justice Lee, and Justice Page:

This comment letter is in response to the Order of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, filed
April 19, 2018, requesting written comments respecting proposed revisions to Tennessee
Supreme Court Rule 6.

In the interest of disclosure, I have chaired the Memphis Bar Association Professionalism
Committee since January 2017; however, these comments are made by me individually and
not as chair or on behalf of that committee.

I have a background and continuing interest in the subject matter of this proposed rule
change - focusing on developing the skills and professionalism of new lawyers admitted to
the bar. Through the Memphis Bar Association, I assisted with efforts to establish a formal
mentor-training course and co-presented the pilot training course in 2015. In 2017, the
professionalism committee began providing panelists of experienced lawyers to present
programs on lawyer mental health, professionalism and career guidance to law students in
the externship course at the Memphis Law School. In 2006, I developed the curriculum for

Yvonne K. Chapman Comment to the Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 6, No. ADM2018-713
Page 1

a mandatory pre-admission course' for the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) and

managed the statewide program implementing this course until January 2008.

As I developed curriculum for each of these programs, I have studied the issues that

necessitate them, including the 1992 ABA Report of the Task Force on Law School and the

Profession: Narrowing the Gap, titled Legal Education and Professional Development- An

Education Continuum (MacCrate Report), Overview of Fundamental Lawyering Skills and

Values, commonly referred to as the MacCrate Report.2

In its introduction, the MacCrate Report explains,

[T]he title of this Report attempts to correct the distortion, and suggests a different

and more accurate vision of the relationship between legal education and the

practicing bar. Both communities are part of one profession. The skills and values of

the competent lawyer are developed along a continuum that starts before law

school, reaches its  most formative and intensive stage during the law school

experience,  and  continues  throughout  a  lawyer's  professional  career.  Legal

educators and practicing lawyers should stop viewing themselves as separated by a

"gap" and recognize that they are engaged in a common enterprise-the education

and professional development of the members of a great profession. MacCrate

Report, p. 3.

The Task Force "examined the process by which lawyering skills and professional values

are acquired: before law school, during law school and after law school," provided a

"Statement of Skills and Values'" along with recommendations on how to build and develop

those skills and values. Those Fundamental Lawyering Skills and Fundamental Values of

the Profession reflect a list of skills and values that an individual needs to become a

competent and responsible member of the profession, the skills and values that other

practitioners, legal employers, and judges often expect new attorneys to possess.

The Report directed its recommendations, in particular, to providers of continuing legal

education "to assist new lawyers to acquire necessary skills and values and also in the

development of other CLE programs to enrich generally the quality of instruction and

enhance the process of professional development." MacCrate Report, p. 328.

Additional  recommendations  directed  to  licensing  authorities  suggested  mandating

transition education and mentoring programs. MacCrate Report, p. 285-304, 334-335.

1 See Washington Supreme Court APR 5 (b)(2), e(1)and (4) Preadmission Requirements. (last amended

September 1, 2017). The preadmission program is a four-hour educational course that is prerequisite to

admission to practice law in Washington State. The applicant must complete the course after being notified of

passing the bar examination or qualifying for admission by reciprocity.

More recently, in a Foreword to the 2007 Best Practices Report3, Bob MacCrate reiterated,

the "central message... is that law schools should broaden the range of lessons they teach,

reducing doctrinal instruction that uses the Socratic dialogue and the case method;

integrate the teaching of knowledge, skills and values, and not treat them as separate

subjects addressed in separate courses; and give much greater attention to instruction in

professionalism."

As stated in Twenty Years After the MacCrate Report4, "law schools have been urged to

move from a focus primarily on legal doctrine and theory to include more of an emphasis

on programs that prepare students for the profession  to teach more skills, to develop

habits and values, to modify or expand the curriculum to prepare students for the global,

regulatory world we live in, and to ensure that students understand the economics of the

market and are business-literate." See Twenty Years, p. 8.

Perhaps in  response to  MacCrate and its  aftermath, the Tennessee Commission on

Continuing Legal Education and Specialization ("Commission") established the "Mentoring

Initiative" in an effort to provide beginning lawyers with access to more resources and to

encourage veteran attorneys to help guide and develop new lawyers.5 A pilot program

offering CLE credits began July 1, 2013, but expired December 31, 2016.6

Should this Court decide that the additional hurdle for new lawyers suggested by this

proposed rule — a mandatory post-admission course - would make a difference to the

profession overall, then any curriculum design should deviate from the legal doctrine and

theory suggested in the proposal. Rather, its focus should be on those skills, values,

professionalism, and business development knowledge as continually recommended

beginning with the report of the MacCrate commission.

charge a reasonable fee for such training. With regard to mentors participating in a mentoring program

sponsored by a governmental or non-profit organization, the Commission is authorized to provide such

training at no charge. This subparagraph (d) shall take effect on July 1, 2013, and shall expire on December

31, 2016, unless affirmatively readopted by the Supreme Court. http://www.tsc.state.tn.us/rules/supreme-

The Tennessee CLE Commission was on the right track when it developed its mentoring

worksheets,7 as these provide excellent curriculum resources to address the skills, values,

professionalism, and fundamental business issues facing lawyers.

"[I]nstruction on areas of Tennessee civil and criminal procedure, real estate, wills, estates

and trusts, business organizations, family law, and administrative law," as listed in the

proposed rule, will be of little value to recently admitted attorneys, particularly those who

were just examined on those subjects through a bar admission test.

One other sincere concern about the proposed rule is its requirement to set and collect a

fee for the mandatory post-admission course. I urge the proponents to consider a no-fee

program. An additional fee for this mandatory program will further burden law graduates

and new bar applicants who are encumbered with significant debt from law school loans

and the cost of admission to the bar. The failure to pay this course fee, a requirement for

compliance, subjects the new attorney to suspension from practice and additional financial

penalties.

A final observation is that so few have filed comments regarding this proposed rule as of

this deadline date; this is astounding to me.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Respectfully,

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
