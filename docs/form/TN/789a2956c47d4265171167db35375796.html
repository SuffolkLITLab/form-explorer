      <pre>Memorial Resolution  

 
 Honorable Alan Ewing Glenn 
October 3, 1942 - November 4, 2021  
 
June 2022 
  
Alan Ewing Glenn, died November 4, 2021, following a heart-related illness. He is 

survived by his wife of 42 years, Minna, and their son, Andrew, both of Memphis. He is 
additionally survived by a sister, Nancy Gollobin, of Cincinnati, as well as several nieces and 
nephews. He was predeceased by his parents, Ruth and Ward Glenn, of Nashville. 

          Judge Glenn was born in Nashville, Tennessee on October 3, 1942, and graduated from 
Montgomery Bell Academy, Vanderbilt University, and Vanderbilt Law School. Following his 
1971 law school graduation, he moved to Memphis to begin working as an assistant district 
attorney. After eleven years with the Shelby County District Attorney's Office, he joined the 
Memphis law firm of Evans Petree. From 1986 until 1999, he taught trial advocacy at Harvard 
Law School, spending three weeks each year in Cambridge. 

           In 1999, he was appointed by Governor Don Sundquist to the Tennessee Court of 
Criminal Appeals, Western Division, where he served faithfully until his retirement on July 1, 
2021. In addition to his regular duties as a Court of Criminal Appeals Judge, he served as chair 
of the Judicial Ethics Committee from 2005 until 2019, drafting over a dozen ethics opinions and 
answering almost daily telephone calls and emails from judges across the State who sought his 
guidance on ethics issues. 

           Judge Glenn had a wry sense of humor and an unassuming, highly approachable manner. 
When telephone calls came into his chambers, he frequently picked up the line before his law 
clerks or administrative assistant could answer, always responding with a friendly "This is 
Alan." He was equally friendly in person, always ready to answer questions and provide support 
to new Judges on the Court of Criminal Appeals, his own law clerks, and the law clerks of his 
fellow judges. He especially enjoyed performing marriage ceremonies, officiating at the 
weddings of a number of young couples over his years as a judge. Many of those couples 
remained in regular contact with him until his death. 

            Among his hobbies were reading mystery novels and cooking. He was an avid cook who 
regularly shared recipes and dishes with others, including at monthly meetings of his book club. 
He was also a lifelong dog lover and supporter of animal rescue, sharing his home with several 
rescue dogs over the years. Judge Glenn served on the Board of Directors of the National 
Ornamental Metal Museum for over thirty years, including a term as president, served as 
president of the Memphis Arts in the Parks Festival, and served as vice president of Theatre 
Memphis. He joined Idlewild Presbyterian Church in 1999. He engaged in several Sunday 
school courses over the years, including the Timothy and Faith & Function Classes, and was also 

   

   

   

   

a faithful member of the Hospitality team for thirteen years beginning in 2009. He was ordained 
as a deacon in 2010 and served as a deacon in the class of 2012 and the class of 2018. 
  
  
  
foregoing memorial resolution in honor of our dear departed colleague, ALAN EWING 
GLENN, be entered on the minutes of the Conference, that a copy be furnished to Thomson 
West Publishing Company for publication in Tennessee Decisions and BE IT FURTHER 
RESOLVED that a copy of this tribute and resolution be furnished to his family.  

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Tennessee Judicial Conference that the 

Respectfully submitted this the 15th day of June 2022 in Franklin, Tennessee at the 

Annual Meeting of the Tennessee Judicial Conference. 

ohn W. Campbell, Sr. 
Court of Criminal Appeals 
Western Section

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
