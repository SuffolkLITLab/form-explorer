OPINION

I.  Background

This appeal arises from a contentious divorce that has been pending since 2017.  The 
record  is  voluminous,  so  in  the  interest  of  judicial  economy,  we  will  discuss  only  those 
facts and proceedings that are relevant to this appeal. 

Stacie Waddell (“Wife”) and David Waddell (“Husband”) married in March 2002.  
Two children were born to the marriage, Easton (d/o/b September 2002) and Saylor (d/o/b 
March  2006)  (together,  the  “Children”).    For  most of  the  marriage,  Husband  was  the 
President and CEO of Waddell & Associates, Inc. (“W&A, Inc.”), a company his mother 
and father founded in 1985.  Although Wife was primarily a stay-at-home mother during 
the marriage, she also worked at W&A, Inc. as the Global Communications Director but 
did not receive a salary during her tenure there.

At the time of its founding, Husband’s parents owned 100% of the shares of W&A, 
Inc.  stock.    Eventually,  two  other  individuals,  Alvin Wunderlich  and  Phyllis  Scruggs,
obtained shares in the company (333 and 177, respectively).  In 2005, Husband’s father 
created the Waddell Trust, with an initial res of $42,000.00.  Husband was named Trustee, 
and Husband and the Children were named as beneficiaries of the trust.  Around this time, 
the  Waddell  Trust  purchased  Mr.  Wunderlich’s  333  shares  for  $400,000,  which  was
payable under a promissory note.  In 2009, Husband’s father created a second trust, the 
DSW Trust, and placed 667 shares of W&A, Inc. stock (all of the stock Husband’s parents 
owned) into that trust.  Again, Husband was named Trustee, and Husband and the Children
were named as beneficiaries of the trust.  With this transfer of shares, the Waddell Trust 
and the DSW Trust together owned 85% of the shares of W&A, Inc. stock.  

In April 2016, W&A, Inc. redeemed the remaining 177 shares, i.e., the remaining 
15%  of  shares, in  W&A,  Inc.  stock.    At  this  time,  Husband,  as  Trustee  of  both  trusts, 
merged the Waddell Trust into the DSW Trust.  Also, around this time, Focus Financial 
Partners, LLC (“Focus”) and Waddell & Associates, LLC (“W&A, LLC”)1 purchased all 

                                           

1 W&A, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Focus.

- 2 -

of  W&A,  Inc.’s  assets.    After  the  sale,  W&A,  Inc.  changed  its  name  to  AMWJR,  Inc., 
which subsequently entered into a plan of dissolution and has since been fully dissolved. 

On  April  13,  2016,  the DSW  Trust #2 (together  with  the  Waddell  Trust  and  the 
DSW Trust, the “Trusts,” and together with W&A, LLC and AMWJR, Inc., the “Entities”)
was created.  The Grantor of the DSW Trust #2 was the DSW Trust, by Husband, as Trustee 
of  the  DSW  Trust.   The  Trustee  of  the  DSW Trust  #2  was  Husband,  individually.    The 
beneficiaries of this trust are Husband and the Children.  In his capacity as Trustee of both 
the DSW Trust and the DSW Trust #2, Husband decanted the trust property from the DSW 
Trust into the DSW Trust #2.  In short, all of the amounts received from the sale of W&A, 
Inc. were moved into the DSW Trust #2.  On April 7, 2017, Husband resigned as Trustee 
of  the  DSW Trust  #2,  and  Cumberland  Trust  &  Investment  Company  (“Cumberland
Trust”) became the Trustee.

On August 4, 2017, Wife filed her initial complaint for divorce in the Circuit Court 
for  Shelby  County  (“trial  court”).    Wife  alleged  irreconcilable  differences,  asked  to  be
named the primary residential parent of the Children, and asked for both temporary and 
permanent child support.  Wife did not plead for alimony.  On September 5, 2017, Wife 
filed  her  amended  complaint  for  divorce and  alleged  that  Husband  was  guilty  of 
inappropriate marital conduct.2  Wife also joined the Entities as defendants, alleging that 
each  entity  held  assets  that  were  “marital  in  nature.”    Additionally,  Wife  asked  for 
attorney’s fees and expenses, but she did not specifically ask for alimony.3  On September 
13,  2017,  Wife  filed  her  first  motion  for  pendente  lite support,  requesting  temporary 
alimony, child support, and attorney’s fees.  As will be discussed further, infra, Wife filed 
several requests for temporary support throughout the divorce proceedings.  Although the 
parties  participated  in  a  multi-day,
temporary-support  hearing,  that  hearing  never 
concluded, and Wife was never awarded ongoing temporary support, see further discussion 
infra.    On  October  31,  2017,  the  parties  entered  into  a  consent  order  on  a  temporary 
parenting schedule.  

On  November  10,  2017,  W&A,  LLC filed  a  motion  to  intervene  for  the  limited 
purpose of protecting the property of the company.  On November 14, 2017, the parties 
entered into consent protective orders concerning confidential information belonging to the 
Entities.  In part, these orders required the parties to allow a third-party vendor to “collect 
all copies of electronically stored and/or print copies of downloads and all computers and 
removable media . . . ever used by Wife on behalf of any business entity in which Defendant 
now has an interest, or has had an interest in the past, as well as access codes, passwords 
and/or authorization codes.”  On November 28, 2017, Husband filed an answer to Wife’s 
                                           

2 For completeness, we note that Husband filed his answer to the original complaint for divorce 
seven minutes prior to Wife filing her amended complaint.  Accordingly, Wife filed a motion to amend her 
original complaint, which was granted in November 2017.  

3 Wife included the standard request that she be awarded “such other and further relief both general 

and special as under the pleadings and proof she may be entitled to in the premises[.]”

- 3 -

amended complaint and a counter-complaint for divorce.  In part, Husband asserted that 
Wife failed to state a claim against the Entities and failed to demonstrate that the trial court 
had  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  the  Entities.    Husband  also  asked  to  be  named  the 
Children’s primary residential parent.  

In January 2018, the Entities filed motions to dismiss, alleging that Wife’s amended 
petition failed to state a claim against any of the Entities.  In May 2018, the trial court heard 
the motions to dismiss and denied them by order of May 23, 2018.  In June and September 
2018, the Entities filed motions to revise, arguing that the trial court erred in denying the 
motions to dismiss.

On July 2, 2018, the parties entered into an agreed temporary parenting plan.  In 
pertinent part, the parties agreed that they would care for the Children on an alternating 
weekly basis and agreed to the schools the Children would attend for the 2018-2019 school 
year.  The temporary parenting plan also ordered that each child would attend counseling 
regularly  with  Dr.  Mary  Wanat to  aid  during  this  transitional  period.    Lastly,  the  plan 
awarded the parties joint decision-making authority.

In August 2018, Judge Yolanda Kight was elected to the bench and replaced Judge 
David Rudolph who had presided over the case.  Due to a conflict involving Husband’s 
counsel, Judge Kight recused herself, and the case was reassigned to Judge Felicia Corbin-
Johnson.

On  October  18,  2018, the  trial  court heard,  inter  alia,  arguments  on  the  Entities’
motions to revise.  During the hearing, the trial judge questioned whether Wife’s amended 
complaint pleaded facts sufficient to  keep  the  Entities  as  defendants  in  the  litigation.  
Thereafter, on October 30, 2018, Wife filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint, 
seeking to add additional facts, see further discussion infra. 

By order of October 31, 2018, the trial court granted the Entities’ motions to revise 
and set a hearing on the motions to dismiss for that day.  Given Wife’s counsel’s statements
at this hearing, discussed further, infra, the trial court dismissed all Entities except for the 
DSW  Trust  #2.    Concerning  the  DSW Trust  #2,  the  trial  court  took  its  motion  under 
advisement  and  allowed  Wife  to  research  a  specific issue.    Thereafter,  Wife  and 
Cumberland  Trust  (on  behalf  of  the  DSW Trust  #2)  filed  supplemental  briefing  on  the
issue.    By  order  of  December  13,  2018,  the  trial  court  entered  an  order  dismissing  all 
Entities except for the DSW Trust #2.  

Also, on December 13, 2018, the trial court entered an agreed order modifying the 
scheduling order.  In pertinent part, the order provided that: (1) the deadline for Wife to 
produce  expert  reports  was  February  13,  2019;  (2)  the  deadline  for  Husband  and 
Cumberland  Trust  to  produce  expert  reports was  March  1,  2019;  (3)  the  deadline  to 
conclude  all  expert  depositions  was  on  or  before  April  15,  2019;  (4)  the  deadline  to 
- 4 -

conclude  the  deposition  of  a  Cumberland  Trust  representative  and  any  other  non-expert 
witness was on or before April 12, 2019; and (5) the final trial was set for May 29, 2019.

By order of January 20, 2019, the trial court entered an order dismissing the DSW 
Trust #2.  On January 23, 2019, Wife filed a motion to extend the expert deadlines, citing 
two reasons for the extension, i.e., (1) to allow for a hearing on Wife’s request for attorney’s 
fees;  and  (2) to  give  Wife  the  benefit  of  taking  Husband’s  deposition  before  the  expert 
deadline.  According to the motion, Wife’s deposition of December 11, 2018 took several 
days, and Wife had not yet deposed Husband.4

On  January  24,  2019,  Wife  produced an  additional 2,400  files  of  documents  to 
Husband’s counsel.    These  files  included  documents  related  to  the  Entities.    This 
production was the catalyst for contempt proceedings against Wife and the confiscation of 
Wife’s personal devices.  On February 4, 2019, Husband filed: (1) a motion for Rule 37 
sanctions  against  Wife;  and  (2)  a  petition  to  find  Wife  in  criminal  contempt  and  for 
injunctive relief.  That same day, the trial court held a hearing on Husband’s application 
for injunctive relief.  Thereafter, the trial court ordered Wife to turn over all documents 
that fell within the scope of the November 2017 orders by 5 p.m. that day.  The trial court 
also instructed Wife to turn over her personal devices, i.e., cell phone, laptop, iPad, camera,
to her counsel, which Wife did.  The trial court did not enter a written order until February 
11, 2019.  On February 7, 2019, the trial court held another hearing on Husband’s motion 
for injunctive relief.  

On  February  8,  2019,  the  trial  court  heard  Wife’s  motion  for  leave  to  amend  the 
complaint, wherein Wife sought to add the DSW Trust #2 back as a party to the divorce.  
The trial court took Wife’s motion under advisement.  On the same day, unbeknownst to 
her  counsel,  Wife  removed, from  her  counsel’s  office, the  personal  devices  she  had 
previously turned over.  

Due to Wife’s actions on February 8, on February 11, 2019, the trial court entered 
three orders against Wife.  In part, these orders enjoined Wife to turn all of her personal 
devices over to a third party, Insight Discovery (“Insight”) and provide Insight with all of 
her passwords.  That same day, Husband filed an amended petition to find Wife in contempt
and  added  a  civil  contempt  allegation.    Also,  on  that  day,  Wife’s  previous  counsel
announced that she was withdrawing as Wife’s counsel.  On February 13, 2019, the trial 
court entered an order on the preservation and retrieval of information from Wife’s devices 
and online storage accounts.  In part, this order required Wife’s counsel to make a privilege 
log concerning all data that Wife’s counsel received from Insight.  Although Wife’s current 
counsel had yet to file a formal notice of appearance (she did so on March 12, 2019), she 
signed the foregoing order.  On March 27, 2019, Wife filed a motion to set aside, modify, 
suspend, and/or stay the February 13, 2019 order concerning Wife’s devices.

                                           

4 The record shows that Wife never deposed Husband before trial.

Briefly, in a March 28, 2019, hearing, the trial court allowed Wife’s new counsel to 
file  “any  additional  arguments  that  [she  thought]  should  have  been  made  that  weren’t 
made”  concerning  Wife’s  motion  for  leave  to  amend  the  complaint.    On  April  2,  2019, 
Wife filed a revised and supplemental motion for leave to amend complaint and petition to 
set aside fraudulent transfer and to join third-party transferees, in which she alleged new 
factual allegations and legal claims.  On April 5, 2019, the trial court notified the parties
via email that it was denying Wife’s motion for leave to amend the complaint and that a 
written order would follow.

On  April  18,  2019,  Wife  filed  a  motion  to  compel  and/or  for  attorney’s  fees  and 
temporary support alleging that Husband was intentionally obstructing the conclusion of 
the temporary support hearing.  On May 3, 2019, Wife filed a motion to continue the May 
29, 2019 trial date, alleging, in part, that not a single issue had been resolved, discovery 
was  ongoing,  witness  lists  had  not  been  disclosed,  exhibit  lists  had  not  been  disclosed, 
depositions  had  either  not  been  completed  or had not  been  taken,  and  that  a  temporary 
support hearing had taken place over five days without a final adjudication.  Furthermore, 
Wife  alleged  that  she  had  not  had  time  to  prepare  for  the  final  trial  because  she  had  to 
defend herself in the pending contempt proceedings.  

From  May  8 through  10,  2019,  the  trial  court  began  the  hearing  on Husband’s 
petition  to  hold  Wife  in  contempt.   Also,  on May  10,  2019,  the  trial  court  heard Wife’s 
motion to set aside the February 13, 2019 order concerning Wife’s devices, Wife’s motion 
for a continuance, and Wife’s motion to compel concerning attorney’s fees and temporary 
support.  The trial court orally denied Wife’s motion to set aside and denied in part and 
granted in part her motion for attorney’s fees and temporary support.  The trial court also 
orally denied Wife’s request for a continuance.  Also, on this day, the trial court entered a 
sua  sponte  order compelling  the  turnover  of  company and  trust  property  and  the 
appointment  of  a  Special  Master.    This  order  instructed  the  Special  Master  to  contact 
individuals  who  might  have  had property  belonging  to  the  Entities  and  to  index  such 
property.

On May 15, 2019, Wife filed an answer to Husband’s counter-complaint for divorce.  
The trial court resumed the contempt proceedings on May 15, and on May 16, 2019, the 
trial court orally ruled that it would not find Wife in contempt.  

On May  22,  2019,  the  trial  court  entered  an  order  denying  Wife’s  motion  for  a 
continuance.  That same day, the trial court also entered its written order denying Wife’s 
motion for leave to amend the complaint.  Additionally, on May 22, 2019, the trial court 
entered an order denying in part and granting in part Wife’s motion to compel and/or for 
attorney fees and temporary support.  

Also,  on  May  22,  2019,  Husband  filed  a  motion  in  limine (the  “first  motion  in 

- 6 -

limine”) to exclude testimony from Wife’s expert witnesses.  On May 25 and 27, 2019, 
Wife’s  counsel emailed  Husband’s  counsel with  a  “working  witness  list  for  trial.”  
Thereafter, on May 28, 2019, Husband filed a second motion in limine (the “second motion 
in limine) to exclude the testimony of witnesses Wife revealed four days before trial.  By 
order  of  May  29,  2019,  the  trial  court  granted  Husband’s  first  motion  in  limine and 
excluded testimony from Wife’s expert witnesses.  That same day, the final trial began. 

On May 30, 2019, the trial court entered an order denying Husband’s petitions for 
civil and criminal contempt.  By order of June 4, 2019, the trial court granted Husband’s 
second  motion  in  limine,  which  resulted  in  several  of  Wife’s  other  witnesses  being 
excluded from testifying.

The trial court held the final trial on May 29, 30, 31, June 3, 27, 28, and July 1, 2, 3
(ending  in  the  early  hours  of  July  4), 2019.    The  following  witnesses  testified:  (1)  Ms. 
Alison Kosman, Wife’s former assistant; (2) Ms. Nicole Beers who was hired before the 
divorce to help with the Children; (3) Dr. Mary Wanat, Ph.D., the Children’s psychologist; 
(4) Wife; (5) Dr. David Strauser, Husband’s vocational expert; (6) Husband; (7) Mr. Robert 
Vance, CPA, Husband’s expert and a forensic certified public accountant and economist; 
(8) Mr. Richard Smith, Husband’s friend; and (9) the Children.  125 exhibits were entered 
into  evidence.    The  trial  court  held  additional  hearings  on  August  14  and  15,  2019,  and 
September 11, 2019.  

On September 11, 2019, the trial court entered the final decree of divorce, which 
incorporated the trial court’s findings of facts and conclusions of law and the permanent 
parenting  plan.    The  trial  court  also  entered  the  permanent  parenting  plan separately.  
Relevant  here  and  discussed  at  length,  infra,  the  trial  court:  (1)  granted  Husband  final 
decision-making authority and named him the primary residential parent for both Children; 
(2)  awarded  Wife  $3,200  per  month  in  child  support until  Easton  reached  majority
(thereafter  Wife  would  receive  $2,100  per  month  in  child  support until  Saylor  reached 
majority); (3) awarded Wife $15,810.50 in transitional alimony for 66 months; (4) denied 
Wife’s  request  for  retroactive temporary support;  and  (5)  denied  Wife’s  request  for 
attorney’s fees.

After  entering  the  final  decree  and  parenting  plan,  the  trial  court  heard  post-trial 
issues related to the Special Master and the trial court’s May 10, 2019 sua sponte order.

We  review  a  non-jury  case  “de  novo upon  the  record  with  a  presumption  of 
correctness  as  to  the  findings  of  fact,  unless  the  preponderance  of  the  evidence  is 
otherwise.”  Bowden v. Ward, 27 S.W.3d 913, 916 (Tenn. 2000) (citing Tenn. R. App. P. 
13(d)).  The trial court’s conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and “are accorded no 
presumption of correctness.”  Brunswick Acceptance Co., LLC v. MEJ, LLC, 292 S.W.3d 
638, 642 (Tenn. 2008).  Given the number of issues raised in this appeal, where a standard
of review differs from that set out above, we will discuss it under the issue heading.

IV.  Analysis

In  the  interest  of  judicial  economy,  we  have  grouped  Wife’s  issues  into the 
following 7 categories: (1) issues regarding the Entities; (2) issues concerning injunctions 
and Wife’s electronic devices; (3) pre-trial procedural issues; (4) evidence related to assets 
in trust; (5) issues concerning the Children; (6) Wife’s support; and (7) Wife’s attorney’s 
fees.  

A.  Issues Regarding the Entities

As set out above, two of Wife’s issues concern the Entities.  Wife first argues that 
the trial court erred when it granted the Entities’ respective motions to revise and when it 
dismissed the Entities as defendants.  As discussed further below, our review of these issues
is limited to Wife’s claims concerning the DSW Trust #2 because she waived her claims
as to the other entities.  Wife also raises an issue concerning the trial court’s denial of her
motion for leave to amend the complaint and her revised and supplemental motion for leave 
to amend and petition to set aside fraudulent transfer and to join third-party transferees.

1.  Wife Waived Her Claims Concerning all Entities Except the DSW Trust #27

Although Wife originally sought to include all of the Entities as defendants in the 
divorce action, she expressly abandoned most of these claims during litigation.  Turning to 
the record, on October 31, 2018, after the trial court granted the Entities’ motions to revise, 
it held a hearing on the Entities’ motions to dismiss.  In that hearing, Wife’s counsel stated: 
“What  I  think  is  reasonable  under  the  circumstances  is  certainly  to  dismiss  the  entities 
except for [the] DSW [Trust #]2.”  When the trial court asked Wife’s counsel if the other 
                                           
addressed  in  this  Brief  pertain  to  AMWJR  and/or  W&A  LLC,  Appellees  incorporate  by  reference  the 
arguments and defenses on such issues as stated in the Brief of the Appellees Waddell Trust, DSW Trust, 
and DSW Trust #2 and Brief of the Appellee David Sewall Waddell as if stated fully herein.”

7 Sections (IV)(A)(1)-(3) address Wife’s first issue: “Did the trial court err in granting Appellees’ 
Motion to Revise and thereafter dismissing Waddell and Associates, LLC, Waddell and Associates, Inc., 
Waddell Trust, DSW Trust, and DSW Trust #2 as Defendants in the divorce case?”

- 9 -

entities  would  be  dismissed  “by  lack  of  opposition,”  Wife’s  counsel confirmed.  
Accordingly, the trial court ruled:

The  [c]ourt  is  going  to  dismiss,  after  considering  all  of  the  motions,  the 
memorandums,  the  arguments  of  counsel,  statements  of  [Wife’s  counsel] 
today  that  she  is  not  in  opposition  considering  the  [c]ourt’s  desire  to  .  .  . 
streamline the case and for judicial economy, Waddell and Associates, LLC; 
Waddell  and  Associates,  Inc.;  Waddell  Trust  and  .  .  .  DSW  Trust  will  be 
dismissed.

Although  the  trial  court  took  the  DSW  Trust #2’s  dismissal  under  advisement,  it later 
dismissed that entity as well.  At the February 8, 2019 hearing on Wife’s motion for leave
to amend the complaint, Wife’s counsel reiterated that she was not seeking to bring all of 
the dismissed Entities back into the lawsuit, to-wit:

So we have filed our motion to amend.  The only difference . . . is that we 
are not asking to add back all those parties.  The only party that we are asking 
back, which frankly is the benefit of the discovery that we’ve been doing all 
these months, is that now we understand that DSW [Trust#] 2 is now the one 
that holds the assets which are at issue. 

From the foregoing statements, Wife clearly and unequivocally waived her right to pursue 
claims against W&A, LLC, AMWJR, Inc. (f/k/a W&A, Inc), the Waddell Trust, and the 
DSW Trust as defendants in the lawsuit.  “It is well settled that issues not raised at the trial 
level are considered waived on appeal.”  Moses v. Dirghangi, 430 S.W.3d 371, 381 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. 2013) (citing Waters v. Farr, 291 S.W.3d 873, 918 (Tenn. 2009)); see also Duke 
v. Duke, 563 S.W.3d 885, 898 n.2 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2018).  The policy behind this decree is 
that  relief  should  not  be  granted  to  a  party  “who  failed  to  take  whatever  action  was 
reasonably available to prevent or nullify the harmful effect of an error.”  Tenn. R. App. P. 
36.  This same principle applies when a party raises an issue but then expressly abandons 
it at the trial level.  See Carroll v. Morgan Cnty. Bd. of Educ., No. E2017-00038-COA-
R3-CV,  2017  WL  5712903,  at  *3  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Nov.  28,  2017)  (holding  that  the 
plaintiff’s attorney’s express declaration to the trial court that the plaintiff was not pursuing 
an issue resulted in the waiver and abandonment of the plaintiff’s right to raise that issue 
on  appeal).    Because  Wife  failed  “to  take  whatever  action  was  reasonably  available  to 
prevent . . . the harmful error,” i.e., Wife expressly abandoned her claims against W&A, 
LLC, AMWJR, Inc. (f/k/a W&A, Inc), the Waddell Trust, and the DSW Trust, she cannot 
complain on appeal that the trial court erred in dismissing these entities.  Accordingly, our 
review is limited to the trial court’s orders granting the DSW Trust #2’s motions to revise 
and dismiss.  We turn to those issues.

2.  Grant of the DSW Trust #2’s Motion to Revise

- 10 -

As  discussed  briefly,  supra,  the  trial  court  initially  denied  the  DSW  Trust  #2’s 
motion to dismiss.  Thereafter, the DSW Trust #2 filed a motion to revise and asked the 
trial court to amend its order denying the motion to dismiss.  Alternatively, the DSW Trust 
#2 sought interlocutory appeal of the trial court’s order denying its motion to dismiss.  In 
the motion to revise, the DSW Trust #2 argued that the trial court committed an error of 
law by allowing the trust to remain as a party to the lawsuit.  Specifically, the DSW Trust 
#2 argued that: (1) Wife failed to allege facts sufficient to support any claims against the 
DSW Trust #2; (2) the governing trust agreement precluded Wife’s claims against the DSW 
Trust  #2  as  a  matter  of  law;  and  (3)  the  DSW  Trust  #2’s  presence  as  a  party  was  not 
necessary for Wife to obtain complete relief in the divorce proceeding.  While the DSW 
Trust #2’s motion to revise was pending, the case was transferred to Judge Corbin-Johnson.

A  motion to revise concerns interlocutory orders rather than final judgments.  As 

such, it falls under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 54.02, which provides that

any order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates
fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the
parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and
the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before
the entry of the judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and
liabilities of all the parties.

Tenn.  R.  Civ.  P.  54.02(1)  (emphasis  added);  see  also  Tenn.  R.  App.  P.  3(a) (emphasis 
added) (“[A]ny order that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities
of fewer than all the parties is not enforceable or appealable and is subject to revision at
any time before entry of a final judgment adjudicating all the claims, rights, and liabilities
of all parties.”); see also Discover Bank v. Morgan, 363 S.W.3d 479, 488 (Tenn. 2012)
(“[M]otions  seeking  relief  from  a  trial  court’s  decision  adjudicating  fewer  than  all  the 
claims, rights, and liabilities of all the parties, should be filed pursuant to Rule 54.02.”).  
Because  interlocutory  orders  are  “subject  to  revision  at  any  time  before  the  entry  of  the 
[final]  judgment,”  Tenn.  R.  Civ.  P.  54.02(1),  Rule  54.02 allows  litigants  “a  limited 
opportunity  to  readdress  previously  determined  issues  and  afford[s] trial  courts  an 
opportunity to revisit and reverse their own decisions.”  Harris v. Chern, 33 S.W.3d 741, 
744  (Tenn.  2000).    Indeed,  Rule 54.02 “confers  upon  the  trial  court  ‘the  privilege  of 
reversing itself up to and including the date of entry of a final judgment.’”  Id. (quoting
Louis Dreyfus Corp. v. Austin Co., 868 S.W.2d 649, 653 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993)).  

This  Court  reviews  a  trial  court’s  ruling  on  a motion  to  revise  under  an  abuse  of 
discretion standard.  Harris, 33 S.W.3d at 746 (citing Donnelly v. Walter, 959 S.W.2d 166, 
168 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997)); see also Discover Bank, 363 S.W.3d at 487.  As the Tennessee 
Supreme Court has explained, 

- 11 -

The  abuse  of  discretion  standard  does  not  allow  the  appellate  court to 
substitute its judgment for that of the trial court, Williams v. Baptist Mem'l
Hosp., 193  S.W.3d  545,  551  (Tenn. 2006); Myint v. Allstate Ins. Co., 970 
S.W.2d 920, 927 (Tenn. 1998), and we will find an abuse of discretion only 
if  the  court  “applied  incorrect  legal  standards,  reached  an  illogical 
conclusion,  based  its  decision  on  a  clearly  erroneous  assessment  of  the 
evidence, or employ[ed] reasoning that causes an injustice to the complaining 
party.” Konvalinka v. Chattanooga-Hamilton Cnty. Hosp. Auth., 249 
S.W.3d  346,  358  (Tenn. 2008); see also Lee Med., Inc. v. Beecher, 312 
S.W.3d 515, 524 (Tenn. 2010).

Wright ex rel. Wright v. Wright, 337 S.W.3d 166, 176 (Tenn. 2011).

In granting the motion to revise, the trial court recognized that it had the discretion 
to revisit any previous interlocutory order.  The trial court found that it should revisit the 
motion to dismiss, in pertinent part, because: (1) it may have been error to keep the DSW 
Trust #2 in as a party to the case; (2) it was in the parties’ best interests for the trial court 
to review the motion to dismiss before considering whether to grant the DSW Trust #2’s 
interlocutory  appeal as  appeals  are  often  financially  burdensome;  (3)  the  trial  court’s 
revisiting of the motion to dismiss would not prejudice either party; and (4) because the 
trial court inherited the case after the motion to dismiss was decided, justice would best be 
served by having the current trial judge review the motion.  

On appeal, Wife argues that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard when 
it  granted  the  motion  to  revise  and  that  its order  should  be  vacated.    However,  in  her 
appellate brief, Wife relies on an incorrect statement of the law.  Specifically, Wife argues 
that 

[b]ecause the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  has  ruled  that  a  motion  to  revisit 
under Rule 54.02 should be analyzed under the framework for a Rule 59.04 
motion to alter or amend, the trial court may grant a motion to revisit only: 
(1) when the controlling law has changed before a judgment becomes final; 
(2) when previously unavailable evidence becomes available; or (3) when, in 
unique  circumstances,  the  judgment  should  be  amended  to  correct  a  clear 
error of law or to prevent injustice.  Harris, 33 S.W.3d 741.

Because  the  trial  court  did  not  rely  on  the  above  elements  when  granting  the  motion  to 
revise, Wife argues that it abused its discretion.

Although  Wife  cites  “Harris,  33  S.W.3d  741”  for  her  appellate  argument,  her 
statement of the law and citation, supra, are inaccurate.  In Harris, the Tennessee Supreme 
Court  addressed  the  standard  trial  courts  should  apply  “[w]hen  additional  evidence  is 
submitted  in  support  of  a  Rule  54.02  motion  to  revise  a  grant  of  summary  judgment[.]”  
- 12 -

Harris,  33  S.W.3d  at  745.   Because  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  there 
was no Tennessee case law regarding the standard a trial court should apply in ruling on a 
Rule 54.02 motion to revise, it looked to Rule 59.04 to “offer some guidance in determining 
the standard for revising non-final orders.”  Id. at 744.  In so doing, the Tennessee Supreme 
Court  acknowledged  both  the  similarities  and  differences  between  Rule  54.02  and  Rule 
59.04.  It continued by analyzing two cases, Bradley v. McLeod, 984 S.W.2d 929 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. 1998), and Schaefer v. Larsen, 688 S.W.2d 430 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984), both of 
which applied Rule 59.04 with differing results.  Harris, 33 S.W.3d at 744.  Relevant here, 
in  Bradley,  this  Court  opined  that  Rule  59.04  motions  may  be  granted  under  the  three 
circumstances  cited  by  Wife  above.    See  Bradley,  984  S.W.2d  at  933.    Indeed,  Wife’s 
appellate brief quotes Bradley almost verbatim but cites to Harris for support.  Importantly, 
in  Harris, 
“neither 
Schaefer nor Bradley adequately  addresse[d] both  imperatives  as  regards  Rule  54.02 
motions  to  revise  when  additional  evidence  is  submitted  to  overcome  a  grant  of  partial 
summary judgment.”  Harris, 33 S.W.3d at 745.  In reaching this conclusion, the Tennessee 
Supreme  Court  set  out new  elements  for  trial  courts  to  consider  when  presented  with 
additional  evidence  in  support  of  a  Rule  54.02  motion  to  revise  a  grant  of  summary 
judgment.  Id.  On this Court’s review, the Harris Court did not “rule[] that a motion to 
revisit under Rule 54.02 should be analyzed under the framework for a Rule 59.04 motion 
to alter or amend[,]” nor did the Harris Court hold that a trial court may grant a motion to 
revise only when one of the three elements cited by Wife applies.  Accordingly, Wife’s 
reliance on Rule 59.04 and the above cited elements is misplaced.  

Supreme  Court

concluded

the 

Contrary  to  Wife’s  arguments,  the  trial  court  did  not  apply  an  incorrect  legal 
standard.  As discussed, supra, under Rule 54.02, a trial court has discretion to revisit any 
interlocutory orders before entry of a final judgment.  Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.02(1); see also 
Tenn. R. App. P. 3(a).  Rule 54.02 grants trial courts such discretion for the exact reason 
articulated by the trial court during the hearing on the motion to revise, i.e., to “get [the 
issue] right.”  The record shows that the trial court reviewed both the motion to revise and 
the underlying  motion to dismiss in preparation for the hearing on the  motion to revise.  
The trial court expressed concern that requiring the DSW Trust #2 to remain in the case 
may have been error, and the trial court wanted to revisit this issue to prevent any legal 
error or injustice to both the parties and the DSW Trust #2.  Such action was well within 
the trial court’s discretion.  Having determined that the trial court did not err in granting 
the  motion  to  revise,  we  now  turn  to  review  its  grant  of  the  DSW  Trust  #2’s  motion  to 
dismiss.

3.  Grant of the DSW Trust #2’s Motion to Dismiss8

                                           

8 In this portion of her appellate brief, Wife makes a two-page argument that the trial court “abused 
its discretion in failing to fully consider Wife’s [m]otion for [l]eave to [a]mend prior to granting Appellees’ 
[m]otion to dismiss.”  This is a separate issue from whether the trial court erred when it granted the DSW 
Trust #2’s motion to revise and motion to dismiss, and it is an issue that Wife did not list in her statement 
of the issues for appeal.  The contents of appellate briefs are governed by Rule 27 of the Tennessee Rules 
- 13 -

A motion to dismiss challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint rather than the 
strength of the plaintiff’s proof or evidence.  Phillips v. Montgomery Cnty., 442 S.W.3d 
233, 237 (Tenn. 2014) (quoting Webb v. Nashville Area Habitat for Humanity, Inc., 346 
S.W.3d 422, 426 (Tenn. 2011)).  “In analyzing the legal sufficiency of the complaint, we 
must  presume  that  all  factual  allegations  in  the  complaint  are  true  and  construe  them  in 
favor of the plaintiff.”  Foster v. Chiles, 467 S.W.3d 911, 914 (Tenn. 2015) (citing Lind v. 
Beaman Dodge, Inc., 356 S.W.3d 889, 894 (Tenn. 2011) (citing Stein v. Davidson Hotel 
Co.,  945  S.W.2d  714,  716  (Tenn.1997))).    “A  trial  court  should  grant  a  motion  to 
dismiss ‘only when it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the
claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.’” Runyon v. Zacharias, 556 S.W.3d 732, 
737 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2018) (emphasis in original) (quoting Webb, 346 S.W.3d at 426).  We 
review  a  motion  to  dismiss  de  novo with  no  presumption  of  correctness.    See  Myers  v. 
AMISUB (SFH), Inc., 382 S.W.3d 300, 307 (Tenn. 2012).

Although “[a] complaint ‘need not contain detailed allegations of all the facts giving 
rise to the claim,’ [] it ‘must contain sufficient factual allegations to articulate a claim for 
relief.’”  Webb, 346 S.W.3d at 427 (quoting Abshure v. Methodist Healthcare-Memphis
Hospitals, 325 S.W.3d 98, 103-04 (Tenn. 2010)).  “‘The facts pleaded, and the inferences 
reasonably  drawn  from  these  facts,  must  raise  the  pleader’s  right  to  relief  beyond  the 
speculative  level.’”    Webb,  346  S.W.3d  at  427  (quoting  Abshure,  325  S.W.3d  at  104).  
Furthermore,  “courts  are  not  required  to  accept  as  true  assertions  that  are  merely  legal 
arguments or ‘legal conclusions’ couched as facts.”  Runyon, 556 S.W.3d at 737 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. 2018) (citing Webb, 346 S.W.3d at 427) (quoting Riggs v. Burson, 941 S.W.2d 
44, 47-48 (Tenn. 1997)).  

Turning to Wife’s September 5, 2017 amended complaint, she alleged the following 

concerning the DSW Trust #2:

                                           
of Appellate Procedure, which requires an appellant’s brief to list “[a] statement of the issues presented for 
review . . . .”  Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(4).  The statement of the issues is vitally important to the appeal as it 
provides  this  Court  with  the  questions  that  we  are  asked  to  answer  on  review.    The  statement  is  also 
significant because our “[a]ppellate review is generally limited” to those issues listed in it.  Hodge v. Craig, 
382 S.W.3d 325, 334 (Tenn. 2012) (citing Tenn. R. App. P. 13(b)).  Indeed, “[c]ourts have consistently 
held that . . . [a]n issue  not included [in the statement of the issues] is  not properly before the Court of 
Appeals.”  Hawkins v. Hart, 86 S.W.3d 522, 531 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001).  Accordingly, appellants should 
endeavor to frame each issue “as specifically as the nature of the error will permit,” Hodge, 382 S.W.3d at 
335 (citing Fahey v. Eldridge, 46 S.W.3d 138, 143-44 (Tenn. 2001); State v. Williams, 914 S.W.2d 940, 
948 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995)), as this Court is not required to “search[] for hidden questions” in appellants’ 
briefs.  Hodge, 382 S.W.3d at 334 (citing Bryan A. Garner, Garner on Language and Writing 115 (2009); 
Robert  L.  Stern, Appellate Practice in the United States §  10.9,  at  263  (2d  ed.1989)).   Having  failed  to 
include as an issue  whether the trial court erred when it granted the DSW Trust #2’s motion to dismiss 
before fully considering Wife’s motion for leave to amend the complaint, Wife has waived this issue.

6.  Rule 19.01 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure provides as follows: 
A person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party if (1) 
in  the  person’s  absence  complete  relief  cannot  be  accorded  among  those 
already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of 
the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person’s 
absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person’s ability to 
protect that interest, or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to 
a  substantial  risk  of  incurring  double,  multiple,  or  otherwise  inconsistent 
obligations by reasons of the claimed interest.  If the person has not been so 
joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party.  If the person 
properly should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he or she may be made 
a defendant, or in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.

7. Wife hereby amends her Complaint and adds Waddell & Associates, LLC, 
Waddell & Associates, Inc., Waddell Trust, DSW Trust, and DSW Trust #2 
as additional Defendants in this cause.

***

12. Defendant, DSW Trust #2, is a Tennessee trust. Such Party Defendant is
joined  in  this  cause  to  bring  it  within  the  jurisdiction  and  control  of  this 
[c]ourt.  The Defendant  Trust  holds  assets  and  monies  that  are  marital  in 
nature and in which assets Wife seeks an equitable interest and division. The 
trustee  for  said  trust  is  Cumberland Trust  .  .  .  .  The  parties  have  made 
substantial contributions to the value of the trust during the marriage.

13.  Wife hereby joins . . . DSW Trust #2 as Defendant[] in this cause.

In the amended complaint, Wife also asked that she “receive an equitable distribution of 
any and all marital assets held by . . . [the] DSW Trust #2.”  

By order of January 29, 2019, the trial court granted the DSW Trust #2’s motion to 
dismiss.    In  dismissing  the  trust  without  prejudice,  the  trial  court  found  that  Wife’s 
amended complaint failed to: (1) identify or state a cause of action against the DSW Trust 
#2; (2) state a claim upon which relief could be granted; and (3) sufficiently allege that the 
DSW Trust #2 was a Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 19.01 party.  

From the amended complaint, this Court, like the trial court, struggles to understand 
the nature of Wife’s claim(s) for relief against the DSW Trust #2, i.e., how the DSW Trust 
#2 injured Wife such that she could maintain a cause of action against the trust.  On our 
review, Wife pleaded no facts to allege that she was harmed by the DSW Trust #2.  Rather, 
it appears that the focus of Wife’s argument in opposition to the motion to dismiss was that 
the DSW Trust #2 was a necessary party under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 
- 15 -

19.01.  Briefly, Rule 19.01 governs the joinder of indispensable and necessary parties.  In 
pertinent  part,  it  provides  that  “[a] person  who  is  subject  to  service  of  process  shall  be 
joined as a party if . . . in the person’s absence complete relief cannot be accorded among 
those already parties[.]”  Tenn. R. Civ. P. 19.01.  In the trial court, Wife argued that, without 
the  DSW  Trust  #2, equitable  and  complete  relief  in  the  divorce  would  be  precluded 
because, as Wife asserted, the DSW Trust #2 contained marital property subject to division 
by the trial court.  Returning to the amended complaint, Wife’s allegations that the DSW 
Trust  #2  held  assets  that  were  “marital  in  nature,”  and  that  the  parties  made  substantial 
contributions to the trust during marriage were no more than legal arguments, which the 
trial court was not required to accept as true.  See Runyon, 556 S.W.3d at 737.  Indeed, 
Wife failed to plead any factual allegations concerning what marital assets the DSW Trust 
#2 held and/or how the DSW Trust #2 came to hold such assets.  As such, Wife’s amended 
complaint failed to plead allegations sufficient to show that the DSW Trust #2 held marital 
assets and/or was a necessary party to the divorce.  Webb, 346 S.W.3d at 427.  Accordingly, 
we affirm the trial court’s dismissal of the DSW Trust #2 because the amended complaint 
failed  to:  (1) state a  claim upon  which  relief  could  have  been  granted against the  DSW 
Trust  #2;  and  (2)  failed  to  allege  sufficient  facts  to  show  that the  DSW  Trust  #2  was  a 
necessary party under Rule 19.01.

4.  Wife’s Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint and Wife’s Revised and 
Supplemental Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint and Petition to Set Aside 
Fraudulent Transfer and to Join Third-Party Transferees9

Wife appeals the trial court’s denial of both her October 30, 2018 motion for leave 
to amend the complaint, and her April 2, 2019 revised and supplemental motion for leave 
to amend and petition to set aside fraudulent  transfer and to join third-party  transferees.  
We note that, although filed as one pleading, Wife separates her April 2, 2019 pleading 
into a: (1) revised and supplemental motion for leave to amend; and (2) petition to set aside 
fraudulent transfer and to join third-party transferees.  Given our conclusion on this issue, 
there is no need to address Wife’s separation of this pleading.

On appeal, Wife does not argue that the trial court erred in its substantive denials of 
her motions.  Rather, Wife’s entire appellate argument is premised on her allegation that 
the trial court refused to “fully consider” the motions.  Specifically, in her appellate brief, 
Wife alleges that the trial court “acted arbitrarily in depriving Wife of her right to present 
her claims” because “[a]t no point did the [t]rial [c]ourt hold a hearing on either Wife’s . . 
. motion for leave to amend complaint for absolute divorce or her revised and supplemental 
motion for leave to amend.”  This Court is perplexed by Wife’s argument concerning the 
motion for leave to amend the complaint as it is clear from the record that the trial court 

                                           

9 This section addresses Wife’s second issue: “Did the trial court err in denying Wife’s Motion to 
Amend and her Revised and Supplemental Motion for Leave to Amend and Petition to Set Aside Fraudulent 
Conveyance and to Join Third Parties?”

- 16 -

dedicated  significant  time  and  effort  to  deciding  the  motion.    Turning  to  the  record,  on 
February 8, 2019, the trial court held a hearing on Wife’s motion for leave to amend the 
complaint.  During the hearing, the trial court engaged in a lengthy discussion with Wife’s 
counsel before taking the motion under advisement.  When Wife retained new counsel, the 
trial court allowed Wife’s new counsel to file supplemental briefing on the motion for leave 
to amend the complaint.  Rather than file supplemental briefing, on April 2, 2019, Wife 
chose to file a new motion with extensive new allegations.  Regardless of whether the April 
2,  2019  filing  was  one  motion  or  two,  the  record  is  clear  that  Wife  never  set  this/these 
motion(s) for a hearing; it was her burden to do so if she wanted the trial court to hear the 
motion(s).  Although, on the day before trial began, Wife requested that the trial court hear 
the petition to set aside fraudulent transfer concurrently with the divorce, it was not error 
for the trial court to deny such request on the eve of trial.  Indeed, the trial court noted that 
Wife failed to secure a fiat so that the petition could be heard and proper notice given to all 
parties.    The  trial  court  concluded  that,  to  the  extent  the  petition  was  separate from  the 
motion, the petition was untimely and improper because it had not been set and notice had 
not been given to the parties named in the petition.10  Given the foregoing, the record does 
not support Wife’s arguments that the trial court failed to “fully consider” the motion for 
leave to amend the complaint or the revised and supplemental motion for leave to amend 
and petition to set aside fraudulent transfer and to join third-party transferees.  

Despite  Wife’s  failure  to  brief  the  substantive  issue,  given  the  importance  of  the 
October 30, 2018 motion for leave to amend the complaint and the effect its denial had on 
the  outcome  of  this  case,  we  address  the  trial  court’s  substantive  holding  that  Wife’s 
proposed amendments in the 2018 motion for leave to amend the complaint would have 
been  futile.    See Owen v. Long Tire, LLC,  No.  W2011-01227-COA-R3-CV,  2011  WL 
6777014, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 2011) (“We recognize that there are times when 
this Court, in the discretion afforded it under Rule 2 of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate 
Procedure, may waive the briefing requirements to adjudicate the issues on their merits.”).  

                                           

10 At  the  pre-trial  hearing  the  day  before  trial  began,  Wife’s  counsel  argued  that  the  trial  court 
previously considered and denied the revised and supplemental motion in its May 22, 2019 amended order 
denying Wife’s motion for leave to amend complaint for absolute divorce.  In that hearing, the trial court 
clarified that it had neither heard nor ruled on Wife’s April 2, 2019 revised and supplemental motion and 
petition to set aside.  The trial court also clarified that it treated the revised and supplemental motion and 
petition to set aside as one filing.  In their appellate briefs, Husband and the Trusts also rely on the trial 
court’s May 22, 2019 order to show that the trial court ruled on both the revised and supplemental motion
and the petition to set aside.  On our review, the order did not dispose of the foregoing motion/petition.  
Indeed,  in the  order, the trial court explicitly found that it “did  not consider this new pleading  with the 
pending  motion  for  leave  currently  under  advisement  for  ruling.”    The  trial  court  further  found  that  it 
“advised Wife and Husband’s attorneys that the [c]ourt did not consider the supplemental motion filed on 
April 2, 2019, but the [c]ourt would likely deny it on other grounds for repeated failure to cure deficiencies.”  
Emphasis added.  The trial court then noted that “Wife has never set her revised and supplemental motion 
to be heard[.]”  Accordingly, we conclude that Wife’s revised and supplemental motion and petition to set 
aside was denied  in the final decree  of absolute divorce, wherein the trial court held that “[a]ll pending 
petitions and motions filed in this case that have not been heard are hereby denied[.]”

We review a trial court’s decision concerning a motion for leave to amend under an abuse 
of discretion standard.  Merriman v. Smith, 599 S.W.2d 548, 559 (Tenn. App. 1979). 

Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 15.01 governs amended pleadings.  Under 
Rule  15.01,  if  a  responsive  pleading  has  already  been  served,  “a  party  may  amend  the 
party’s  pleadings  only  by  written  consent  of  the adverse  party  or  by  leave  of  court;  and 
leave  shall  be  freely  given  when  justice  so  requires.”    Tenn.  R.  Civ.  P.  15.01.    The 
Tennessee  Supreme  Court  has  “emphasized  the  liberality  of  this  rule  where  pre-trial 
amendments are sought and noted that Rule 15.01 substantially lessened the exercise  of 
pre-trial discretion on the part of the trial judge.”  Gardiner v. Word, 731 S.W.2d 889, 891 
(Tenn. 1987) (citing Branch v. Warren, 527 S.W.2d 89 (Tenn. 1975)).  However, leave to 
amend is not mandatory and is sometimes unwarranted.  The factors courts should weigh 
in  considering  a  motion  for  leave  to  amend  include:  (1)  undue  delay  in  filing  the 
amendment; (2) lack of notice to the opposing party; (3) bad faith by the moving party; (4) 
repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments; (5) undue prejudice to the 
opposing party; and (6) futility of the amendment.  Merriman, 599 S.W.2d at 559.  The 
sole  factor  the  trial  court  considered  in  denying  Wife’s  motion  for  leave  to  amend  the 
complaint was futility.  Accordingly, we turn to review whether allowing Wife’s proposed 
second amended complaint would have been futile. 

From  what  this  Court  can  deduce  from  hearing  transcripts  and  Wife’s  pleadings, 
Wife sought to add the DSW Trust #2 as a Rule 19.01 necessary party on the allegation 
that it held marital assets, and a court order concerning such assets would be enforceable 
only if the trust was a party to the divorce case.  Specifically, Wife alleged that, through 
the  Focus  Transaction,  Focus  purchased  Husband’s  book  of  business,  the  use  of  the 
Waddell  name,  and  Husband’s  community  reputation.    Wife  further  alleged  that  the 
compensation  for  such  “items”  was  placed  into  the  DSW  Trust  #2.    The  following 
amendments in the proposed second amended complaint concern this allegation: 

14. On April 1, 2016, the parties engaged in the Focus Transaction.

15.  Focus  Financial  Partners, LLC  purchased  Husband’s  ongoing 
relationships with his clients.

16.  Focus  Financial  Partners,  LLC  purchased  Husband’s  professional 
network.

17.  Focus  Financial  Partners,  LLC  purchased  Husband’s  community 
reputation.

18.  Focus  Financial  Partners,  LLC  purchased  the  right  to  use  Husband’s 
name.

- 18 -

19. The compensation for the items listed in paragraphs 15, 16, 17, and 18
was placed in DSW Trust #2.

33. Waddell & Associates, Inc. is referred to as the Seller in the Contribution 
Purchase Agreement involved in the Focus Transaction.

***

***

37.  The  assets  purchased  by  Focus  Financial  Partners,  LLC  such  as 
Husband’s  book  of  business  and  personal,  professional,  and  enterprise 
goodwill were marital assets.

Based on Wife’s allegations in the proposed second amended complaint: (1) W&A, Inc. 
was  the  seller  in  the  Focus  Transaction  (paragraph  33);  (2)  W&A,  Inc.  sold  Husband’s 
ongoing relationship with his clients, his professional network, his community reputation, 
and  the  right  to  use  his  name  (paragraphs  33;  15-18);  (3)  these  assets  amounted  to 
Husband’s  personal,  professional,  and  enterprise  goodwill  and  were  marital  assets 
(paragraph 37); and (4) compensation for the foregoing was placed into the DSW Trust #2 
(paragraph 19).  

As an initial matter, Wife’s proposed second amended complaint alleged that W&A, 
Inc.,  not  Husband, was  the  seller  in  the  Focus  Transaction.    As  such,  by  Wife’s  own 
allegations,  W&A,  Inc.,  not  Husband,  would  be  entitled  to  compensation  from  the 
transaction.    However,  for  completeness, we  address  Wife’s  allegation in  the  proposed 
second amended complaint that “Husband’s book of business and personal, professional, 
and enterprise goodwill were marital assets.”  

Goodwill  is  an  intangible  asset.    McKee v. McKee,  No.  M2009-01502-COA-R3-
CV, 2010 WL 3245246, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 2010).  The nature of the goodwill 
determines whether it could be considered a marital asset subject to division on divorce.  
“Personal” or “professional” goodwill, as the name suggests, belongs to the individual.  It 
is  the  “[g]oodwill  attributable  to  an  individual’s  skills,  knowledge,  efforts,  training,  or 
reputation in making a business successful.”  Goodwill, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (11th 
ed.  2019).    It  is  well-settled  in  Tennessee  that  personal  goodwill  is  not  a  marital  asset.  
McKee,  2010  WL  3245246,  at  *3;  Cunningham v. Cunningham, No.  W1999-02054-
COA-R3-CV,  2000  WL  33191364,  at  *3  (Tenn. Ct. App.  Oct. 20,  2000); Smith v.
Smith, 709  S.W.2d  588,  592  (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985)  (“[P]rofessional goodwill  is  not  a 
marital  asset  which  would  be  accounted  for  in  making  an  equitable  distribution  of  the 
marital estate.”).  “Enterprise” or “business” goodwill belongs to an enterprise or business.  
Included  in  this  goodwill  is  “[a]  business’s  reputation, patronage,  and  other  intangible 
assets  that  are  considered  when  appraising  the  business,  especially  for  purchase.”  
- 19 -

Goodwill, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019).  As this Court has explained,

“[g]oodwill”  in  the  context  of  business  valuation  has  been defined  as  “a 
reasonable  expectation  of  [a  business’]  continued  profitable  operation.”  
See T.H. Eng'g & Mfg., Inc. v. Mussard, No. E2001-02406-COA-R3-CV, 
2002  WL  1034029,  at  *2  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  May  23,  2002).    As  this  Court 
recognized with regard to valuation of goodwill:

Many factors are involved; the name of the firm, its reputation 
for doing business, the location, the number and character of 
its  customers,  the  former  success  of  the  business,  and  many 
other elements which would be advantageous in the operation 
of the business.

Id.

Fuller v. Fuller,  No.  E2016-00243-COA-R3-CV,  2016  WL  7403791,  at  *5  (Tenn.  Ct. 
App. Dec. 21, 2016).  

In the context of a divorce, our courts have noted a “fine line” between “the personal 
goodwill of a practitioner and the business goodwill of a practitioner’s business.”  Hartline
v. Hartline,  No.  E2012-02593-COA-R3-CV,  2014  WL  103801,  at  *13  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
Jan.  13,  2014) (emphasis  added).    Although  we  have  “recognized  the  existence  of 
‘enterprise’  or  ‘business’  goodwill  as  a  distinct  concept  from  professional  or  personal 
goodwill,  this  Court  has  been  reluctant  to  allow  enterprise  goodwill  to  be  divided  as  a 
marital  asset  upon  divorce  when  the  business  involved  is  a  sole  proprietorship [of  a 
spouse].”  Lunn v. Lunn, No. E2014-00865-COA-R3-CV, 2015 WL 4187344, at *6 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. June 29, 2015) (internal citations omitted).  However, this Court has determined 
that  a  distinction  may  be  considered  between  a  spouse’s  personal  goodwill  in  the 
community and the goodwill of his or her professional business “where the practitioner has 
one  or  more  partners  or  pre-established  contracts  that  could  be  assumed  by  another 
practitioner.”  Hartline, 2014 WL 103801, at *13 (citing York v. York, No. 01-A-01-9104-
CV-00131, 1992 WL 181710 at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 31, 1992)).  The reasoning behind 
this  consideration  being  that  professional  practices  with  multiple  partners  or  pre-
established  contracts  “do  not  depend  solely  on  the  professional  reputation  of”  the 
practitioner, i.e., the divorcing spouse.  York, 1992 WL 181710 at *3; see also Fuller, 2016 
WL 7403791, at *5-6 (holding that where a source of a spouse’s income “could be sold or 
assigned  pursuant  to  a  recognized  method  of  valuation,”  such  income  was  separate  and 
distinct from personal goodwill and divisible as a marital asset on divorce).  Importantly, 
in such cases, the spouse had an ownership interest in the business where the valuation of 
the business’s goodwill was in question.  

- 20 -

By  Wife’s  own  allegations  in  the  proposed  second  amended  complaint,  Husband 
was not the owner of W&A, Inc.  Rather, Wife alleged in paragraph 8 that “[a]t the time of 
the  Focus  Transaction,  the  stock  was  nominally  owned  one hundred  percent  (100%) 
between the Waddell Trust and the DSW Trust.”  Although Wife failed to specifically state 
to which “stock” she was referring, in paragraph 26 she alleged that “the DSW Trust and 
the  Waddell  Trust  continue  to  own  one  hundred  percent  (100%)  of  the  Waddell  & 
Associates, Inc. (now referred to as AMWJR, Inc.) stock.”  Thus, according to the proposed 
second amended complaint, at no time did Husband have an ownership interest in W&A, 
Inc. such that the enterprise goodwill of the company could be valued as a marital asset in 
the  divorce.    As  to  Wife’s  allegations  that  Focus  purchased  Husband’s  personal  and 
professional  goodwill,  aside  from  her  allegation  that  W&A,  Inc.,  not  Husband, was  the 
seller in the transaction, even if Focus purchased this goodwill directly from Husband, such 
goodwill  is  not  a  marital  asset  subject  to  division  on  divorce.    See  McKee,  2010  WL 
3245246, at *3; Cunningham, 2000 WL 33191364, at *3; Smith, 709 S.W.2d at 592. 

A  close  reading  of Wife’s  proposed  second  amended complaint reveals that 
“Husband’s  book  of  business,  personal,  professional,  and  enterprise  goodwill”  were  the 
only  marital  assets  that  Wife  alleged were placed  into  the  DSW  Trust  #2.    Thus,  as 
discussed  above,  by  Wife’s  own  allegations,  the  DSW  Trust  #2  did  not  contain  marital 
property.    We  note  that  Wife  also  raised  what  appears  to  be  an  alter  ego/fraud  claim 
concerning  Husband’s  control  over  the  DSW  Trust  #2.    Wife  alleged  that  Husband 
removed  himself  as  trustee  of  the  DSW  Trust  (we  presume  Wife  meant  to  allege  that 
Husband  removed  himself  as  trustee  of  the  DSW  Trust  #2),  partially  in  anticipation  of 
divorce, and that his removal  “was to shield the trust’s assets from Wife’s claims to the 
property placed in the Trust.”  Additionally, Wife alleged that Husband removed himself 
as trustee “in an effort to hide [his] dominion and control over the Trusts.”  As discussed, 
supra, Wife’s own allegations show that she had no claim to the property she alleged to be 
in the DSW Trust #2.  Thus, allowing Wife to file the proposed second amended complaint 
and to join the DSW Trust #2 as a party would have been futile because, by Wife’s own 
allegations,  the  trust  did  not  contain  marital  property  subject  to  division  in  the  divorce.  
Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s denial of Wife’s October 30, 2018 motion for leave 
to amend the complaint.

B.  Issues Concerning Injunctions and Wife’s Electronic Devices11

We  now  turn  to  Wife’s  issue  concerning  the  injunctions  against  her  and  the 
confiscation  of  her  electronic  devices  and  email  accounts.    A  review  of  the  relevant
procedural background is helpful here.  As mentioned above, Wife worked as W&A, Inc.’s 
Global Communications Director prior to the divorce.  In that role, Wife was given access 

                                           

11 This section addresses Wife’s ninth issue: “Did the trial court err in ordering the destruction of 
attorney-client materials and files, the destruction of Wife’s email accounts, and in ordering the confiscation 
of Wife’s electronic devices?”

- 21 -

to confidential and proprietary information belonging to, at the time, W&A, Inc.  After the 
Focus Transaction in 2016, this information belonged to W&A, LLC and/or AMWJR, Inc.  
To protect such information from becoming public, on November 14, 2017, shortly after 
Wife  filed  for  divorce,  the  parties  entered  into  a  consent protective  order  and  order 
expanding temporary mutual injunction.  In part, these orders required the parties to allow 
a  third-party  vendor  to  “collect  all  copies  of  electronically  stored  and/or  print  copies  of 
downloads and all computers and removable media . . . ever used by Wife on behalf of any 
business entity in which Defendant now has an interest, or has had an interest in the past, 
as well as access codes, passwords and/or authorization codes.”  W&A, LLC was ordered 
to pay the cost of the third-party vendor’s services.

In January 2019, it became apparent that Wife did not produce all of the documents 
required  under  the  November  14,  2017  order,  and  that  she  still  retained  proprietary 
information belonging to W&A, LLC and/or AMWJR, Inc.  This discovery led to the trial 
court’s entry of four orders in February 2019.  Relevant here, the first of these orders, the 
February 11, 2019 order granting in part and reserving in part Husband’s application for 
injunctive  relief,  required  Wife  to  turn  over  all  documents  within  the  scope  of  the 
November  14,  2017  order  to  Husband’s counsel.    We  note  that,  although  the  order  was 
entered on February 11, 2019, it appears the trial court ruled orally on this issue on February 
4, 2019.  The order also required Wife to turn over her electronic devices, including her 
cell phones, computer, cameras, flash drives, and external hard drives, to her counsel “for 
safekeeping  until  the  [trial  c]ourt  [could]  make  a  determination  on  how  to  best  access 
information off of [Wife’s] devices.”  If Wife had any documents within the scope of the 
November 14, 2017 order stored on a third-party online storage account, she was ordered 
to produce a copy of those documents and then delete them from her online storage account.  

The record shows that Wife turned over her electronic devices to her counsel, but 
shortly  thereafter,  as  discussed  above,  retrieved  them  from  her  counsel’s  office.  
Accordingly, in the February 11, 2019 order of injunction, Wife was ordered to deliver her 
devices to Insight, the third-party vendor hired to inspect them.  This order also required 
Wife to provide  Insight  with  her  “passwords,  credentials  and  access  information  to  all 
online storage and webmail accounts.”  The order provided that “[n]o device  mentioned 
above will be returned to anyone without a [c]ourt [o]rder.”  Also on February 11, 2019, 
the trial court entered an order modifying the February 4, 2019, order granting in part and 
reserving  in  part  Husband’s  application  for  injunctive  relief  wherein  the  trial  court 
restrained  Wife  “from  destroying,  deleting,  erasing,  modifying,  or  otherwise  failing  to 
preserve documents and/or information that come[s] within the scope of the 11/14/2017 
[o]rder that [Wife] may have stored and/or shared with a third[-]party or on a third[-]party 
online file storage account[.]”

By  order  of  February 13,  2019,  the  trial  court  again  ordered  Wife  to  deliver, to 
Insight by 10 a.m. on February 14, 2019, “all documents and devices that Wife provided 
to [her counsel’s] firm on Monday, February 11, 2019 as well as all documents and devices 
- 22 -

that may not have been provided” to her counsel, including her phones, iPad, computer, 
cameras,  flash  drives,  and  external  hard  drives.  Again,  the  trial  court  ordered Wife  to 
provide Insight with the passwords to her email accounts and cloud-based storage accounts.  
Insight was ordered to extract forensic data from all devices from January 1, 2014 until the 
date the order was entered.  Insight was also ordered to make archived copies of Wife’s 
online file storage accounts and email accounts.  Thereafter, Insight was to create an index 
of  the  contents  of  the  information  it  collected  from  Wife’s  devices  and  accounts  and 
provide such index to Wife’s counsel.  Then, Wife’s counsel was to prepare a privilege log 
for all privileged documents and/or communications.  After the privilege log was provided 
to  Husband’s  counsel,  Insight  would  release  the  non-privileged  material  to  Husband’s 
counsel.    The  order  also  provided  that  Insight  would  “remove  all  company  property 
belonging to Waddell & Associates, LLC from Wife’s devices before returning the devices 
to Wife.”  On March 27, 2019, Wife filed a motion to set aside, modify, suspend, and/or 
stay the February 13, 2019 order.

On  May  8,  9,  and  10,  2019,  the  trial  court  held  hearings  on  various  motions, 
including Wife’s motion to set aside the February 13, 2019 order.  During these hearings, 
it became apparent that third-parties to the divorce action may have received proprietary 
documents and information belonging to all of the Entities, not simply W&A, LLC and/or 
AMWJR, Inc.   As a result, the trial court appointed a  Special Master to  “work with the 
individuals identified so far and any other individuals who may have property belonging 
to [the Entities], to retrieve that property, and turn that property over to Insight[.]”  On May 
10, 2019, the trial court heard argument from Wife’s counsel regarding the magnitude of 
the privilege log that Wife’s counsel was required to create under the February 13th order, 
to-wit: “I think they may agree with me that this may be a task that cannot be done in that 
I have to certify things as privileged that I can’t see and they’re in the millions.”  Although 
the  trial  court  denied  the  motion  to  set  aside,  it  took  under  advisement  “the  motion  to 
modify  only  as  it  relate[d]  to  the  feasibility  of  the  privilege  log[.]”    Thereafter,  the  trial 
court  ordered, sua  sponte,  that  the Special  Master  would  work  with  Wife’s  counsel  and 
Insight to “figure out an appropriate resolution” concerning the magnitude of data taken 
from Wife’s devices and the privilege log.  We note that the May 10, 2019 order provided 
that the “Special Master [would] also be charged with ensuring that any property belonging 
to [the Entities] contained on any devices . . . [would be] indexed and then permanently 
deleted.”  The trial court’s order made clear that the only documents Wife could possess 
concerning the Entities were those she obtained through discovery.

Turning to her appellate arguments, Wife begins this section of her brief by arguing 
that “[t]he totality of the [trial c]ourt’s action beginning with the February 11, 2019 Order 
through  the  entry  of  the  Sua  sponte  Order  Compelling  Turnover  of  Company  and  Trust 
Property  and  Appointing  Special  Master  on  May  10,  2019”  was  an  abuse  of  discretion 
which  violated  Wife’s  fundamental  right  to  privacy.”    She  concludes  this  section  of  her 
brief  by  arguing  that  “[t]he  actions  of  the  trial  court  constitute  an  abuse  of  discretion 
resulting in a violation of Wife’s fundamental rights and are not supported by any evidence 
- 23 -

that Wife ever violated any of the orders entered on November 14, 2017 and all such orders 
should be vacated.”  Although it is unclear from her briefing, we deduce that Wife asks 
this Court to vacate the following orders: (1) February 11, 2019 order granting in part and 
reserving in part Husband’s application for injunctive relief; (2) February 11, 2019 order 
of injunction; (3) February 11, 2019 order modifying the February 4, 2019, order granting 
in part and reserving in part Husband’s application for injunctive relief; (4) February 13, 
2019 order on the preservation and retrieval of information from Wife’s electronic devices 
and online storage accounts and webmail accounts; and (5) May 10, 2019 sua sponte order 
compelling turnover of company and trust property and appointing a Special Master.

Wife fails to develop any substantive argument as to why this Court should vacate 
the foregoing orders.    Tennessee  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  27(a)(7)(A)  requires  an 
appellant’s brief to contain an argument setting forth “the contentions of the appellant with 
respect  to  the  issues  presented,  and  the  reasons  therefor,  including  the  reasons  why  the 
contentions  require  appellate  relief,  with  citations  to  the  authorities and  appropriate 
references  to  the  record  (which  may  be  quoted  verbatim)  relied  on.”    Tenn.  R.  App.  P. 
27(a)(7)(A) (emphasis added).  This portion of Wife’s brief reads mostly as a procedural 
history of the orders, discussed supra, with Wife alleging some “facts” but failing to cite 
to  the  record.    Although  Wife  makes  sweeping  statements  that  the  trial  court  abused  its 
discretion and invaded her privacy, she fails to develop this argument.  Indeed, in the three 
pages of this portion of her appellate brief, Wife cites to only one legal authority, West v.
Media General Convergence, Inc.,  53  S.W.3d  640,  643  (Tenn.  2001),  a  Tennessee 
Supreme Court case concerning Tennessee’s recognition of the tort of false light invasion 
of privacy.  Wife cites to West twice in support of her arguments that “Tennessee Courts 
have recognized the right to privacy as ‘the right to be let alone; the right of a person to be 
free  from  unwarranted  publicity,’”  and  that  “[t]he  trial  court’s  orders  resulted  in  an 
‘intrusion [that] has gone beyond the limits of decency. . . .”  This is the extent of Wife’s 
“argument.”  

“This  [C]ourt  has  repeatedly  held  that  a  party’s  failure  to  cite  authority  for  its 
arguments  or  to  argue  the  issues  in  the  body of  its  brief  constitute  a  waiver  on  appeal.”  
Forbess  v.  Forbess,  370  S.W.3d  347,  355  (Tenn.  Ct. App.  2011) (citing  Newcomb  v. 
Kohler Co., 222 S.W.3d 368, 401 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006) (failure “to cite to any authority 
or to construct an argument regarding [a] position on appeal” constitutes a waiver of the 
issue); Bean v. Bean, 40 S.W.3d 52, 55-56 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000) (“Courts have routinely 
held  that  the  failure  to  make  appropriate  references  to  the  record  and  to  cite  relevant 
authority  in  the  argument  section  of  the  brief as  required  by  Rule  27(a)(7)  constitutes  a 
waiver  of  the  issue.”));  see  also Tellico  Village  Property  Owners  Ass’n,  Inc.  v.  Health 
Solutions, LLC, No. E2012-00101-COA-R3-CV, 2013 WL 362815, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
Jan. 30, 2013).  Indeed, “[i]t is not the role of the courts, trial or appellate, to research or 
construct a litigant’s case or arguments for him or her, and where a party fails to develop 
an argument in support of his or her contention or merely constructs a skeletal argument, 
the issue is waived.”  Sneed v. Bd. of Prof’l Responsibility of Sup. Ct., 301 S.W.3d 603, 
- 24 -

615 (Tenn. 2010).

Although Wife asks us to  vacate  “all such orders,” this Court notes that  vacating 
these orders would not provide Wife any relief in view of the fact that Insight completed 
its review of the data found on Wife’s devices more than three years ago.  However, based 
on the following section of Wife’s brief, we deduce that Wife may be seeking the return of 
her property, but she does not explicitly ask for such remedy from this Court, to-wit:

To this day Wife is without her phones, laptops, ipads, email accounts, and 
icloud accounts as the Special Master is holding all such items pending the 
outcome of this appeal.  If this Court does not vacate the trial court’s orders 
pertaining  to  these  devices,  email  accounts,  and  electronic  storage 
accounts[,] all such material and accounts will be destroyed.  The actions of 
the  trial  court  constitute  an  abuse  of  discretion  resulting  in  a  violation  of 
Wife’s fundamental rights and are not supported by any evidence that Wife 
ever violated any of the orders entered on November 14, 2017 and all such 
orders should be vacated.

On this Court’s review, it does not appear that any of the orders Wife cited in this portion 
of her brief called for the destruction of her devices or accounts, and Wife does not cite to 
the record to support her argument that “all such material and accounts will be destroyed.”  
Given Wife’s waiver of this issue, we decline to vacate any of the trial court’s February 
2019 orders.

C.  Pre-Trial Procedural Issues12

Wife  raises  two  pre-trial  procedural issues  for  our  review–whether  the  trial  court 
erred when it: (1) denied her second motion for continuance; and (2) excluded certain of 
her fact and expert witnesses from testifying at trial.  We review a trial court’s ruling on a 
motion for continuance under an abuse of discretion standard.  See Sliger v. Sliger, 181 
S.W.3d 684, 687 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).  We review pre-trial discovery issues such as the 
trial court’s ruling concerning Wife’s fact and expert witnesses under the same standard.  
See Riley v. Whybrew, 185 S.W.3d 393, 399 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).  As discussed, above, 
“[a] trial court abuses its discretion only when it ‘applie[s] an incorrect legal standard, or 
reache[s]  a  decision  which  is  against  logic  or  reasoning  that  cause[s]  an  injustice  to  the 
party complaining.’”  Eldridge v. Eldridge, 42 S.W.3d 82, 85 (Tenn. 2001) (quoting State 
v.  Shirley,  6  S.W.3d  243,  247  (Tenn.  1999)  (brackets  in  original).    Under  the  abuse  of 
discretion standard, a trial court’s ruling “will be upheld so long as reasonable minds can 
disagree as to propriety of the decision made.  Id. (quoting State v. Scott, 33 S.W.3d 746, 
752 (Tenn. 2000)); see also State v. Gilliland, 22 S.W.3d 266, 270 (Tenn. 2000).  

                                           

12 Section (C)(1)-(2) addresses Wife’s third issue: “Did the trial court err in denying Wife’s Motion 

for Continuance and in excluding Wife’s fact and expert witnesses?”

- 25 -

1.  Denial of Second Motion for Continuance

“Decisions  regarding  continuances  are  fact-specific,”  and  “motions  for  a 
continuance  should  be  viewed  in  the  context  of  all  the  circumstances  existing  when  the 
motion [was] filed.”  Nagarajan v. Terry, 151 S.W.3d 166, 172 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003).  In 
determining  whether  to  grant  a  continuance,  courts  consider:  (1)  the  length  of  time  the 
proceeding has been pending; (2) the reason for the continuance; (3) the diligence of the 
party  seeking  the  continuance;  (4)  and  the  prejudice  to  the  requesting  party  if  the 
continuance is not granted.  Id.  “In order to prove that a requested continuance is justified, 
the party requesting the continuance ‘must supply some ‘strong excuse’ for postponing the 
trial date.’”  Tidwell v. Burkes, No. M2015-01270-COA-R3-CV, 2016 WL 3771553, at *5 
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  July  8,  2016) (quoting  Howell v. Ryerkerk, 372  S.W.3d  576,  580-81 
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2012)  (quoting Barber & McMurray, Inc. v. Top-Flite Dev. Corp.
Inc., 720 S.W.2d 469, 471 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1986))).  

The crux of Wife’s second motion for continuance was that the first year-and-a-half
of the case was spent litigating whether the Entities should be included as parties in the 
divorce.  For this reason, Wife argued that she had not had time to prepare for trial and that 
a continuance was warranted because discovery was outstanding, witness and exhibit lists 
had yet to be disclosed, depositions had not been scheduled or completed, and a temporary 
support  hearing  had  not  yet  concluded.    Wife  further  argued  that  a  continuance  was 
appropriate because: (1) her counsel was relatively new to the case and required time to 
review all of the pleadings in the matter; (2) her counsel had been engaged in complying 
with the trial court’s February 2019 orders, discussed supra, and were unable to prepare 
for trial; (3) Wife had spent substantial time and resources defending against Husband’s 
petitions  for  contempt;  and  (4)  Wife  was  without  the  financial  resources  to  adequately 
prepare for trial.

Turning to the record, when Wife filed the second motion for continuance on May 
3, 2019, the case had been pending for almost two years.  The record shows that the case 
originally was set for trial on December 10, 2018.  On October 18, 2018, the trial court 
entered  a  consent  order  that,  inter  alia,  continued  the  trial  until  February  11,  2019.   On 
December 6, 2018, Wife filed a motion to revise consent scheduling order and to continue 
trial date.  In this first motion for continuance, Wife made many of the same arguments she 
made in the motion now on review, i.e., that discovery was outstanding and that she lacked 
the financial ability to prosecute the divorce.  On December 13, 2018, by agreement of the 
parties, the trial court continued the February 11, 2019 trial date until May 29, 2019.

As discussed above, on January 24, 2019, Wife produced 2,400 files of documents 
to  Husband’s  counsel.    This  production  was  the  catalyst  for  the  contempt  proceedings 
against  Wife and  led  to  the  confiscation  of  her devices,  discussed  at  length,  supra.    By 
order of January 29, 2019, the DSW Trust #2, the remaining entity, was dismissed from 
- 26 -

the case.  On February 4, 2019, the trial court orally ordered Wife to deliver her computer, 
iPhone, and three flash drives to her previous counsel’s office, which she did.  On Friday, 
February 8, 2019, the trial court heard Wife’s motion for leave to amend the complaint,
wherein she sought to add the DSW Trust #2 back as a party to the divorce.  That same 
day, unbeknownst to her previous counsel, Wife retrieved the devices from her counsel’s 
office.   On  Monday,  February  11,  2019,  Wife’s  previous  counsel announced  to  the  trial 
court that she was withdrawing due to Wife’s actions.  Although Wife’s new counsel did 
not  file  a  notice  of  appearance  until  March  12,  2019,  the  record  shows  that  she  was 
representing  Wife  around  February  11,  2019.    Thereafter,  the  parties  simultaneously 
litigated the injunctions and contempt proceedings against Wife while also moving forward 
in preparation for trial.  As mentioned above, Wife filed the second motion for continuance 
on May 3, 2019, which motion the trial court denied by order entered May 22, 2019.

Although the parties spent considerable time litigating whether the Entities should 
be joined in the divorce, Wife had several months after the majority of this litigation ended 
to prepare for trial.  In the months leading up to trial, the parties were not only preparing 
for  trial  but  also  were  litigating  the  injunctions  and  contempt  proceedings  against  Wife.  
While such litigation was certainly costly and time consuming, we note, as the trial court 
did in its order denying Wife’s motion for continuance, that the foregoing litigation was 
the  result  of  Wife’s  actions.    Likewise,  and  as  discussed  further,  infra, Wife’s  actions 
prevented  the  temporary  support  hearing, scheduled  for  February  13,  2019, from 
proceeding as  her  previous  counsel withdrew two  days  prior to  the  scheduled  hearing.  
Nevertheless, we also  note,  as  will  be  discussed  further,  infra,  that  Wife  had  received 
approximately $315,000 in distributions from the marital estate to use towards attorney’s 
fees and expenses, and she was awarded an additional $64,000 from the marital estate via 
the trial court’s May 22, 2019 order on Wife’s motion to compel and/or for attorney’s fees 
and temporary support.  In view of the foregoing, we conclude that Wife’s reasons for a 
second  continuance did  not  constitute  a  “strong  excuse”;  as  such, the  trial  court  did  not 
abuse its discretion in denying her request.

2.  Exclusion of Wife’s Expert and Fact Witnesses

Wife  appeals  the  trial  court’s  exclusion  of  her  expert  and  fact  witnesses.  
Specifically, Wife argues that “the [t]rial [c]ourt failed to articulate any appropriate basis 
for its exclusion of Wife’s expert testimony or for its exclusion of Wife’s fact witnesses 
within its orders.”  (Emphasis in original).13  We disagree.  We first review the exclusion 
of Wife’s expert witnesses.  This issue is predicated on two scheduling orders, under which
the parties operated during the litigation.  Turning to the record, on October 18, 2018, the 
parties entered into a consent order setting deadlines and trial date.  In pertinent part, this 
order  provided  an  October  31,  2018  deadline for  Wife  to  submit  her  expert  disclosures.  

                                           

13 In this portion of her briefing, Wife fails to cite to the trial court’s amended order concerning the 

exclusion of her expert witnesses wherein the trial court stated its bases for such exclusion.

- 27 -

The order  also  provided  for  a  December  14,  2018 deadline  for  the  parties  to  exchange 
expert reports.  The record shows that Wife provided her expert disclosures to Husband on 
October  30,  2018.    Relevant  here,  Wife  disclosed  both  Mr.  Mike  Yopp  and  Ms.  Cindy 
MacAulay  as  experts.    In  the  disclosure,  Wife  provided  that  Mr.  Yopp  was  expected  to 
testify

regarding specific actions taken by David Sewall Waddell and others which 
will  allow  for  the  Court  to  conclude  (i)  that David  Sewall  Waddell  placed 
marital assets into the Waddell Trust, the DSW Trust and/or the DSW Trust 
#2 and (ii) that David Sewall Waddell exercised dominion and control over 
the  Waddell  Trust,  the  DSW  Trust  and/or  the  DSW  Trust  #2  such  a[s] to 
render  David  Sewall  Waddell  the  true  owner of  the  trust  assets,  which  are 
marital assets. Pursuant to Court order, Mr. Yopp will render a report in this 
case  by  December  14,  2018,  which  will  more  specifically  set  forth  precise 
subject matter of his expected testimony in this matter.

(Emphasis added).  Concerning Ms. MacAulay’s testimony, Wife provided that she was 
expected to testify

regarding the structure and the terms of the Focus Transaction as described 
in  the  Contribution  Purchase  Agreement  and  the  documents  produced  in 
Discovery. Ms. MacAulay will describe and distinguish the assets within the 
transaction, identifying property which was sold by Waddell & Associates, 
Inc, and property which was sold by Husband. Pursuant to Court order, Ms. 
MacAulay will render a report in this case by December 14, 2018.

(Emphasis added).

On  December  13,  2018,  the  day  before  the  deadline  for  the  parties  to  exchange 
expert  reports,  the  trial  court  entered  a  second  order  modifying  the  previous  scheduling 
order.  As discussed, supra, in this order, the trial court set February 13, 2019 as Wife’s 
deadline to produce her expert reports.  Husband was ordered to provide his expert reports 
by March 1, 2019.  The order also provided that expert witness depositions would conclude 
by  April  5,  2019.   On  January  23,  2019,  Wife  filed  a  motion  to  extend  the  deadline  for 
expert reports, but this motion was never heard.  It is undisputed that Wife never produced
expert reports from Mr. Yopp or Ms. MacAulay.

On May 22, 2019, Husband filed the first motion in limine to exclude the testimony 
of Mr. Yopp and Ms. MacAulay.  In this  motion, Husband argued, inter alia, that Wife 
failed to produce her expert reports by the February 13, 2019 deadline, that she could not 
show good cause for such failure, and that allowing Wife’s experts to testify would deny 
Husband a fair rebuttal.  From the record, it does not appear that Wife filed a response to 
this  motion.    On  May  28,  2019,  the  trial  court  heard  the  first  motion  in  limine.    At  the 
- 28 -

hearing, Wife’s counsel argued that Husband was “properly on notice” of Wife’s experts.  
By order of May 29, 2019, the trial court granted the first motion in limine.  On May 31, 
2019, the trial court entered an amended order on the motion, wherein it made, inter alia, 
the following findings of fact: (1) Wife timely disclosed her expert witnesses, and in the 
disclosure, Wife represented that she would produce the expert reports by December 14, 
2018, as ordered in the first scheduling order; (2) a second scheduling order extended the 
deadline for Wife to produce her expert reports until February 13, 2019; (3) on January 23, 
2019,  Wife  filed  a  motion  to  extend  the  deadline  for  expert  reports, but  the  motion  was 
never heard, and no extension was granted; (4) Wife failed to follow the scheduling order 
because  she  did  not  produce  the  expert  reports;  (5)  it  would  be  unfairly  prejudicial  to 
Husband  to  allow  Mr.  Yopp  and  Ms.  MacAulay  to  testify  because,  under  the  second 
scheduling order, Husband was to have two weeks after Wife produced her expert reports 
to produce his expert reports, and the parties would then have the opportunity to depose 
the experts; (6) as a result of Wife’s failure to follow the scheduling order and to produce 
expert reports, Husband was denied a fair opportunity for rebuttal; and (7) Wife could not 
show good cause for failing to produce such reports.

A trial court is given discretion to enter a scheduling order that provides time limits
for the parties to complete discovery.  Tenn. R. Civ. P. 16.01(1)(C).  “If a party or party’s 
attorney fails to obey a scheduling or pretrial order . . . the judge, upon motion or the judge’s 
own initiative, may make such orders with regard thereto as are just[.]”  Tenn. R. Civ. P. 
16.06; see also Waters v. Coker, No. M2007-01867-COA-RM-CV, 2008 WL 4072104, at 
*7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 28, 2008) (“It is within the trial judge’s discretion to decide what 
orders, if any, to issue as a consequence of a party’s failure to obey a scheduling order.”).  
We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it excluded Mr. Yopp and Ms.
MacAulay  from  testifying  as  experts.    In  her  October  30,  2018  expert  disclosure,  Wife 
acknowledged that she was under a court order to produce expert reports by a date certain, 
and she also represented that she would comply with this order.  Although Wife’s counsel
argued  at  the  hearing  that  Husband  was  “properly  on  notice”  of  Wife’s  experts,  Wife’s 
October 30, 2018 disclosure provided  very  general information concerning the expected 
testimony.  For example, in the disclosure concerning Mr. Yopp, Wife noted that Mr. Yopp 
would render a report “which [would] more specifically set forth precise subject matter of 
his  expected  testimony  in  this  matter.”    As  the  trial  court  found  in  its  order,  Wife  was 
unable  to  show  good  cause  for  failing  to  produce  the  expert  reports.    While  it  does  not 
appear that Wife filed a response to the first motion in limine, at the hearing on the motion, 
Wife’s counsel explained that Wife did not file the expert reports because her experts “have 
not  felt  comfortable  releasing  anything  in  writing”  until  they  reviewed  all  discovery 
documents for fear of violating the trial court’s injunctions, discussed at length, supra.  As 
previously discussed, the trial court entered the orders of injunction due to Wife’s actions.  
Accordingly,  we  agree  with  the  trial  court  that  Wife’s  explanation  does  not  show  good 
cause  as  to  why  the  reports  were  never  produced.    Furthermore,  the  record  shows  that 
Husband  relied  on  Wife’s  representations  that  she  would  provide  expert  reports,  and he 
anticipated taking Wife’s experts’ depositions after receiving their reports, as contemplated 
- 29 -

in the December 13, 2018 scheduling order.  It is undisputed that expert depositions were 
never  taken.    Although a trial  court  may  continue  a  final  trial date to  allow  for  expert 
depositions,  for  the  reasons  discussed  at  length,  supra,  the  trial  court  did  not  abuse  its 
discretion  when  it  denied  Wife’s  motion  for  continuance.    Under these circumstances, 
allowing Wife’s expert witnesses to testify would have prejudiced Husband as he would 
have been unable to prepare adequate rebuttals to the experts’ testimony.  Accordingly, we 
conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Mr. Yopp’s and Ms. 
MacAulay’s testimony. 

Wife  also  argues  that  the  trial  court  “arbitrarily  excluded”  nine  of  Wife’s  other 
witnesses  from  testifying.    Turning  to  the  record,  on  May  28,  2019,  Husband  filed  his 
second motion in limine to exclude testimony of witnesses Wife revealed four days before 
trial.  Therein, Husband sought to exclude eight fact witnesses and presumably one expert 
witness, Wife’s  treating  physician,14 on  the  basis  that  Wife  failed  to  disclose  them  as 
witnesses in discovery, a fact that appears to be undisputed.  Indeed, the record shows that 
Wife’s counsel sent emails listing witnesses to Husband’s counsel on May 25 and May 27, 
2019,  when  the  case  was  set  for  trial  to  begin  on  May  29,  2019.   At  the  hearing  on  the 
second motion in limine, Wife failed to provide good cause for her delay in disclosing the 
lay  witnesses  and  made no  argument  regarding  the  same.    Concerning  Wife’s  treating 
physician,  her counsel argued that,  because  Wife  discussed  her  diagnosis  and  treatment
from  said  physician  during  her  deposition,  the  physician  should  be  allowed  to  testify 
concerning the same.  However, Wife’s counsel also admitted that, in her 2017 response to 
Husband’s interrogatories, Wife represented that she did not and has never had a medical 
or psychological condition.  Despite making the foregoing representations, and despite not 
designating  her  treating  physician as  an  expert  (or  fact)  witness,  at  trial,  Wife  sought  to 
admit medical records at trial (which her counsel produced to Husband’s counsel on May 
27,  2019) and  further  sought  to  have  her  treating  physician  testify  about  these  records.  
During  the  hearing on  the  second  motion  in  limine,  the  trial  court  stated  that  it  was  not 
going to allow a trial by “ambush,” and Husband was entitled, as all parties are, to rely on 
Wife’s discovery responses.  Accordingly, by order of June 4, 2019, the trial court granted 
the second motion in limine.  

We  conclude that the  trial  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  by  excluding  Wife’s 
nine witnesses, which she disclosed mere days before the final trial.  Under Tennessee Rule 
of  Civil  Procedure  26.05(1),  Wife  had a  duty  to  seasonably  supplement  her  discovery 
responses “with respect to any question directly addressed to (A) the identity and location 
of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (B) the identity of each person 
expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which the person 
is expected to testify, and the substance of that testimony.”  Tenn. R. Civ. P. 26.05(1).  “A 

                                           

14 It is unclear if Wife sought to introduce her treating physician as an expert or fact witness.  In the 
email  to  Husband’s  attorney,  Wife’s  attorney  indicated  that  Wife’s  treating  physician  would  testify  to 
“[W]ife’s health conditions, presentation, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment plan, [and] prognosis.”

party who[,] without substantial justification[,] fails to supplement or amend responses to 
discovery  requests  as  required  by  Rule  26.05  is  not  permitted,  unless  such  failure  is 
harmless, to use as evidence at trial . . . any witness or information not so disclosed.”  Tenn. 
R. Civ. P. 37.03(1).  As the trial court correctly noted, “[t]he rules concerning discovery 
were promulgated to allow the parties to ascertain relevant facts pertaining to their case, 
thus  narrowing  the  issues  in  order  to  reach  a  decision  on  the  merits  without  ‘trial  by 
ambush.’”  Austin v. City of Memphis, 684 S.W.2d 624, 632 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).  Wife 
had  ample  opportunity  to  supplement  her  discovery  responses to  include  the  nine 
individuals as potential witnesses.  Allowing testimony from undisclosed witnesses, when 
Husband was without the opportunity to interview or depose them, would certainly have 
been  prejudicial  to  him.    Accordingly,  we  cannot  conclude  the  trial  court  erred  when  it 
granted the second motion in limine.

D.  Evidence Related to Assets in Trust15

Wife’s  next  stated  issue  is:  “Did  the  trial  court  err  in  refusing  to  consider  all
evidence related to the assets, including the assets placed in trust, and made an equitable 
division an impossibility?”  As to this issue, Wife’s argument appears to be that the trial 
court erred in its equitable division of the marital estate because it “refused to consider the 
assets placed in trust by Husband during the marriage[.]” Although it is not clear to which 
“trust” Wife refers, for reasons discussed, infra, such distinction is immaterial for purposes 
of our analysis. We note that Wife does not dispute the trial court’s division of assets that 
it found to be marital property.

In her appellate brief, Wife argues that despite her requests, the trial court “refused 
to  consider  the  assets  placed  in  trust  by  Husband  during  the  marriage  and  Husband’s 
interests in his various businesses which Wife consistently alleged were marital in nature.”  
As support for this argument, Wife cites pre-trial hearings and part of her opening statement
at  trial wherein  Wife’s  counsel  engaged  in  a  lengthy  discussion  with the  trial  court 
concerning whether the trial court would hear proof on whether a trust held marital assets.  
At the pre-trial hearing and during Wife’s opening statement, the trial court repeated that 
it would not hear such evidence because: (1) it had dismissed all of the Entities; and (2) 
Wife’s amended complaint failed to allege a claim that a trust held marital assets.16  Despite 
this pronouncement, the trial court also stated: “I’m just going to hear the case.  I’m going 
to hear the witnesses.  I will take objections.”  On May 29, 2019, during Wife’s opening 
statement, the trial court invited Wife’s counsel to make an offer of proof at the end of trial 
to preserve the issue for appeal, to-wit:

Well, we’ll just have to see as we go because I can’t forecast the entire case.  
I’m just trying to narrow the issue because it sounds like you want to put on 

                                           

15 This section addresses Wife’s fourth issue.
16 As discussed, supra, we affirm the trial court’s orders on both of these issues.

- 31 -

a lot of proof to present this case, and I’m not going to let you do it in the 
case in chief.  Now if you want to take it up as an offer of proof at the end, 
I’ll be glad to let you have at it.  But I’m not going to draw this case out on 
this type of evidence.

So please try to—try to focus on what the parties’ income is, the custody of 
the children, alimony, attorney fees, the division of the assets.  To the extent 
you’re contending that there were assets related to the . . . Focus transaction, 
if those assets are part of the trust, then hold that and make that offer at the 
end of the case.

(Emphases added).

The  Tennessee  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  require  the  appellant  to  prepare  the 
record on appeal so that it conveys a fair, accurate, and complete account of what transpired 
with  respect  to  those  issues  that  are  the  bases  of  appeal.  Tenn.  R. App.  P.  24(b).    This 
burden  begins  when  the  parties  are  before  the  trial  court.    If  a  party  attempts  to  admit 
evidence  that  the  party  argues  is  relevant  to  the  case, but  the  trial  court  excludes  such 
evidence, the party must then make an offer of proof to preserve the issue of the evidence 
exclusion for appeal.  “‘[I]t is essential that a proper offer of proof be made in order that 
the appellate court can determine whether or not [inclusion or exclusion of evidence] was 
reversible.’”    Harwell v. Walton, 820  S.W.2d  116,  118  (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991) 
(quoting State v. Goad, 707 S.W.2d 846, 853 (Tenn. 1986)). We will not reverse a trial 
court’s  evidentiary  ruling  if  the  appellant  fails  to  make  an  offer  of  proof  regarding  the 
substance of the evidence. Dickey v. McCord, 63 S.W.3d 714, 723 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001)
(citing  Shepherd  v.  Perkins  Builders,  968  S.W.2d  832,  834  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1997)); 
Anderson v. Am. Limestone Co., 168 S.W.3d 757, 762 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004).

From Wife’s brief, we cannot ascertain whether she attempted to make an offer of 
proof concerning whether any of the trusts held marital assets.  Indeed, Wife fails to cite to 
any  portion  of  the  trial  transcript  to  show  that: (1)  she  attempted  to  admit  evidence 
concerning trust assets; or (2) made an offer of proof when such evidence was excluded.  
Our  appellate  rules  require  an  appellant  to  set  forth  an  argument  as  to  each  issue  with 
appropriate  references  to  the  record.    Tenn. R.  App.  P.  27(a)(7)(A);  Tenn.  R.  Ct.  App.
6(a).  “No complaint of . . . action by the trial court will be considered on appeal unless the 
argument contains a specific reference to the page or pages of the record where such action 
is recorded.  No assertion of fact will be considered on appeal unless the argument contains 
a reference to the page or pages of the record where evidence of such fact is recorded.”  
Tenn. R. Ct. App. 6(a).  In order to preserve the record so as to allow this Court to review 
a specific action of the trial court, it was Wife’s burden to cite to the portion of the record 
where such alleged error occurred.  “[T]his Court is not charged with the responsibility of 
scouring the appellate record for any reversible error the trial court may have committed.”  
Owen, 2011 WL 6777014, at *4.

- 32 -

Nevertheless, on this Court’s extensive review of the almost 3,000 pages of the trial 
transcript, we conclude that Wife never made an offer of proof during trial, although she 
was given the opportunity to do so.  On the third day of trial, Wife’s counsel asked the trial 
court, “And Your Honor will allow me to do a proffer at the conclusion of the trial[,]” to 
which the trial court responded, “Yes.”  Also, in the middle of Husband’s closing argument, 
the following exchange occurred:

Trial Court: . . .  And what is very interesting is the fact—and I think I recall 
saying that they could make an offer of proof, that we wouldn’t take them up 
during the trial, but that they could make an offer of proof.  They have not
made an offer of proof in this case. 

Wife’s Counsel:  Your Honor, I thought that would be done at the end, after 
all of these proceedings were concluded because that would be on the record 
outside of Your Honor’s presence. 

Husband’s Counsel:  Got to let us know. 

Wife’s Counsel: That was my—I did let that was my understanding of what 
the [c]ourt—Your Honor’s instructions were. 

Trial Court: I thought we were going to make it at the end of this case, after 
the  witnesses  all  testified,  then  we  would.   But  I’m  ready  to  conclude  this 
case now. 

Wife’s Counsel:  Well, Your Honor, my understanding was that you would 
not—you wouldn’t be hearing the offer of proof because it would be done 
outside  the  presence  of  the  jury  or  a  jury  trial  or  outside  of  Your  Honor’s 
presence.    I  didn’t  want  to  waste  the  [c]ourt’s  time  or  opposing  counsel’s 
time  doing  an  offer  of  proof  on  the  record  when  it  wasn’t  going  to  be 
considered by—obviously an offer of proof, not to be considered by you.  So 
if I misunderstood Your Honor’s instructions on that, I apologize.  But it is 
still my intention—

Trial Court: Well, in a bench trial, I mean, the [c]ourt doesn’t consider it. The 
system understands that when a judge hears a case in a bench trial that the 
judge  is  presumed  to  be  able to  sort  through  and  not,  you  know,  consider 
evidence that's properly before it and evidence that's not, but I’m not inclined 
to try this case again for offers of proof at this point.

Wife’s Counsel: Well, maybe that’s where I’m confused, Your Honor.  When 
I’ve done them before, it’s been me and the court reporter in the courtroom 
- 33 -

after the proceedings concluded.  It’s part of the record, but it’s nothing that 
opposing counsel has to be a part of or that Your Honor—

Trial Court:  Who will have a chance to cross-examine if they decide to on 
an offer of proof?  But we will take that up at the appropriate time.  Have you 
notified counsel that you plan to make an offer of proof? 

Wife’s Counsel: Yes, Your Honor. It was discussed at the beginning of the 
proceedings. It was actually discussed in the motion in limine hearings when 
Your Honor—

Trial Court: What I recall is that I said if any of these witnesses needed to 
testify that they would have to testify at the end of the trial, not after the trial, 
but at the end of the trial.  So again, have y’all been on notice that.

Husband’s  Counsel:  We  haven’t  received  a  notice  that  any  of  [Wife’s]
experts will be testifying. 

Trial Court: It is not scheduled.  I mean, when do you think you’re going to 
do this?  In August or September or October some time? 

Wife’s Counsel: And maybe it’s the mode of the offer of proof that you’re 
thinking versus what I’m thinking, Your Honor. 

Trial Court: Well, they would have to be present for an offer of proof[.]  So, 
you know, I mean, I’m raising this issue and all the sudden you stand up and 
say, well, you know, I was going to make it, but they’re saying they haven’t 
been  put  on  notice  of  that.    And  I  was  waiting  for  the  motion  to  be—you 
know, the request to be made to make the offer.  But we’ll take that up.  But 
again, I don’t want to get off track here.

On this Court’s review of the record, this was the last discussion concerning an offer of 
proof, and Wife never made such an offer.  Because Wife never made an offer of proof, 
this Court is unable to determine whether the trial court’s exclusion of evidence concerning 
marital  assets allegedly placed  in  trust(s)  was  reversible.    Harwell, 820  S.W.2d  at  118
(quoting Goad, 707  S.W.2d  at 853).    Accordingly,  we affirm the  trial  court’s  ruling 
excluding such evidence.  Dickey, 63 S.W.3d at 723 (citing Shepherd, 968 S.W.2d at 834); 
Anderson, 168 S.W.3d at 762 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004).

E.  Issues Concerning the Children

We now turn to the issues concerning the Children.  We note that Easton reached 
majority while this appeal was pending.  Accordingly, our analysis will focus on Saylor 
- 34 -

concerning the designation of the primary residential parent and the parent with decision-
making authority.  Although we focus on Saylor, because the parties presented evidence
and the trial court made findings concerning both Children, some facts concerning Easton 
are included in our discussion as necessary.  Wife’s issues concerning child support pertain 
to both Children, for reasons discussed below.  On appeal, Wife alleges that the trial court 
erred when it designated Husband as Saylor’s primary residential parent with sole decision-
making authority.  Wife also appeals the trial court’s child support award and its denial of 
her request for retroactive child support.  We turn to these issues.

1.  Permanent Parenting Plan Issues17

Under  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  36-6-404(a),  any  final  decree  for  a 
divorce  involving  a  minor  child  shall  incorporate  a  permanent  parenting  plan  into  the 
decree.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-404(a).  A permanent parenting plan is “a written plan for 
the  parenting  and  best  interests  of  the  child,  including  the  allocation  of  parenting 
responsibilities and the establishment of a residential schedule . . . .”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 
36-6-402(3).  A permanent parenting plan shall, inter alia, “[e]stablish the authority and 
responsibilities  of  each  parent  with  respect  to  the  child,”  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-6-
404(a)(2), and “[a]llocate decision-making authority to one (1) or both parties regarding 
the  child’s  education,  health  care,  extracurricular  activities,  and  religious  upbringing.”  
Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-404(a)(5).  As mentioned, supra, every permanent parenting plan 
shall also include a residential schedule, “which designates the primary residential parent 
and designates in which parent’s home the child will reside on given days during the year.”
Cummings v. Cummings,  No.  M2003-00086-COA-R3-CV,  2004  WL  2346000,  at  *7 
  
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Oct.  15,  2004);  see  also  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-6-402(5).18    In  any 
proceeding concerning child custody and visitation, “the best interests of the child shall be 
the  standard  by  which  the  court  determines  and  allocates  the  parties’  parental 
responsibilities.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-401(a); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a).  
The Tennessee General Assembly has expressed that “[t]he best interests of the child are 
served by a parenting arrangement that best maintains a child’s emotional growth, health 
and stability, and physical care.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-401(a). 

Furthermore,  “trial  courts  are  vested  with  wide  discretion  in  matters  of  child 
custody.’” Schaeffer v. Patterson, No. W2018-02097-COA-R3-JV, 2019 WL 6824903, 
at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 13, 2019) (quoting Johnson v. Johnson, 165 S.W.3d 640, 645 
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2004)).    Appellate  courts  will  not  interfere  with  a  trial  court’s  custody 
determination absent an abuse of discretion.  Dungey v. Dungey, No. M2020-00277-COA-
R3-CV,  2020  WL  5666906,  at  *2  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Sept.  23,  2020) (quoting  C.W.H.  v. 
                                           

17 Section (E)(1) addresses Wife’s sixth issue: “Did the trial court err in designating Husband as 
the  primary  residential  parent  with  sole  decision-making  authority  in  contradiction  of  the  weight  of  the 
evidence?”

18 A primary residential parent is “the parent with whom the child resides more than fifty percent 

(50%) of the time.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-402(4).  

- 35 -

L.A.S.,  538  S.W.3d  488,  495  (Tenn.  2017)).    However,  “[w]hile  ‘the  details  of  child 
custody and visitation arrangements are generally left to the discretion of the trial court . . 
. this discretion is not unbounded.’”  K.B.J. v. T.J., 359 S.W.3d 608, 615-16 (Tenn. Ct. 
App. 2011) (quoting D v. K, 917 S.W.2d 682, 685 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995)).  

Before proceeding to Wife’s substantive issues, we first address the trial court’s oral 
findings  of  fact  and credibility  findings  as  both  significantly  influenced  its  decision 
concerning Saylor.

a.  Trial Court’s Oral Findings

As with  many of the previous issues in this case, a background of the procedural 
history concerning this issue is helpful.  Turning to the record, on July 3, 2019, after closing 
arguments  on  the  final  day  of  trial,  the  trial  court made  extensive  oral  findings  of  fact
concerning  the  Children,  discussed  further,  infra.    Although  the  trial  court  designated 
Husband as Easton’s primary residential parent and granted him decision-making authority 
over Easton’s educational and medical decisions, at this time, the trial court took all issues 
concerning Saylor under advisement.  

The parties returned to court on August 14, 2019, when the trial court held a hearing 
on various post-trial issues, including designating Saylor’s primary residential parent and 
the parent with decision-making authority.  At this hearing, Wife’s counsel represented to 
the trial court that Wife was not present because she was ill.  During the hearing, Husband’s 
counsel alleged  that,  since  the  trial  court’s  July  3,  2019  ruling,  “[Wife]  has  blocked 
[Husband’s] phone number.”  Wife’s counsel objected “to any testimony of facts . . . by 
[Husband’s counsel],” and stated “[i]f we need to have a hearing about what allegations 
he’s  about  to  go  into,  fine.”    Thereafter,  counsel continued  to argue  to  the  trial  court 
concerning whether Wife had blocked Husband’s telephone number.  During this time, it 
was  alleged  that  when  the  telephone  number  for  Wife  was  called  a  message  played 
concerning  a  “Verizon  restriction.”    No  evidence  was  presented  to  the  trial  court 
concerning the issue with Wife’s telephone number.  Despite not receiving any evidence 
and having only the allegations of Husband’s counsel as support, the trial court essentially 
took such allegations as proof of fact, to-wit:

Now I can set this hearing off and I can have another hearing, and [Husband’s 
counsel] can come in and prove this, but see, I’m not going to keep playing 
games with your client.

***

[Wife’s counsel], again, this is why we are where we are.  Your client does 
things that you’re not aware of or you come in and take positions that you 
don’t  have  full  information  and  we  spend  time.    If  your  client  has  cut  off 
- 36 -

[Husband], I want to know that because that is going to affect my decision 
[concerning Saylor].

***

And  I  will  delay  designating  primary  residential  parent  to  take  that  into 
account.

Ultimately, the trial court continued its decision concerning Saylor so Wife could “come 
in to answer for these allegations that have been made against her.”

The  next  day,  the  trial  court  resumed  the  hearing.    Wife  was  again  absent,  her 
counsel representing  that  she  was  at  a minor  medical  center because  she  was  very  ill.  
Wife’s  counsel made  statements  to  the  trial  court  concerning  the  “Verizon  restriction” 
message, to-wit:

I attempted to contact that number on  my cell phone number, received the 
same message: Verizon, we’re sorry, the call cannot be connected, Verizon 
restrictions.  I contacted my client and advised her of that.  She was unaware 
of those restrictions.  She contacted Verizon.  Apparently, there’s a thousand-
dollar balance on the account that she’s been unable to pay, but she is able to 
send and receive text messages.  The [C]hildren’s phones are working. 

Verizon  could  not  tell  her  why  that  number  was  doing  that,  but  it’s  not  a 
blocking of [Husband] issue.  It is an issue with the phone overall.  So I have 
provided  to  counsel  for  [Husband]  this  morning  a  telephone  number  that 
[Husband]  has  confirmed  is  working.    [Wife]  answered  the  phone  this 
morning.

When the trial court asked Husband’s counsel if he agreed with the above statements, he 
responded:

Yes, Your Honor.  Just to add to what [Wife’s counsel] stated.  We did agree 
on phone numbers; however, that [***] number, that is the cell phone number 
that’s with Verizon that we have had shown in [Wife’s] billing records.  The 
phone -- the [C]hildren’s phones are still working, so still a little perplexed 
why  her  phone  isn’t  working  right  now.    But  we  do  have  another  phone 
number . . . .

Thereafter, the trial court questioned:

Trial Court: How does [Wife] explain that? I mean, if all phones are on one 
account,  the  bill  is  past  due,  how  is  she  explaining  that?  How—or  how  is 
- 37 -

Verizon explaining that to her?

Wife’s Counsel: They don’t have an explanation, Your Honor.  That was the 
first thing I instructed her to do when I couldn’t get through on that number 
is to contact them and find out why that number is receiving that  message 
when you call it that there are Verizon restrictions.  She got no answer.  She 
was going to—

Trial Court: So is it still restricted today? 

Wife’s  Counsel:  Yes.  I  mean,  you  can  attempt  to  call  it  from  the  [c]ourt’s 
phone if you’d like, Your Honor. 

Trial Court: Okay. Well, I just don’t find that that’s very credible.

Wife’s Counsel: Well, Your Honor, I would invite the [c]ourt—

Trial Court: I would find it more credible if Verizon verified that.  I just don’t 
find  that  credible. They  would  not  block—why  would  a  phone  company 
block one number and not all numbers associated with that account if it was 
a billing issue?

Wife’s Counsel: I don’t know, Your Honor.  But if the [c]ourt wants to try 
that number so that you can verify—

Trial Court: No, no, no.  I believe that it’s restricted. I have no doubt about 
that.  I just don’t find it credible that the reason that it’s being restricted is 
because of payment when other numbers on that account are working. 

Wife’s Counsel: And I don’t—I agree with you, and that’s why I said what I 
It  has  a  balance,  but  the  other  phones  are  working,  so  I  don't 
said  it.
understand it either. 

Trial  Court:  So  [Wife] could  very  well  just  restrict  her  number  to  anyone 
calling that number, not just [Husband], not just block his number,  maybe 
the whole phone is blocked. 

Wife’s Counsel: What would Your Honor like me to do? 

Trial  Court:  I  don’t  know.  I  just  don’t  find  that  it’s  credible.  And  your 
client’s not here. But if you-all have reached an agreement on that, that’s 
fine. I just don’t think that it’s credible.

- 38 -

Wife’s counsel also represented to the trial court that part of the issue with Wife’s 
telephone  number  was  that  Wife  has  had  multiple  telephone  numbers  throughout  the 
litigation.    We  recall  that  Wife  was  ordered  to  turn  over  her  cell  phone  for  forensic 
evaluation at the beginning of litigation.  Since that time, Wife testified (at trial) that she 
would purchase “burner” phones, resulting in her having different telephone numbers at 
different times.  Thereafter, counsel for both parties continued arguments concerning the 
parties’ communications with each other.  We emphasize that no evidence was presented 
to the trial court concerning the issue with Wife’s telephone number.  Nevertheless, based 
on  the  foregoing  arguments, it  appears  that  the  trial  court  determined  that  Wife  was 
purposefully  blocking  Husband’s  telephone  number  and  not  communicating  with  him.  
When Wife’s counsel argued that Wife was not blocking Husband’s telephone number and 
that  there  was  a  “situation  with  these  phones,”  the  trial  court  stated  “I  don’t  agree  with 
that.”    When  Wife’s  counsel represented  to  the  trial  court  that  Wife  was  unaware  her 
telephone numbers were not working, the trial court stated:

Trial Court: So if she’s—so let me make sure I understand. So your client 
has so many numbers, is so busy, she’s so preoccupied—

Wife’s Counsel: No. 

Trial Court: —that she doesn’t know when she is able to get phone calls, she 
doesn’t know when she misses phone calls, she has—you know, she’s just 
not organized enough to know that she’s not getting important calls from her 
lawyer, from her son, from her soon-to-be ex-husband.  So then if the school 
is attempting to call her and there’s an issue with Saylor and—I mean, there’s 
an emergency, are they going to have to go through this same scenario where 
they  can’t  reach  her  for  a  week  or  the  phone’s  restricted,  but  she  doesn’t 
know  why  or  we’ve  got  four  different  numbers  so  they’ve  got  to  call  four 
numbers to get through to her?  Or is she going to provide them with a phone 
number that is going to be available to them in the event of an emergency? 
Because if she’s having these problems with her lawyer and her children’s 
father,  then  again—see,  you’re  trying  to  explain  the  situation,  and  I 
appreciate  the  situation  that  you’re  in,  but  ultimately,  it  goes  back-to  the 
responsibility and the judgment of [Wife].  And it is just time and time and 
time again, that it’s just the [c]ourt just is having a hard time understanding.

This Court focuses on the foregoing comments by trial court because, later in the 
August  15,  2019  hearing,  the  trial  court  found  that  it  was  in  Saylor’s  best  interest  for 
Husband to be named her primary residential parent with sole decision-making authority.  
In coming to this conclusion, the trial court provided additional commentary and made new 
findings of fact:

- 39 -

Which parent do I believe is mature, is level headed, is able to communicate, 
is  able  to  identify  resources,  consult  those  resources,  has  displayed 
themselves the entire litigation as being professional, as being cooperative, 
has come to court on a regular basis, has never been absent from court for 
important hearings,  who has not claimed to have illnesses, having to go to 
the  doctor  during  important,  you  know  -- having  health  issues,  that  never 
knows  when  -- allegedly  having  health  issues that  you  never  know  when 
they’re  going  to  be  available,  when  they’re  not  going  to  be  available?  If 
something were to happen with the children and emergency decisions had to 
be made, you know, which person is going to be able to stop everything that 
they’re doing and get to the school, get to the phone, identify resources, put 
a plan in action to make sure that the children are well taken care of? 

And again, we have had in the 50 -- of the Dow Jones, the largest one-day 
decline -- the fourth -- in the history of the Dow Jones, the fourth largest --
the  fourth  largest  decline  in  the  history  of  the  Dow  Jones  occurred  on 
yesterday.    And  while  that  was  occurring,  which  parent  was  here?  
[Husband].  And he’s here again today.  And we’re here to make a decision 
about  the  [C]hildren.    And  where’s  [Wife]?    She  was  sick  yesterday  and 
today she’s at a minor med.  Need I say any more?

[Wife] has not shown herself to be reliable, to be trustworthy, to be 
credible  in  many  instances.    The  [c]ourt  has  serious  judgment—serious 
concerns  with  regard  to  her  judgment  in  several  different  instances.    Her 
relationship  with  the  [C]hildren,  even  though  she  has  been  the primary 
residential  parent,  her  guidance—these  children  don’t  need  a  friend,  they 
need a parent.  And [Husband] will be able to monitor.  He’ll be able to make 
those  decisions.    He  won’t—the  [C]hildren won’t  be  caught  in  a  limbo 
situation where they are bootstrapped having to go back and forth between 
lawyers  and  communicate,  taking  weeks  and  weeks  upon  time  to  make 
simple decisions about the children.  I think this will allow the children to 
be—they  will  know  what  to  expect.    It  will  provide  the  stability  that  they 
need. 

[Wife] can be as involved as she would like to be or as little involved 
as she would like to be in those decisions.  That totally rests upon her.  But 
at least the [C]hildren will know at the end of the day that they can sit down

with  their  father  and  that  their  father  is  going  to  do  what’s  in  their  best 
interest.  They know that their father has done what’s in their best interest.  
During this divorce, they were it was implanted in their minds that they were 
that Dad was not—that he was being selfish, that he was not providing for 
them, that their mom didn’t have food, that their mom couldn’t travel, that 
their mom couldn’t—but Mom had a whole lot of money that she spent during 
this case.  There was hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars that she 
utilized.  She chose to utilize those dollars for her attorney.  She liquidated 
assets by agreement and she chose how to use those, but yet she implanted 
in those children’s minds that they  were almost destitute.  That’s what she 
did; no one else.  Dad didn’t do that.  Dad never said, oh, I’m not going to 
give you money for food or you can only have $500 a month for food.  Dad 
never said, you can’t go on vacation.  You can take a vacation with me, but 
Mom, oh, no, you can’t—Dad never said those things.  But these children sat 
down  with  this  [c]ourt  and  they  were  of  the  opinion  that  they  were  being 
treated unfairly and their  mom was being []treated [un]fairly and that Dad 
was the source of that confusion.  Well, now that’s all over with. 

(Emphases added).  The foregoing findings were incorporated into the trial court’s written 
findings of fact and conclusions of law and provided the basis for the trial court’s credibility 
findings, discussed infra.  These findings were also reduced to writing in the trial court’s 
September 11, 2019 order on final decision-making and primary residential parent status 
of the parties’ Children (“order on decision-making and primary residential parent”). 

The above findings are in stark contrast to the findings the trial court made on July 
3, 2019, at the close of trial.  For example, on July 3, 2019, the trial court praised Wife for 
doing 

an  extraordinary  job  adjusting  to  the  changes, [Husband] not  being  in  the 
home,  given some of the financial constraints that she’s had to work with, 
the emotional toll that the divorce has taken upon her, the financial toll it has 
taken upon  her,  she  has  still  remained very  vigilant and  active  in  the 
[C]hildren’s lives, involved very intricately in the details, the planning, the
scheduling.  And even though she acknowledges that there was a period of 
time where she was just off the—I forget how she characterized it, but was 
not as attentive as she would have liked to have been given the pressure that 
she was feeling from her divorce and separation from her husband, she still 
was able to do the best job that she could do under the circumstances with 
the [C]hildren.

On July 3, 2019, the trial court also found “that both parents [were] equally fit in terms of 
their morality, their physical health, their mental health and their emotional fitness.”  The 
trial  court’s  August  15,  2019  findings  characterize  Wife  as  an  unreliable,  unstable, 
- 41 -

deceitful, and manipulative person who is incapable of making good decisions on behalf 
of the Children.  

From our review of the record, the only intervening events between the trial court’s 
disparate findings concerning Wife’s parental fitness were the hearings on August 14 and 
15, 2019.  We deduce from the trial court’s August 15, 2019 oral findings and comments 
as well as its September 11, 2019 order on decision-making and primary residential parent
that  the  trial  court was  frustrated  with  Wife  and  questioned both the  legitimacy  of her 
absence from court and her counsel’s allegations that Wife’s telephone was not working 
properly.  If these two matters concerned the trial court, it should have heard evidence and 
admitted proof  on  the  same,  but  it  did  not  do  so.    Rather,  the  trial  court  relied  on  the 
statements  of  Husband’s  counsel,  discussed supra,  as  evidence  to  support  Husband’s 
allegations  that  Wife  blocked  Husband’s  telephone  number  or  that  Wife  blocked  all 
telephone numbers after the trial.  This reliance is exemplified by the following statements 
from the trial court during the August 14, 2019 hearing:

So [Wife] should be prepared for every phone that she has to account for it.  
I’m not going to have [Husband] testify.  I don’t think that it’s proper, but 
we all know what the issues are.  And I don’t think [Husband’s counsel]—
[Husband’s counsel] has been very credible to this [c]ourt.  I don’t think that 
he’s going to tell this [c]ourt that his client is not able to communicate on the 
phone number that your client is providing and that he’s getting a restricted 
message or recording back.  And I expect your client to come in and tell the 
truth.

Furthermore, the trial court’s September 11, 2019 order on decision-making and primary 
residential  parent shows  the  trial  court’s  reliance  on  statements  made  primarily  by 
Husband’s counsel.  From these statements, we conclude that the trial court’s findings were 
predicated on statements of the parties’ counsel, not on sworn testimony from the parties 
themselves  or  any  other  such  evidence,  e.g.,  an  affidavit  from  Verizon  explaining  why 
Wife’s telephone number was restricted.  Nevertheless, in its September 11, 2019 order, 
the trial court found:

8.  Based upon an ongoing pattern of behavior exhibited by Wife, Husband’s 
inability to contact Wife in a case of an emergency to communicated about 
issues affecting the [C]hildren and Husband having to obtain the assistance 
of the court and Wife’s counsel to obtain a working cellular phone number, 
concerns about Wife’s credibility, and the parties[’] inability to make joint 
decisions  concerning  the  [C]hildren,  the  [c]ourt  finds  that  it  is  in  the 
[C]hildren’s  best interest  that  Husband  have  the  final  decision-making 
authority on all decisions affecting the [C]hildren after consulting with Wife.

After making the above findings, the trial court found:

- 42 -

9.  It is within the trial court’s discretion to permit additional proof after a 
party  has  announced  the  close  of  its  proof  and,  “unless  it  appears  that  its 
action in that regard has permitted injustice, its exercise of discretion will not 
be  disturbed  on  appeal.”    In  re  Faith  F., No.  M2009-02473-COA-R3-JV 
(Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2017) (quoting Simpson v. Fronteir Cmty. Credit 
Union,  810  S.W.,  2d  147,  149  (Tenn.  1991));  see  also,  Higgins  v.  Steide, 
355 S.W. 2d 533, 535 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959).

(Emphasis added).  We reiterate and emphasize that the trial court never reopened proof
during the August hearings.  Rather, it is clear that the trial court relied on statements of 
Husband’s counsel in lieu of proof.  This was an error of law and an abuse of discretion as 
it is well-established that “statements and arguments of counsel are neither evidence nor a 
substitute  for  testimony.”    Elliott  v.  Cobb,  320  S.W.3d  246,  250  (Tenn.  2010) (citing 
Metropolitan Gov’t of Nashville and Davidson County v. Shacklett, 554 S.W.2d 601, 605 
(Tenn. 1977); Hathaway v. Hathaway, 98 S.W.3d 675, 681 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002)).  

On  review,  the  record  shows  that  the  trial  court’s  reliance  on  the  statements  of 
Husband’s  counsel as  proof  that  Wife  blocked  Husband’s  telephone  number  and/or  all 
telephone numbers ostensibly influenced the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions 
of law concerning  Saylor.  This Court will not consider the arguments of counsel at the 
August 14 or 15, 2019 hearings as proof that Wife blocked any telephone numbers from 
calling her, including Husband’s.  This Court’s review of the evidence is limited to that 
which  was  properly  presented  to  the  trial  court.    On  our  review  of  the  record,  no  such 
evidence  was  proffered  to  show  that  Wife  blocked  Husband  from  contacting  her or  that 
there was ever an emergency concerning the Children where Wife was unreachable.  To 
the contrary, the evidence showed that Wife had been reachable during multiple difficult 
situations involving the Children.  We remain mindful of the foregoing procedural history 
and the trial court’s abuse of discretion as we turn to our analysis concerning Saylor.

b.  Credibility Findings

As noted above, the trial court’s August 15, 2019 oral findings also served as the 

basis for the trial court’s credibility findings, to-wit:19  

                                           

19 The footnotes from this portion of the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law cite 
almost exclusively to the August 15, 2019 hearing transcript.  The only other citation is to the trial court’s 
order granting Wife’s oral request for a general continuance entered June 7, 2019.  In this order, the trial 
court found that Wife was unable to attend trial because she allegedly was ill.  Although it is apparent from 
the order that the trial court questioned Wife’s illness, the trial court found that “all parties and counsel 
received documentation regarding Wife’s medical evaluation.”  On this Court’s review of the record, Wife 
was never questioned under oath concerning her alleged illness during this time. 

- 43 -

Based on his testimony, demeanor, and conduct during the pendency 
of  this  case, the  [c]ourt  finds  Husband  has  shown  himself  to  be  reliable, 
forthcoming,  communicative, cooperative,  and  trustworthy.    Husband  was 
not  absent  from  important  court  hearings.    Although  Husband  is  not  the 
perfect spouse or parent, he holds himself accountable for his own failings, 
whether it be his infidelity or the shortcomings in his parenting.  Therefore, 
this [c]ourt finds Husband’s testimony to be credible.

In contrast, Wife[] has shown herself to be not reliable, guarded, not 
available, difficult  to  communicate  with,  irresponsible,  and  untrustworthy.  
Wife has failed to appear in court for the final trial or a subsequent hearing; 
and each explanation Wife offered for those absences were unreliable.  When 
confronted with her failings as a spouse or parent, Wife is defensive, makes 
excuses,  and  blames  others.    Moreover, Wife’s  lack  of  candor  and  the 
irresponsible ways she has prosecuted her own divorce, causes this Court to 
question  her  judgment  in  many  instances. Thus,  this  Court  finds Wife’s 
testimony not credible.

In Wells v. Tennessee Board of Regents, 9 S.W.3d 779 (Tenn. 1999), the Tennessee 

Supreme Court explained that 

trial courts are able to observe witnesses as they testify and to assess their 
demeanor, which best situates trial judges to evaluate witness credibility. See 
State v. Pruett, 788 S.W.2d 559, 561 (Tenn. 1990); Bowman v. Bowman, 
836  S.W.2d  563,  566  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 1991). Thus,  trial  courts  are  in  the 
most  favorable  position  to  resolve  factual  disputes  hinging  on  credibility 
determinations. See  Tenn-Tex  Properties  v.  Brownell-Electro,  Inc.,  778 
S.W.2d 423, 425-26 (Tenn. 1989); Mitchell v. Archibald, 971 S.W.2d 25, 29 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).  Accordingly, appellate courts will not re-evaluate a 
trial  judge’s  assessment  of  witness  credibility  absent  clear  and  convincing 
evidence  to  the  contrary.  See Humphrey  v.  David  Witherspoon,  Inc.,  734 
S.W.2d 315, 315-16 (Tenn. 1987); Bingham v. Dyersburg Fabrics Co., Inc., 
567 S.W.2d 169, 170 (Tenn. 1978).

Wells, 9 S.W.3d at 783.  Although this Court routinely defers to a trial judge’s assessment 
of a witness’ credibility, such findings are not absolute.  Rather, where there is clear and
convincing evidence undermining a trial court’s credibility finding, this Court will reverse 
the finding and proceed with its review on the evidence alone.  Id.

We  conclude  that  there  is  clear  and  convincing  evidence  to  undermine  the  trial 
court’s  credibility  finding.    On  this  Court’s  review,  the  trial  court  made  no  credibility 
findings in its July 3, 2019 oral ruling.  According to the record, the credibility findings the 
trial  court  made  on  August  15,  2019  were  predicated  on  the  statements  of  the  parties’ 
- 44 -

counsel rather than on evidence.  Despite the lack of evidence, the trial court found that 
“Wife’s explanation for providing an inoperable telephone number to Husband [was] not 
credible.”  Similarly, despite not hearing any testimony concerning Wife’s alleged illness, 
the trial court found “Wife’s explanation for her absence in court [was] not credible.”  As 
discussed above, the trial court’s reliance on statements from the parties’ counsel as proof 
was error, and the trial court abused its discretion when it made findings predicated on such 
statements.  Accordingly, we give little weight to the trial court’s credibility findings and 
proceed with our own review of the evidence.

c.  Primary Residential Parent

On September 11, 2019, the trial court entered the final decree of absolute divorce.  

The final decree incorporated, by reference, the trial transcripts from July 3 (the hearing
ending in the early hours of July 4), August 14, August 15, and September 11, 2019.20  The 
trial court also incorporated, inter alia, its written findings of fact and conclusions of law 
and the permanent parenting plan into the final decree.21  As discussed, supra, ultimately, 
                                           

20 It is well-settled in Tennessee that where a trial court incorporates its oral rulings into a written 
order that this Court shall also review the trial court’s oral statements as if they were written into the order.  
Terry v. Jackson-Madison Cty. Gen. Hosp. Dist., 572 S.W.3d 614, 629 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2018) (citation 
omitted).  Generally, the oral statements of a trial court help this Court to better understand a trial court’s 
reasoning and decision.  However, here, the combined pages of transcript that the trial court incorporated 
into the final decree totaled 535 pages and contained arguments of counsel as well as the trial court’s oral 
findings.    Although  this  Court  has  reviewed  the  foregoing  transcripts,  we  caution  trial  courts  to  be 
discerning when incorporating transcripts into orders and to focus on the oral findings that would aid this 
Court in its review.

21 On this Court’s review, the trial court’s written findings of fact and conclusions of law are almost 
identical to Husband’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, an issue that Wife fleetingly raises 
in  her  argument  but  does  not  state  as  an  issue  on appeal.    Briefly,  our  Supreme  Court  has  expressed  a 
preference for trial courts to prepare their own findings of fact and conclusions of law rather than relying 
on those prepared by counsel.  Smith v. UHS of Lakeside, Inc., 439 S.W.3d 303, 314-15 (Tenn. 2014).  
However, the use of party-prepared findings of fact and conclusions of law is not forbidden as long as two 
conditions  are  satisfied.   Id. at  315-16.   “First,  the  findings  and  conclusions  must  accurately  reflect  the 
decision of the trial court.  Second, the record must not create doubt that the decision represents the trial 
court’s own deliberations and decision.”  Id. at 316 (citations omitted).  In short, “the ultimate concern is 
the fairness and independence of the trial court’s judgment.”  Id.; Malone v. Viele, No. E2021-00637-COA-
R3-CV,  2021  WL  6111711,  at  *6  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Dec.  27,  2021)  (concluding  that  the  party-prepared 
findings  and  conclusions  accurately  reflected  the  trial  court’s  decision  and  did  not  cast  doubt  that  the 
decision represented the trial court’s own deliberations).  

This Court has reviewed all of the trial court’s oral rulings from July 3, August 14, August 15, and 
September 11, 2019 and has compared such rulings against the written findings of fact and conclusions of 
law, entered September 11, 2019.  We note that much of the September 11, 2019 hearing was dedicated to 
the trial court reviewing the proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law and editing them to conform 
to the trial court’s ruling.  As it concerns the trial court’s written findings regarding the Children, in its oral 
rulings,  the  trial  court  never  explicitly  found  that  any  of  the  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  36-6-
106(a)(1)-(15) factors, discussed at length, infra, favored one parent over the other, but the trial court made 
such findings in the written findings of facts and conclusions of law.  Nevertheless, and although there is 
- 45 -

the trial court concluded that it was in Saylor’s best interest for Husband to be named her 
primary  residential  parent  with  sole  decision-making  authority,  after  consultation  with 
Wife.  The trial court also ordered that the parties continue the week-to-week schedule they 
had been operating under in the temporary parenting plan.  Although Wife does not appeal 
the  trial  court’s  “week-to-week”  schedule,  she  appeals  the  designation  of  Husband  as 
Saylor’s  primary  residential  parent  and  his  sole  decision-making  authority.    We  turn  to 
those issues now.

When fashioning a residential schedule, the trial court is instructed to

make  residential  provisions  for  each  child,  consistent  with  the  child’s 
developmental  level  and  the  family’s  social  and  economic  circumstances, 
which  encourage  each  parent  to  maintain  a  loving,  stable,  and  nurturing 
relationship  with  the  child.  .  .  .    If  the  limitations  of  §  36-6-406  are  not 
dispositive of the child’s residential schedule,22 the court shall consider the 
factors found in § 36-6-106(a)(1)-(15).23

                                           
one other discrepancy, discussed further, infra, the written findings of fact and conclusions of law generally 
reflect the trial court’s own deliberations.  Still, we urge trial courts to prepare their own findings of facts 
and conclusions of law and not to rely solely on that which has been prepared by the parties. 

22  Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-406 instructs a court to limit the residential time for a 
parent that has engaged in certain specified conduct or who exhibits certain traits, including, in pertinent 
part:  (1) willful  abandonment;  (2)  physical  or  sexual  abuse;  (3)  emotional  abuse;  (4)  neglect  or 
nonperformance  of  parental  duties;  or  (5)  an  emotional  or  physical  impairment  which  interferes  with 
parental  responsibilities.  Neither  party  argues  that  the  trial  court  should  have  used  Tennessee  Code 
Annotated section 36-6-406 to limit residential time with either parent.

23 The factors set out at Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-106(a)(1)-(15) are:

(1) The strength, nature, and stability of the child’s relationship with each parent, including 
whether one (1) parent has performed the majority of parenting responsibilities relating to 
the daily needs of the child;

(2)  Each  parent’s  or  caregiver’s  past  and  potential  for  future  performance  of  parenting 
responsibilities, including the willingness and ability of each of the parents and caregivers 
to  facilitate  and  encourage  a  close  and  continuing  parent-child  relationship  between  the 
child  and  both  of  the  child’s  parents,  consistent  with  the  best  interest  of  the  child.  In 
determining  the  willingness  of  each  of  the  parents  and  caregivers  to  facilitate  and 
encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between the child and both of 
the child’s parents, the court shall consider the likelihood of each parent and caregiver to 
honor and facilitate court ordered parenting arrangements and rights, and the court shall 
further consider any  history  of  either parent  or any caregiver  denying parenting time to 
either parent in violation of a court order;

(3) Refusal to attend a court ordered parent education seminar may be considered by the 
court as a lack of good faith effort in these proceedings;

- 46 -

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-404(b).  “In taking into account the child’s best interest, the court 
shall  order  a  custody  arrangement  that  permits  both  parents  to  enjoy  the  maximum 
participation possible in the life of the child consistent with the factors set out [above], the 
location of the residences of the parents, the child’s need for stability and all other relevant 
factors.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a).  

We begin our review with Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-106(a)(1), which 
looks  at  the  “strength,  nature,  and  stability  of  the  child’s  relationship  with  each  parent, 
including whether one (1) parent has performed the majority of parenting responsibilities 
                                           

(4) The disposition of each parent to provide the child with food, clothing, medical care, 
education and other necessary care;

(5) The degree to which a parent has been the primary caregiver, defined as the parent who 
has taken the greater responsibility for performing parental responsibilities;

(6) The love, affection, and emotional ties existing between each parent and the child;

(7) The emotional needs and developmental level of the child;

(8) The moral, physical, mental and emotional fitness of each parent as it relates to their 
ability to parent the child. . . .

(9)  The  child’s  interaction  and  interrelationships  with  siblings,  other  relatives  and  step-
relatives,  and  mentors,  as  well  as  the  child’s  involvement  with  the  child’s  physical 
surroundings, school, or other significant activities;

(10) The importance of continuity in the child’s life and the length of time the child has 
lived in a stable, satisfactory environment;

(11) Evidence  of physical or  emotional abuse to the  child, to the  other parent or to any 
other person. The court shall, where appropriate, refer any issues of abuse to juvenile court 
for further proceedings;

(12) The character and behavior of any other person who resides in or frequents the home 
of a parent and such person’s interactions with the child;

(13) The reasonable preference of the child if twelve (12) years of age or older. The court 
may hear the preference of a younger child upon request. The preference of older children 
should normally be given greater weight than those of younger children;

(14)  Each  parent’s  employment  schedule,  and  the  court  may  make  accommodations 
consistent with those schedules; and

(15) Any other factors deemed relevant by the court.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(1)-(15).  We note that this was the version of the statute in effect when 
Wife filed her initial complaint for divorce and that all of the statutes referenced herein are the versions that 
were in effect when the initial complaint was filed.

relating to the daily needs of the child.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(1).  Despite the 
overwhelming  evidence  that  Wife  has  been  Saylor’s  primary  caretaker,  in  its  written 
findings,  the  trial  court  found  that  this  factor  favored  Husband.    The  evidence  does  not 
support  this  finding.    Saylor  testified  that  even  when  Wife  worked  as  the  Global 
Communications Director for W&A, Inc., she was still “full time with the kids.”24  Both 
Children testified that, before the divorce, they did not spend much time with Husband as 
he  would  “come  home  late”  or  “go  out  of  town  a  lot.”    When  Husband  was  home,  the 
Children  testified  that  he  would  “usual[ly]”  come  home  at  dinner  and  would  “go  in  his 
office and then [the Children and Wife] would just . . . be in the family room and kitchen 
area.”  The Children’s testimony was corroborated by Ms. Alison Kosman and Ms. Nicole 
Beers.  Ms. Kosman worked as Wife’s personal assistant prior to the divorce.  She testified 
that Wife was the parent who cooked the Children’s dinner, helped with their homework, 
and attended their extra-curricular activities.  Similarly, Ms. Beers, who was hired prior to 
the divorce to help with the Children, testified that Wife was the parent who handled the 
Children’s schedules and everything related to their care.  She further testified that Wife 
was the parent who would sit with the Children to discuss their days and help with their 
homework.  She also testified that, when Husband was in town, he arrived home around 
dinner time, said hello to the Children, and then would leave the room and not eat dinner 
with them.  In his testimony, Husband admitted that, prior to the divorce, his usual practice 
was not to eat dinner with the Children nor discuss their days with them.  Wife testified 
that she was the parent who arranged all of the Children’s doctor’s appointments, camps, 
and extra-curricular activities.  Wife also testified that she was the day-to-day parent who 
cooked the Children dinner and helped them with their homework.

As mentioned above, on July 2, 2018, the parties entered into a temporary parenting 
plan, under which the Children would alternate weeks with the parents.  The record shows 
that, at this time, Husband began assuming more parenting responsibilities, and he made 
an effort to be home at a regular time to have dinner with the Children.  Husband testified 
that he adjusted his work schedule so he traveled on the weeks the Children were not with 
him.  However, the record shows that the paternal grandmother provides considerable care 
for  the  Children  during  Husband’s  parenting time.    According  to  the  record,  both  the 
paternal  grandmother  and  Husband’s  assistant transport  the  Children,  and  the  Children 
testified  that  the  paternal  grandmother  cooks  and  cleans  for  them.    Saylor  testified  that 
Husband  is  “gone  a  lot,  so  when  [she’s]  at  his  house,  [she]  feel[s]  more  alone  because 
[she’s] just . . . in [her] room the whole time[.]”  Concerning her relationship with each 
parent,  Saylor  testified  that,  although  she  is close  with Husband,  she  has a  closer 
relationship  with  Wife.    Given  the  foregoing,  the  trial  court  erred  in  not  assigning 
significant weight to Wife’s role as Saylor’s primary caregiver.  

                                           

24  After the Children testified in camera, the trial court commented to the parties that the Children’s 

testimonies “were very legitimate, were very credible, [and] were very helpful.”  

- 48 -

We  note  that  the  trial  court  made  additional  written  findings  as  to  this  factor 
concerning  the  parties’  ability  to  communicate  with  each  other  and  to  make  decisions 
jointly.  We discuss these findings below in our review of the trial court’s designation of 
Husband as the parent with decision-making authority.

The second factor asks courts to consider “[e]ach parent’s . . . past and potential for 
future performance of parenting responsibilities, including the willingness and ability of 
each  of  the  parents  .  .  .  to  facilitate  and  encourage  a  close  and  continuing  parent-child 
relationship between the child and . . . the parents, consistent with the best interest of the 
child.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(2).  In its July 3, 2019 oral ruling, the trial court 
found that

[i]n terms of encouraging and facilitating a close and continuing relationship, 
there needs to be more flexibility between [Husband] and [Wife] putting the 
[C]hildren’s needs first, recognizing that they are both young teens now and 
that they have their own schedules, their own agenda, their own desires. . . . 
So in terms of facilitating and encouraging, there wasn’t much testimony on 
that.  

In its written findings, the trial court found that “[b]oth parties are equally qualified as it 
relates to their past and potential performance of parenting responsibilities.”  Also, in its 
written  findings,  the  trial  court  found  that  “[b]oth  parties  can  encourage  a  close  and 
continuing parent-child relationship between each child and the other parent.”  Despite the 
foregoing, the trial court also found that this factor favored Husband, to-wit:

Husband  has  made  consistent  efforts  to  act  in  the  best  interest  of  the 
[C]hildren  by  shielding  them  from  this  litigation.    In  contrast,  the  [c]ourt 
finds  Wife  has  failed  to  consistently  encourage  a  close  and  healthy 
relationship between the [C]hildren and Husband.  For example, during the 
litigation, Wife has implanted into the [C]hildren’s minds that their father is 
selfish, not providing for them, their mother has no money for food or travel, 
despite Wife utilizing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

These written findings reflect the trial court’s oral ruling from August 15, 2019, discussed 
supra.  

Turning to the record, it is clear that the Children were negatively affected by the 
divorce.  Easton testified that it seemed like his parents were “at war,” and Dr. Wanat’s
testimony showed that the Children were exhausted by the divorce proceedings.  It is also 
clear that the Children are very intelligent and observant.  In their testimony, they expressed 
concern over whether Wife was “going to have any money” and whether they were “still 
going to have the house” when the divorce was finalized.  The evidence does not show that 
this  concern  was  the  result  of  Wife  “implant[ing]”  anything  into  the  Children’s  minds; 
- 49 -

rather,  the  Children’s  concerns  were based  on  their  own  observations of  the  parties and 
circumstances.  As Easton testified, he had “gathered [that Wife] has had a pretty big purse 
. . . with a lot of different debit and credit cards,” but “a lot more recently, every time she 
tries  to  use  one,  they  always  say  it’s  been  maxed  out  or  it’s  declined.”    The  following 
testimony  further  shows  that  Wife  actually  declined  to  discuss  the  litigation  with  the 
Children: 

Trial Court:  But really, I am so sorry that you all have had to worry about 
this. I did not know that you all were worried about your finances.  But your 
parents are—have prepared.

Saylor: We aren’t worried about, like, ours.  We’re worried about our mom’s. 

Easton:  We  know  the  parents  are  going  to  take  care  of  us;  that’s  not  the 
question.  The question is, what’s happening to our parents because no one’s 
able to tell us anything?

Trial  Court:  Well,  they’re  not  supposed  to  talk  to  you  about  the  case,  and 
they don’t want to worry you.  But your dad and your mom—

Easton: See, that’s what worries us more.  Since no one is telling us anything, 
all we do is assume. 

Saylor: That’s not a good way.

In view of the foregoing, the evidence preponderates against the trial court’s finding that 
this factor favored Husband.  We conclude that this factor does not weigh in either party’s 
favor.

The  third  factor  concerns  a  party’s “refusal  to  attend  a  court  ordered  parent 
education  seminar[.]”    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-6-106(a)(3).    Both  parties  completed  this 
requirement, and the trial court found this factor inapplicable.  We agree.

Concerning the fourth factor, i.e., “[t]he disposition of each parent to provide the 
child with food, clothing, medical care, education and other necessary care,” Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(4), the trial court found that this factor favored both parties equally.  
The record supports this finding.  

The fifth factor is “[t]he degree to which a parent has been the primary caregiver, 
defined  as  the  parent  who  has  taken  the  greater  responsibility  for  performing  parental 
responsibilities.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(5).  Concerning this factor, the trial court 
found:

- 50 -

Wife  was  the  primary  caregiver  during  the  marriage;  however,  since  the 
separation, Husband has reconciled his family’s needs with the demands of 
his  career. 
  Thus,  both  parties  have  equally  performed  parental 
responsibilities.  This factor favors both parties.

As  discussed  at  length,  supra,  the  evidence  preponderates  against  the  trial  court’s 
conclusion  that  this  factor  favors  both  parties.    The  record  shows  that  Wife  has  been
Saylor’s primary caregiver and has shouldered the majority of parenting responsibilities.
This factor unquestionably favors Wife.

Turning to the sixth factor, i.e., “[t]he love, affection, and emotional ties existing 
between each parent and the child,” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(6), the trial court found 
that this factor favored both parties.  Although the record shows that Saylor is bonded more 
closely with Wife, the record also supports the trial court’s finding that Husband was is 
sensitive to the Child’s feelings, emotionally connected to her, and able to have meaningful 
conversations with her.  We agree that this factor favors the parties equally.

Factor seven asks courts to consider “[t]he emotional needs and developmental level 
of the child.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(7).  In its written findings, the trial court 
found that “[w]hile Wife was able to meet the emotional and developmental needs of the 
[C]hildren  when  they  were  younger,  Husband’s  parenting  style  best  meets  their  current 
emotional and developmental needs.”   Accordingly, the trial court found that this factor 
favored Husband.  In so doing, the trial court focused on Husband’s and Wife’s decisions
concerning  Easton  and  his  behavioral  and  learning  challenges.    The  trial  court  made  no 
written  findings  concerning  Saylor’s  emotional  or  developmental  needs.    As  discussed, 
supra, Saylor is bonded more closely with Wife.  The record also shows that, while Wife 
has been Saylor’s primary caregiver, Saylor has excelled in school, participated in many 
extra-curricular activities, had many friends, and has been emotionally stable.  Although 
Wife  testified  that  she  was  concerned  that  the  divorce  was  causing  Saylor  anxiety,  the 
record shows that Saylor is a well-adjusted child.  Accordingly, as it concerns Saylor, the 
evidence preponderates against the trial court’s finding that this factor favored Husband.  
From the evidence, we conclude that this factor favors Wife.

Factor eight concerns “[t]he moral, physical, mental and emotional fitness of each 
parent  as  it  relates  to  their  ability  to  parent  the  child  .  .  .  .”    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-6-
106(a)(8).  As discussed above, in its July 3, 2019 oral findings, the trial court found that 
each parent was morally, physically, mentally, and emotionally fit to parent the Children.  
The trial court changed this finding on August 15, 2019, discussed supra.  Although the 
trial court’s written findings of fact and conclusions of law found that “[b]oth parties [were] 
equally fit in terms of their moral, physical, mental, and emotional health,” the trial court 
“took  issue”  with  an  incident involving  Saylor  that occurred during  the  divorce and 
concluded that this factor favored Husband.  For discretion, this Court will not discuss what 
transpired with the Child.  However, on our review, Wife’s response to the incident was in 
- 51 -

no way improper, and we conclude that the trial court erred in drawing an adverse opinion 
of Wife based on this occurrence.  Although the trial court found that “Husband has acted 
appropriately in parenting the parties’ [C]hildren,” there was evidence concerning some of 
Husband’s  parenting  decisions  that  were questionable.    Without  enumerating  those 
questionable  decisions,  suffice  it  to  say  that  these  decisions  do  not  cause  this  Court  to 
question Husband’s fitness or ability to parent Saylor.  Based on the proof in the record,
the evidence preponderates against the trial court’s finding that this factor favors Husband, 
and we conclude that this factor favors the parties equally.

Factor nine is:

The  child’s  interaction  and  interrelationships  with  siblings,  other  relatives 
and step-relatives, and mentors, as well as the child’s involvement with the 
child’s physical surroundings, school, or other significant activities.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(9).  In its July 3, 2019 oral ruling, the trial court stated that 
it would not separate the Children because they interacted well together and because Saylor 
looked up to her brother.  In its written findings, the trial court found: 

The  [C]hildren  interact  with  each  other  well.    It  also  appears  that  the 
[C]hildren have positive interactions with their paternal grandmother.  The 
paternal  grandmother  on  occasion  provides  childcare  and  transports  the 
[C]hildren.  Consequently, this factor favors a parenting arrangement where 
the [C]hildren will be together and interact with their paternal grandmother.

From  our review,  the  trial  court  made  no finding  that  this  factor  favored  either  parent.
Concerning  the  trial  court’s  finding  that  the  Children  were  bonded  with  their  paternal 
grandmother  and  that  she  “on  occasion  provide[d]  childcare  and  transport[ation],”  the 
record shows that the paternal grandmother provides this care when Husband is unable to 
care for the Children during his parenting time.  We also note that Saylor testified that she 
prefers staying at Wife’s house because it is closer to her friends, and she feels isolated at 
Husband’s house because it is a long distance from all of her friends.  Accordingly, while 
we agree that this factor favors a parenting arrangement where the Children stay together, 
it also favors a parenting arrangement where Saylor primarily resides at Wife’s residence.  
As such, this factor favors Wife.

The  trial  court  found  that  factor  ten,  i.e.,  “[t]he  importance  of  continuity  in  the 
child’s life and the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment,” 
Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-6-106(a)(10),  favored  both  parties  equally.    As  support  for  this 
conclusion,  the  trial  court  found  that  “[t]he  parties  have  navigated  the  week-to-week 
schedule since the entry of the . . . [t]emporary [p]arenting [p]lan,” and “it appears that the 
[C]hildren have adjusted to the week-to-week schedule.”  The record shows that Saylor has 
lived  in  the  marital  residence for  over  eight  years  (the  majority  of  her  life),  that  she
- 52 -

considers that residence as “home,” and that she desires to continue residing with Wife.  
As  discussed  above,  Saylor  testified  that  she  feels lonely  and  isolated  at  Husband’s 
residence while Wife’s residence is a stable and loving environment.  This is exemplified 
by the evidence that the Children asked to stay with Wife during their final exams because 
they found that environment more supportive and conducive to study.  Although there is 
no  evidence  to  show  that  Husband’s  residence  is  unsatisfactory,  it  is  clear  that  Wife’s 
residence  provides  stability  and  continuity  for  Saylor.    Accordingly,  the  evidence 
preponderates against the trial court’s conclusion that this factor favors the parties equally.  
We conclude that this factor favors Wife.

The  eleventh  factor  considers  “[e]vidence  of  physical  or  emotional  abuse  to  the 
child  [or]  to  the  other  parent[.]”    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-6-106(a)(11).    Although  Wife 
testified that Husband was abusive, the trial court found such allegations “unfounded and 
not credible.”  Accordingly, the trial court found that neither the parties nor the Children 
were abused by either parent or any other person, and that the factor was inapplicable.  The 
evidence  does  not  preponderate  against  the  trial  court’s  finding  that  this  factor  is 
inapplicable.

Concerning the twelfth factor, i.e., “[t]he character and behavior of any other person 
who resides in or frequents the home of a parent and such person’s interactions with the 
child,” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(12), the trial court found this factor inapplicable.  
Although the record shows that the paternal grandmother frequents Husband’s home and 
is often responsible for caring for the Children during Husband’s parenting time, there is 
no evidence that her character or behavior is such that she should not interact with Saylor.  

The thirteenth factor requires courts to consider “[t]he reasonable preference of the 
child if twelve (12) years of age or older.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(13).  At the 
time of her testimony, Saylor was thirteen years old.  Although the trial court stated, in its 
written findings, that “[t]his factor is considered,” it made no determination as to whether
the factor favored either party.  In pertinent part, the trial court found that “[t]he [C]hildren 
expressed  that  they  wanted  to  live  with  both  of  their  parents,”  and  “[w]hen  Saylor  was 
asked  what  would  constitute  her  ‘ideal’  living  arrangement,  she  stated  that  she  did  not 
know”  but  expressed  “that  she  preferred  having  the  exchanges  on  Mondays  instead  of 
Sundays.”  The transcript of the Children’s testimony supports the trial court’s finding that 
the Children desired to live with both parents and that Saylor preferred Monday exchanges.  
Although  Saylor  testified  that  she  did  not  know her  “ideal  [living]  situation,” from  her 
statements, it appears that she was uncomfortable providing such opinion because she knew
that her parents would read the transcript of her testimony:

Wife’s Counsel: So Saylor, when Easton said that he wanted to live at Mom’s 
house, you nodded, but before you said you didn’t know.  Can you share with 
us what you’re thinking? 

- 53 -

Saylor: I don’t feel very comfortable with them reading it.   

Despite her hesitancy, Saylor later testified:

Mom is like—she’s, like, always there.  She’s, like, mainly, like, helping us.  
All the time, us before her.  

And my dad’s like—I get along better with my mom because we’ve always 
been, like, the closer ones.  And yeah.  But when I’m with my dad, it’s like 
two guys in the house, oh, my gosh.  But I mean, we don’t always get along, 
my dad and I.  But yeah, I’m closer with my mom, but still close to my dad.

We infer from Saylor’s testimony that, although she desires to spend time with Husband, 
she prefers to live primarily with Wife; however, it is clear that she was afraid to convey 
this  in  her  testimony  because  she  knew  both  parents  would  read  the  transcript.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports that this factor favors Wife.

The  trial  court  concluded  that  the  fourteenth  factor,  i.e.,  “[e]ach  parent’s 
employment  schedule,”  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-6-106(a)(14),  favored  both  parties.    The 
trial court found that “Husband’s employment schedule is conducive to the week-to-week 
schedule,” and, “[a]lthough Wife is not employed, she will be seeking employment in the 
future which should also be conducive to the week-to-week schedule.”  Wife testified that 
she  did  not  have  any  plans  concerning  employment,  but  that  she  hoped  to  work  in  the 
future.  As discussed, supra, Husband altered his work schedule so that he travels on the 
weeks he does not have the Children.  Accordingly, the record supports the trial court’s 
finding that this factor favors both parties.

The  final  factor  courts  consider  is  a  catchall  provision,  i.e.,  “[a]ny  other  factors 
deemed relevant by the court.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a)(15).  Regarding this factor, 
in its oral findings from July 3, 2019, the trial court expressed concern regarding Easton’s 
educational and behavioral challenges and explained why it believed Husband was better 
suited to make educational and medical decisions on Easton’s behalf.  The trial court also 
discussed its concern regarding the incident with Saylor, mentioned supra.  However, the 
trial court took the primary residential parent designation and decision-making authority 
concerning Saylor under advisement.  Later, in its written findings for this factor, the trial 
court granted Husband decision-making authority.  As such, we review the findings in that 
context.

In a recent decision from this Court, we reiterated that, when fashioning a permanent 

parenting plan,

[t]rial courts are not simply to perform a rote examination of each factor and 
tally  up  those  in  favor  of  each  party. Beaty v. Beaty,  No.  M2020-00476-
- 54 -

COA-R3-CV,  2021  WL  2850585,  at  *3  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  July  8,  2021) 
(quoting Steakin v. Steakin, No.  M2017-00115-COA-R3-CV,  2018  WL 
334445  at  *5  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Jan.  9,  2018)).  Instead,  the  relevancy  and 
weight  of  the  factors  depend  on the  specific  circumstances  of  the 
case. Id. Indeed, any one factor may prove determinative in the trial court’s 
analysis of an appropriate parenting plan. Grissom v. Grissom, 586 S.W.3d 
387,  393  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2019)  (quoting Solima v. Solima, No.  M2014-
01452-COA-R3-CV,  2015  WL  459134,  at  *4  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  July  30, 
2015)). 

Bean v. Bean, No. M2022-00394-COA-R3-CV, 2022 WL 17830533, at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
Dec. 21, 2022).  From the record, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in 
designating Husband as Saylor’s primary residential parent.  The evidence clearly shows 
that: (1) Wife has been Saylor’s primary residential parent; (2) Saylor has a closer bond 
with Wife and prefers to stay at Wife’s residence; and (3) while in Wife’s primary care, 
Saylor has excelled in school and is an intelligent, emotionally stable, and well-adjusted 
child.  The record shows that the parenting arrangement that would best maintain Saylor’s 
emotional growth, health and stability, and physical care is one where Wife is her primary 
residential  parent.    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-6-401(a).    Accordingly,  we  reverse  the  trial 
court’s designation of Husband as Saylor’s primary residential parent and designate Wife 
as Saylor’s primary residential parent.

d.  Decision-Making Authority

As set out above, a permanent parenting plan shall also:

Allocate decision-making authority to one (1) or both parties regarding the 
child’s  education,  health  care,  extracurricular  activities,  and  religious 
upbringing. The  parties  may  incorporate  an  agreement  related  to  the  care 
and growth of the child in these specified areas, or in other areas, into their 
plan, consistent with the criteria in this part.  Regardless of the allocation of 
decision making in the parenting plan, the parties may agree that either parent 
may make emergency decisions affecting the health or safety of the child;

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-404(a)(5).  We recall our General Assembly’s stated findings 
concerning this issue, to-wit: 

Parents have the responsibility to make decisions and perform other parental 
duties  necessary  for  the  care  and  growth  of  their  minor  children.    In  any 
proceeding between parents under this chapter, the best interests of the child 
shall be the standard by which the court determines and allocates the parties’
parental responsibilities. . . .  The general assembly finds the need for stability 
and consistency in children’s lives.

- 55 -

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-401(a)(1).

When determining how to structure decision-making authority on behalf of a child, 

trial courts are required to consider, in pertinent part, the following:

(2) The history of participation of each parent in decision making in each of 
the following areas: physical care, emotional stability, intellectual and moral 
development, health, education, extracurricular activities, and religion; and 
whether each parent attended a court-ordered parent education seminar;

(3) Whether the parents have demonstrated the ability and desire to cooperate 
with  one  another  in  decision  making  regarding  the  child  in  each  of  the 
following  areas:  physical  care,  emotional  stability,  intellectual  and  moral 
development, health, education, extracurricular activities, and religion; and

(4)  The  parents’ geographic  proximity  to  one  another,  to  the  extent  that  it 
affects their ability to make timely mutual decisions.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-407(c).  As an initial matter, it is undisputed that the parties are 
unable to make decisions jointly.  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in awarding one 
parent sole decision-making authority after consultation with the other parent.  

Although the trial court did not make specific findings concerning Tennessee Code 
Annotated section 36-6-407(c), the following written findings of fact and conclusions of 
law are applicable to the issue of decision-making authority:

During  the  marriage,  Husband  has  attempted  to  be  involved  in  the
educational decisions made over the course of these [C]hildren’s lives, but 
Wife would not allow it and ma[d]e unilateral decisions to the detriment of 
the [C]hildren. Husband was not an absent parent but has done everything 
possible for his family.  During the litigation, Husband has consistently made 
efforts to include Wife in the decision-making process while considering a 
variety of options and professionals, such as teachers or counselors.  Also, 
during the litigation, Wife had difficulties communicating with Husband, her 
own lawyer  and  other  professionals,  thereby  placing  the  C]hildren  in  the 
middle. This factor favors Husband.

Given  the  unusually  high  level  of  litigation  and acrimony  between  the 
parties, the [c]ourt doubts their ability to make joint decisions affecting the 
minor children without resorting to litigation or the [C]hildren unnecessarily 

***

- 56 -

being in the middle of the parties’ disagreements.  Thus, it is imperative for 
this  [c]ourt  to  designate  a  sole  decision  maker  on decisions  affecting  the 
[C]hildren.

When it comes to making decisions affecting the minor children, Husband 
has shown that he can communicate with Wife and the [C]hildren; identify 
resources  and options;  and  consult  those  resources  and  options  prior  to 
deciding. Further, Husband has shown himself to be cooperative and readily 
accessible in the event of an emergency; however, the same cannot be said 
of Wife.  The [c]ourt finds the [C]hildren’s education needs are paramount.  
Unfortunately,  Easton  has  struggled  academically  and  behaviorally,
attending three (3) schools in three (3) years, despite Wife being the primary 
caretaker and making unilateral decisions.  Saylor’s schooling choices in the 
future will be a potential issue. To avoid situations where the [C]hildren are 
placed  in  the  middle,  the  [c]ourt must  award  a  parent  the  final  decision-
making ability.  Husband is best suited to ensure the [C]hildren’s needs are 
met; and this [c]ourt has confidence in Husband’s decision-making ability. 
As such, this factor favors Husband.

We  note  that  many  of  the  above written findings  were  taken  from  the  trial  court’s oral 
findings of August 15, 2019.

Turning to the record, the majority of evidence regarding decision-making on behalf 
of the Children concerned Easton.  The record shows that, although the parties differed in 
their approaches and opinions concerning the best course of action for Easton’s future, both 
parents  made  decisions  on  Easton’s  behalf  that  they  thought  would  benefit  him.    Both
parents testified that, although they tried to engage the other parent in decisions involving 
Easton, the other parent was often non-responsive and non-communicative.  This resulted 
in  both parties  making unilateral  decisions  on  behalf  of  the  child.    However,  the  record 
shows that Wife was the parent who, more often than not, elicited the help of professionals 
on  Easton’s  behalf.    Although  not  an  “absent  parent,”  the  record  shows  that  Husband’s 
employment  often  took  him  away  from  the  family,  which  resulted  in  him  not  being  as 
actively involved in decisions concerning the Children.  As discussed above, the trial court 
also drew adverse opinions concerning Wife’s judgment and ability to parent Saylor after 
an incident involving the Child.  As articulated, supra, this Court does not draw the same 
opinions, and we conclude that Wife handled the situation appropriately and in a manner 
that allowed her to continue to have a close relationship with Saylor, and with the Child 
being able to confide in her.  We also reiterate that there is no evidence to show that Wife 
was not “readily accessible in the event of an emergency.”  Rather, the record shows that
Wife was “readily accessible” when the Children needed her.  In fact, little evidence was 
presented  concerning  Saylor  other  than  proof  that  she excelled  in  school  and  was  well-
adjusted.  Indeed, the record shows that Wife has made more decisions on Saylor’s behalf
than  Husband, and  those  decisions  have  led  to  Saylor  being  an  intelligent,  driven,  and 
- 57 -

compassionate teenager.  Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion 
in awarding Husband sole decision-making authority over Saylor, and we award Wife sole 
decision-making authority over Saylor after consultation with Husband.

2.  Child Support Award

a.  Post-Divorce25

Wife challenges the trial court’s denial of an upward deviation in child support as 
well as the duration of the award.  As this Court has explained, “[pa]rents have ‘deeply 
rooted moral responsibilities’ to support their minor children.”  Richardson v. Spanos, 189 
S.W.3d 720, 724 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005) (internal citations omitted).  “In addition to this 
moral responsibility, Tennessee law imposes a legal obligation on parents to support their 
minor children in a manner commensurate with their own means and station in life.”  Id.
(citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 34-1-102(a); Wade v. Wade, 115 S.W.3d 917, 920 (Tenn. Ct.
App. 2002)).  “Awards of child support are governed by the Child Support Guidelines [(the 
“Guidelines”)] promulgated  by  the  Tennessee  Department  of  Human  Services  Child 
Support Services Division.”  Taylor v. Fezell, 158 S.W.3d 352, 357 (Tenn. 2005).26  When 
determining a child support award, trial courts shall apply the Guidelines as a rebuttable 
presumption.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-101(e)(1)(A).  “The[] Guidelines are a minimum 
base for determining child support obligations,” and the presumptive child support amount 
“may be increased according to the best interest of the child . . . [and] the circumstances of 
the  parties[.]”    Tenn.  Comp.  R.  &  Regs.  1240-02-04-.01(4).    “Because  child  support 
decisions retain an element of discretion, we review them using the deferential ‘abuse of 
discretion’ standard.”  Richardson, 189 S.W.3d at 725.  

The  trial  court  found  that  child  support  should  be  calculated  using  Husband’s 
earning  capacity  of  $1,000,000.00 gross  income  per  year  and  no  income  for  Wife.  
Applying this gross income, under the Guidelines, Husband’s presumptive child support 
obligation  was  $3,200.00 per  month for  two  children  and  $2,100.00 per  month  for one 
child.  Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.07(2)(g)(1)(i), (ii).  In its findings of facts and 
conclusions of law, the trial court determined Husband’s support obligation in accordance 

                                           

25 Section  (E)(2)(a)  addresses  Wife’s  seventh  issue:  “Did  the  trial  court  err  in  determining  the 

amount and duration of the child support award?”

26  We note that there have been three versions of the Guidelines in effect during the pendency of 
this  case,  the  August  2008  version,  the  May  2020  version,  and  the  October  2021  version  (current);  the 
August 2008 version applies here.  The 2008 Guidelines apply in “every judicial . . . action to establish . . . 
child support . . ., whether the action is filed before or after the effective date of [the Guidelines], where a 
hearing  which  results  in  an  order  .  .  .  modifying  .  .  .  support  is  held  after  the  effective  date  of  [the 
Guidelines].”  Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.01(2)(a).  Wife filed  her complaint for divorce  on 
August 4, 2017, and the trial court heard the issue of child support at the trial in 2019.  Because the hearing 
that resulted in an order of child support occurred after the August 2008 effective date but before the May 
2020 effective date, the 2008 Guidelines apply to this case.

with the presumption in the Guidelines and denied Wife’s request for an upward deviation

because  Husband  will  be  paying  the  Special  Expenses  of  the  [C]hildren.  
Wife will receive $3,200[.00] per month for two children to feed, entertain, 
transport, clothe, house, and provide for their needs. 

In  the  permanent  parenting  plan,  the  trial  court  ordered  that  “[Husband]  shall  pay  the 
reasonable  and  necessary  educational  expenses,  extracurricular  activities  and  special 
expenses of the [C]hildren.”  

The  Guidelines  provide  for  “extraordinary  expenses,”  including  educational 
expenses  and  special  expenses.    “Extraordinary  expenses  are  in  excess  of  the[]  average 
amounts and are highly variable among families.”  Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-
.07(2)(d).    Accordingly,  such  expenses  “are  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis  in  the 
calculation of support and are added to the basic support award as a deviation so that the 
actual  amount  of  the  expense  is  considered  in  the  calculation  of  the  final  child  support 
order[.]”    Tenn.  Comp.  R.  &  Regs.  1240-02-04-.07(2)(d).    The  Guidelines  provide  that 
extraordinary educational expenses 

(i) .  .  .  may  be  added  to  the  presumptive  child  support  as  a  deviation. 
Extraordinary educational expenses include, but are not limited to, tuition, 
room  and  board,  lab  fees,  books,  fees,  and  other  reasonable  and  necessary 
expenses  associated  with  special  needs  education  or  private  elementary 
and/or  secondary  schooling  that  are  appropriate  to  the  parents’  financial 
abilities and to the lifestyle of the child if the parents and child were living 
together. 

(iii)  If  a  deviation  is  allowed  for  extraordinary  educational  expenses,  a 
monthly  average  of  these  expenses  shall  be  based  on  evidence  of  prior  or 
anticipated expenses and entered on the Worksheet in the deviation section.

Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.07(2)(d)(1)(i), (iii).  Similarly, special expenses 

(i) . . . incurred for child rearing which can be quantified may be added to the 
child support obligation as a deviation from the [presumptive child support 
order].  Such expenses include, but are not limited to, summer camp, music 
or  art  lessons,  travel,  school-sponsored  extra-curricular  activities,  such  as 
band,  clubs,  and  athletics,  and  other  activities  intended  to  enhance  the 
athletic, social or cultural development of a child, but that are not otherwise 
required  to  be  used  in  calculating  the  child  support  order  as  are  health 
insurance premiums and work-related childcare costs. 

***

- 59 -

(ii)  A  portion  of  the  basic  child  support  obligation  is  intended  to  cover 
average amounts of these special expenses incurred in the rearing of a child.  
When this category of expenses exceeds seven percent (7%) of the monthly 
[basic  child  support  obligation],  then  the  tribunal  shall  consider  additional 
amounts of support as a deviation to cover the full amount of these special 
expenses.

Tenn.  Comp.  R.  &  Regs.  1240-02-04-.07(2)(d)(2)(i),  (ii). Under  Tennessee  Code 
Annotated section 36-5-101(e)(1)(B) and the Guidelines, it was Wife’s burden to prove, by 
a preponderance of the evidence, that child support in excess of the presumptive amounts 
was reasonably necessary to provide for the needs of the Children.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-
5-101(e)(1)(B); Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.07(2)(g)(1).  Exhibits admitted into 
evidence  by  both  parties  supported  that  the  Children  had  extraordinary  educational 
expenses, i.e., their private school tuition and additional academic support for Easton, as 
well as special expenses, i.e., summer camps and various extra-curricular activities.  

Although the trial court denied Wife’s request for a $6,800.00 per month upward 
deviation  in  child  support (for  a  total  monthly  child  support  award  of  $10,000.00 per 
month),  the  trial  court  effectively  provided  for  this  additional  support  when  it  ordered 
Husband  to  pay  “the  reasonable  and  necessary  educational  expenses,  extracurricular 
activities  and  special  expenses  of  the  [C]hildren.”    A  list  of  these  expenses  and  the 
associated  cost  was  attached  as  an  exhibit  to  the trial  court’s findings  of  fact  and 
conclusions of law.  Turning to the exhibit, it shows that Father’s monthly expenses for the 
Children’s  educational  and  special  expenses  totaled  $9,810.82  per  month,  more  than 
Wife’s requested upward deviation.  These expenses included: (1) tuition for the Children’s 
schools (including meal plans); (2) fees for the Children’s extra-curricular activities, i.e., 
volleyball, choir, and guitar lessons; (3) costs associated with extra educational support for 
Easton; (4) costs associated with the Children’s camps; (5) medical and prescription costs; 
(6)  and  school  uniforms/clothing.    Because  the  trial  court  ordered  Husband  to  pay  the 
foregoing expenses, Wife will not be required to spend her resources on these expenses for 
the  Children.    Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  the  trial  court  did  not  err  when  it  denied 
Wife’s request for an upward deviation in child support.

Wife  also  appeals  the  duration  of  the  trial  court’s  child  support  order.    Under 

Tennessee Code Annotated section 34-1-102(b), 

[p]arents  shall  continue  to  be  responsible  for the  support  of  each  child  for 
whom they are responsible after the child reaches eighteen (18) years of age 
if the child is in high school. The duty of support shall continue until the child 
graduates from high school or the class of which the child is a member when 
the child attains eighteen (18) years of age graduates, whichever occurs first.

- 60 -

Tenn. Code Ann. § 34-1-102(b) (emphasis added).  Accordingly, if a child turns 18 and 
remains enrolled in high school, parents have a continuing obligation to support the child 
until either the child graduates or the class in which the child is a member when he or she 
turns 18 graduates, whichever occurs first.  In the permanent parenting plan, the trial court 
ordered:

[Husband] shall pay to [Wife] as regular child support the sum of $3,200[.00]
per  month  to  be  paid  on  the  first  day  of  each  month  until  Easton[’s]  18th
birthday  or  until  the  class  of  which  the  child  is  a  member  when  the  child 
attains 18 years of age graduates from high school, whichever occurs first.  
Then,  [Husband]’s  child  support  obligation  will  be  reduced  to  $2,100[.00]
until Saylor[’s] 18th birthday, until the class of which the child is a member 
when the child attains 18 years of age graduates from high school, whichever 
occurs first.

The effect of the trial court’s order results in Husband’s child support obligation for both 
Children terminating before they would graduate from high school, assuming they continue 
to be enrolled in school.  Because such order clearly contradicts the established law on this 
issue, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion when it determined the duration of 
Husband’s child support obligation.  Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the trial court’s 
support  order  concerning  the  duration  of  support  and  instruct  the  trial  court  to enter  a
support order that complies with Tennessee Code Annotated section 34-1-102(b).

b.  Retroactive Child Support27

We next turn to Wife’s argument that the trial court erred when it denied her request 
for retroactive child support.  Although the trial court addressed this issue together with 
the  issue  of  retroactive  temporary  spousal  support,  because  these  are  distinct  issues,  we 
address them separately.  

Concerning a retroactive temporary support award, the trial court found:

Wife’s contention that she did not have a temporary support hearing, her need 
for funds to repair the marital home, and that Husband has not paid temporary 
support are without merit. Husband has paid in excess of $400,000[.00] to 
Wife and/or for the benefit of her and the minor children during the pendency 
of  the  divorce. Additionally,  Wife  could have  concluded  her  temporary 
support  hearing  but  for  her  conduct.    Further,  Wife  will be  awarded  over 

                                           

27 Section  (E)(2)(b)  partially  addresses  Wife’s  eighth  issue:  “Did  the  trial  court  err  in  denying 
Wife’s request for temporary support during the pendency of the divorce?”  See Section (F)(2), infra, for 
further discussion of this issue.

- 61 -

$400,000[.00] of liquid assets, plus any income and support she may receive.  
Thus, Wife is not entitled to a retroactive temporary support award.

We  will  address  the  trial  court’s  finding  that  Wife  could  have  had  a  temporary  support 
hearing  “but  for  her  conduct,” infra.  However,  we  reiterate  that  parents  have  moral 
responsibilities and legal obligations to support their minor children.  See Richardson, 189 
S.W.3d at 724 (citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 34-1-102(a)); Wade, 115 S.W.3d at 920.  In short, 
Husband  was  required  to  support  the  Children  during  the  pendency  of  the  divorce 
regardless of whether Wife’s behavior prevented a temporary support hearing.  Because 
the trial court never entered an order concerning a temporary child support award, it should 
have considered whether to award Wife retroactive child support.  See Curry v. Curry, No. 
M2007-02446-COA-R3-CV, 2008 WL 4426895, at *12 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 18, 2008)
(citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 34-1-102(a); Smith v. Gore, 728 S.W.2d 738, 745, 751 (Tenn.
Ct. App. 1987)) (“In Tennessee, biological parents, even without a court order, have both 
a statutory and common law obligation to support their children if they have the ability to 
do so.”).

Turning to the Guidelines, 

(1)  Unless  the  rebuttal  provisions  of  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  §§  36-2-
311(a)(11)  or  36-5-101(e)  have  been  established  by  clear  and  convincing 
evidence provided to the tribunal, then, in cases in which initial support is 
being  set,  a  judgment  must  be  entered  to  include  an  amount  of  monthly 
support due up to the date that an order for current support is entered: 

***

(b) From the date: 

1. Of separation of the parties in a divorce or in an annulment.

Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.06(1) (emphasis added).  However, a trial court may 
deviate  from  the  “presumption  that  a  judgment  for  retroactive  support  shall  be  awarded 
back to . . . the date of the separation of the parties[.]”  Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-
04-.06(2)).  Such deviation shall be supported by written findings in the trial court’s order 
that include:

(a) The reasons the tribunal, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated §§ 36-
2-311(a)(11)(A)  or  36-5-101(e)(1)(C),  deviated  from  the  presumptive 
amount  of  child  support  that  would  have  been  paid  pursuant  to  the
Guidelines; and 

(b)  The  amount  of  child  support  that  would  have  been  required  under  the 
- 62 -

Guidelines if the presumptive amount had not been rebutted; and 

(c) A written finding by the tribunal that states how, in its determination, 

1.  Application  of  the  Guidelines  would  be  unjust  or 
inappropriate in the particular case before the tribunal; and 

2. The best interests of the child or children who are subject to 
the support award determination are served by deviation from 
the presumptive guideline amount.

Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.06(2) (emphases added); see also Tenn. Code Ann. 
§ 36-5-101(e)(1)(F).28  

Turning  to  the  record,  the  trial  court  did  not enter  a  judgment  for  an  amount  of 
monthly child support due from the date of separation through the date the child support 
order was entered.  See Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.06(1).  The trial court also 
did  not make  any  of  the  required  findings  concerning  why  a  retroactive  child  support
judgment should not have been entered.  See Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.06(2).  
Although the record shows that the Children had extraordinary and special expenses that 
Husband  paid  during  the  pendency  of  the  divorce,  discussed,  supra,  the  trial  court’s 
combination  of  all  of  Wife’s  pendente  lite  support  into  one  number,  i.e.,  “in  excess  of 
$400,000[.00],”  leaves  this  Court  to  question what  portion  of  that  amount  was  for  child 
support.  Without a finding of the presumptive monthly support obligation and a finding 
concerning the amount of support Husband paid for the Children during the pendency of 
the divorce, this Court cannot determine whether the trial court abused its discretion when 
it denied Wife’s request for retroactive child support.  Similarly, we are unable to determine 
whether the trial court found that a deviation from the presumptive support amount was 
necessary  and  in  the  Children’s  best  interests  because it  did  not  provide  any  written 
findings.  Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-02-04-.06(2); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-
101(e)(1)(F); Knipper v. Enfinger, No. W2019-02130-COA-R3-JV, 2020 WL 5204227, 
at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2020).29  

In  the  absence  of  appropriate  findings  of  fact,  we  vacate  the  trial  court’s  order 

                                           

28 Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  36-2-311(a)(11)(A)  concerns  retroactive  support  in  a 
parentage action, and is inapplicable to this case.  Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-101(e)(1)(C) 
concerns retroactive support awards under the Guidelines “in cases where the parents of the minor child are 
separated or divorced, but where the court has not yet entered an order of child support[.]”  Tenn. Code 
Ann.  §  36-5-101(e)(1)(C).    However,  we  note  that  the  factors  that  would  allow  for  deviation  under 
Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-101(e)(1)(C), i.e., abandonment, are inapplicable here.  

29  In addition to the statutory requirements, Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 52.01 requires trial 
courts, in non-jury actions, to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law in its final orders.  See 
Butler v. Pitts, No. W2016-01674-COA-R3-CV, 2017 WL 3432688, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 10, 2017).
- 63 -

concerning retroactive child support and remand the matter to the trial court for entry of an 
order containing the necessary findings.  The trial court is not precluded from reopening 
proof  on this  issue. See Vance v. Vance,  No.  M2017-00622-COA-R3-CV,  2018  WL 
1363323, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 16, 2018); Williams v. Williams, No. W2016-01602-
COA-R3-CV,  2017  WL  3535322,  at  *6  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Aug.  17,  2017).   In  making  its 
judgment, the trial court is instructed to follow the Guidelines, which provide the proper 
procedure  for  calculating a  retroactive  support  amount  and  mandate  that  the  support 
amount “shall be calculated . . . using the Guidelines in effect at the time of the hearing on
retroactive  support.”    Tenn.  Comp.  R.  &  Regs.  1240-02-04-.06(3) (emphasis  added).  
Accordingly,  if  the  trial  court  conducts  an  additional  hearing  concerning  Husband’s 
retroactive child support obligation, it is instructed to use the Guidelines in effect at that 
time.  Otherwise, the trial court should use the Guidelines in effect during the trial.

F.  Issues Concerning Wife’s Support

We now turn to the issues concerning support for Wife.  Tennessee Code Annotated 
section 36-5-121(a) provides that, in any action for divorce, a “court may award alimony 
to be paid by one spouse to or for the benefit of the other[.]”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-
121(a).  A court may also, in its discretion, order one spouse to pay for the support and 
maintenance  of  the  other  spouse  while  a  divorce  is  pending.    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-5-
121(b).  With the foregoing in mind, we turn to the issue of Wife’s transitional alimony 
award.

1.  Transitional Alimony Award30

The  Tennessee  General  Assembly  has  recognized  “that  the  contributions  to  the 
marriage  as  homemaker  or  parent  are  of  equal  dignity  and  importance  as  economic 
contributions to the marriage.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(c)(2).  Further, the General 
Assembly has acknowledged that there is often an economic detriment to the spouse who 
“focuses on nurturing the personal side of the marriage, including the care and nurturing 
of  the  children,”  because  such  spouse  “subordinated  [their]  own  personal  career  for  the 
benefit of the marriage.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(c)(1).  Accordingly, where 

one  (1)  spouse  suffers  economic  detriment  for  the  benefit  of  the  marriage, 
the  general  assembly  finds  that  the  economically  disadvantaged  spouse’s 
standard of living after the divorce should be reasonably comparable to the
standard of living enjoyed during the marriage or to the post-divorce standard 
of living expected to be available to the other spouse, considering the relevant 
statutory factors and the equities between the parties.

                                           

and duration of the alimony award to Wife?”

30 This section addresses Wife’s fifth issue: “Did the trial court err in determining the type, amount, 

- 64 -

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(c)(2).  

“Once the trial court has found a party to be economically disadvantaged relative to 
his  or  her  spouse,  it  must  determine  the  nature,  amount,  length  of  term,  and  manner  of 
payment  of  the  award.”    Perry  v.  Perry,  114  S.W.3d  465,  467  (Tenn.  2003).    Under
Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-121(d)(1), “[t]he court may award rehabilitative 
alimony,  alimony  in  futuro,  also  known  as  periodic  alimony,  transitional  alimony,  or 
alimony in solido . . . .”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(1).  The General Assembly has 
expressed a preference for rehabilitative alimony to allow “a spouse, who is economically 
disadvantaged  relative  to  the  other  spouse,  [to]  be  rehabilitated,  whenever  possible[.]”  
Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(2).  For a spouse to be rehabilitated, they must 

achieve, with reasonable effort, an earning capacity that will permit the
economically disadvantaged spouse’s standard of living after the divorce to
be reasonably comparable to the standard of living enjoyed during the
marriage, or to the post-divorce standard of living expected to be available
to the other spouse, considering the relevant statutory factors and the equities 
between the parties.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(2); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(e)(1).  However, 
courts may award alimony in futuro where rehabilitation is not feasible.  Tenn. Code Ann. 
§ 36-5-121(d)(4), (f)(1).  Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-121(f)(1) provides that 
alimony in futuro

is a payment of support and maintenance on a long term basis or until death 
or remarriage of the recipient.  Such alimony may be awarded when the court 
finds that there is relative economic disadvantage and that rehabilitation is 
not  feasible,  meaning  that the  disadvantaged  spouse  is  unable  to  achieve, 
with  reasonable  effort,  an  earning  capacity  that  will  permit  the  spouse’s 
standard  of  living  after  the  divorce  to  be  reasonably  comparable  to  the 
standard  of  living  enjoyed  during  the  marriage,  or  to  the  post-divorce 
standard of living expected to be available to the other spouse, considering 
the relevant statutory factors and the equities between the parties.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(f)(1); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(4).  Courts 
may  also  award  transitional  alimony  “when  the  court  finds  that  rehabilitation  is  not 
necessary,  but  the  economically  disadvantaged spouse  needs  assistance  to  adjust  to  the 
economic consequences of a divorce[.]”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(4); see also Tenn.
Code  Ann.  §  36-5-121(g)(1).    Finally,  courts  may  award  alimony  in  solido,  also  called 
“lump sum alimony,” which “is a form of long-term support, the total amount of which is 
calculable  on  the  date  the  decree  is  entered,  but  which  is  not  designated  as  transitional 
alimony.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(h)(1).  “Alimony in solido may be awarded in lieu 
of  or  in  addition  to  any  other  alimony  award,  in  order  to  provide  support  .  .  .  where 
- 65 -

appropriate.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(5).  

“[I]n determining the nature, amount, length of term, and manner of payment,” trial 
courts are required to consider all relevant factors set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated 
Section  36-5-121(i),  discussed further,  infra.31    All relevant  statutory  factors  are  to  be 
considered by the trial court, but “the two that are considered the most important are the 
disadvantaged  spouse’s  need  and  the  obligor  spouse’s  ability  to  pay.”    Gonsewski  v. 
Gonsewski, 350 S.W.3d 99, 110 (Tenn. 2011) (quoting Riggs v. Riggs, 250 S.W.3d 453, 
457  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2007)).    Trial  courts  have  broad  discretion  in  awarding  spousal 
support,  Bratton  v.  Bratton,  136  S.W.3d  595,  605  (Tenn.  2004),  and  this  Court  is 

                                           

31  The statutory factors for courts to consider are:

(1) The relative earning capacity, obligations, needs, and financial resources of each party, 
including income from pension, profit sharing or retirement plans and all other sources;

(2) The relative education and training of each party, the ability and opportunity of each 
party to secure such education and training, and the necessity of a party to secure further 
education and training to improve such party’s earnings capacity to a reasonable level;

(3) The duration of the marriage;

appropriate to do so; and

“disinclined to second-guess a trial judge’s spousal support decision” absent a trial court’s 
abuse of discretion.  Kinard v. Kinard, 986 S.W.2d 220, 234 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).  As 
thoroughly discussed above, a trial court abuses its discretion when it applies the incorrect 
legal standard and reaches a decision that is clearly unreasonable.  Bogan v. Bogan, 60 
S.W.3d  721,  733  (Tenn.  2001)  (citing  Overstreet  v.  Shoney’s,  Inc.,  4  S.W.3d  694,  709 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 1999)).

Although  Wife  did  not  plead for alimony  in  her  initial  complaint  or  amended 
complaint, the trial court allowed her to amend her complaint during trial to add a request 
for  alimony.    Turning  to  the  final  decree,  the  trial  court  awarded  Wife  non-modifiable 
transitional  alimony  in  the  sum  of  $15,810.50  per  month  for  sixty-six  (66)  months, 
beginning July 31, 2019 until December 31, 2024, for a total of $1,043,493.00.  The trial 
court  also  ordered  Husband  to:  (1)  provide  Wife’s  COBRA  coverage  by  paying  her 
COBRA premiums for 15 months after entry of the final decree; and (2) pay the equivalent 
amount  of  money  Husband  was  paying  for  Wife’s  COBRA  premiums  to  Wife  for  the 
following 21 months.  The foregoing awards were designated as alimony in solido.32  Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(5).  

In determining the nature, amount, and term of Wife’s alimony award, the trial court 
appropriately considered each factor in Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-121(i) and 
made specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.  From her briefing, it appears that 
Wife’s issues lie with the trial court’s findings and conclusions regarding the first and ninth 
factors.    The  first  factor  asks  courts  to  consider  the  “[t]he  relative  earning  capacity, 
obligations, needs, and financial resources of each party, including income from pension, 
profit sharing or retirement plans and all other sources.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i)(1).  
Concerning income,  the  trial  court  “did  not  include  any  income  for  Wife,  despite  it[s]
finding that nothing prohibit[ed] Wife from working.”  However, the trial court found that 
Wife had an earning capacity of $182,000.00 per year and required no additional education, 
training, or other rehabilitation to reach this income.  

On  appeal,  Wife  argues  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  its  findings  concerning  her 
earning capacity.  First, Wife argues that the evidence does not support that Wife had an 
earning capacity of $182,000.00.  Wife’s support for this argument is two-fold.  First, Wife 
argues that  she  never  received  an  income  during  her  tenure  as  W&A,  Inc.’s  Global 
Communications  Director and, second,  that  the  trial  court  contradicted  itself  when  it 
imputed no income to Wife for child support purposes but found that Wife was capable of 
earning  $182,000.00.    As  to  the  second  argument,  concerning  both  child  support  and 
alimony, the trial court found that Wife had no income.  However, for alimony purposes, 
the trial court found that Wife had an earning capacity, i.e., was capable of earning based 
on her employment history, volunteer history, and education, of $182,000.00.  We do not 
conclude that such finding was error.  Wife presented no evidence concerning what income 

                                           

32  Wife does not specifically appeal this alimony in solido award.

- 67 -

she was capable of earning.  However, Husband’s vocational expert, Dr. Strauser, testified 
that Wife  had  the  capacity  to  obtain  and  maintain  employment  in  public  relations, 
fundraising  management,  marketing  management,  and  as  a  vice  president  of  operations, 
and that any of these positions would allow for a yearly income between $142,260.00 and 
$182,138.00.  In the absence of any evidence to contradict Dr. Strauser’s testimony, it was 
not error for the trial court to find that Wife had an earning capacity of $182,000.00.  As to 
Wife’s first argument, the fact that Wife did not earn income during the marriage does not,
ipso facto, establish that Wife is incapable of securing employment or a higher income in 
the future.  The evidence shows, and the trial court found, that Wife has substantial contacts
in  Memphis,  and  is  “very  intelligent,  capable,  and  qualified  to  do  very  well  in  the 
professional world if she applies herself.”  Indeed, aside from her work with W&A, Inc., 
Wife has served on numerous non-profit boards in the Memphis area and has substantial 
business contacts.

Turning  to  Husband’s  earning  capacity,  the  trial  court  found  that  it  was 
$1,000,000.00 per  year but  noted  that,  since  2016,  Husband  had not  earned  more  than 
$758,408.00 in income from employment.  The trial court did not consider any assets in 
trust when determining Husband’s income.  On appeal, Wife asserts, without any citation 
to  the  record,  that  Husband’s  average  earnings  prior  to  the  divorce  filing  were 
$3,500,000.00.33  The record shows that Husband’s average wages earned from 2013-2017 
were  $1,281,652.00.    The  record  also  supports  the  trial  court’s  finding  that  Husband’s 
wages in 2016 and 2017 were $734,506.00 and $758,408.00, respectively.  Accordingly, 
the evidence does not preponderate against the trial court’s finding that Husband had an 
earning capacity of $1,000,000.00 at the time of divorce.  Wife also argues that the trial 
court  erred  when  it  “failed  to  consider  Husband’s  access  to  and  control  of  over 
$8,000,000.00 in trust assets” in determining his income from “all other sources.”  Again, 
Wife  fails  to  provide  any  citation  to  the  record  to  show  the  amount  of trust  assets.    As 
discussed at length, supra, Wife failed to make an offer of proof concerning trust assets, 
and the record does not support Wife’s allegation that Husband had access to and control 
of over $8,000,000.00 in trust assets.  Given the foregoing, we conclude that the evidence 
supports the trial court’s findings concerning the parties’ earning capacities.

The  first  factor  also  requires  courts  to  consider  the  parties’  respective  needs.    At 
trial, Wife sought an alimony award of $64,000.00 per month.  The trial court found that 

                                           

33 We deduce that Wife calculated this figure by using Husband’s previous tax returns.  We note 
that  Husband’s  2016  tax  return  showed  a  capital  gain  of  over  $8,000,000.    Husband  explained  in  his 
testimony that the gain was the result of the Focus transaction, but that such gain belonged to the DSW 
Trust.  Although the DSW Trust was a grantor trust, because Husband’s father (the grantor of the trust) had 
recently  died,  Husband  became  liable  for  the  taxes  resulting  from  the  capital  gain  that  the  DSW  Trust 
experienced.  Husband testified that he paid the taxes on the capital gain with reimbursement from the trust.  
Based on this testimony, the trial court found that Husband did not make $8,000,000 in 2016 and declined 
to use that number to calculate his earning capacity.  The evidence in the record supports the trial court’s 
findings.  

- 68 -

Wife  failed  to  provide  sufficient  evidence  to  substantiate  her  expenses  and  that  her 
expenses  were  rebutted  by  Husband’s  expert,  Mr.  Vance.    Accordingly,  the  trial  court 
adjusted  Wife’s  monthly  expenses  based  on  the  evidence  and  found  that  Wife’s  need, 
including  the  Children  and  pet  expenses,  totaled  $19,010.50  per  month.    The  trial  court 
then subtracted the child support award from Wife’s total expenses to arrive at an alimony 
award  of  $15,810.50.    Although  Wife  takes issue  with  the  trial  court’s  reduction  of  her 
expenses,  she  provides  no  argument  or  citation  to  the  record  concerning  how  such 
reduction was an error.  After adjusting Husband’s monthly expenses, the trial court found 
his need, including the Children and pet expenses, to be $28,729.44 per month.  Wife does 
not  challenge  this  finding.    On  this  Court’s  review,  the  record  supports  the  trial  court’s 
calculation of the parties’ respective needs.  

The  ninth  factor  is  the  “standard  of  living  of  the  parties  established  during  the 
marriage[.]”    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-5-121(i)(9).    Concerning  this  factor,  the  trial  court 
found that the parties enjoyed a high standard of living during the marriage, wherein they 
did not save, but “spent the money they earned and lived above their  means.”  The trial 
court found that the parties often  spent considerable money traveling with the  Children, 
and that the parties’ excessive spending was not limited to the time during the marriage.  
The trial court found that, throughout the divorce proceedings, “the parties continued to 
live  above  their  means  and  the  marital  estate  [was]  all  but  depleted.”    Considering  her 
standard of living after the divorce, the trial court found that Wife would receive the marital 
residence and be afforded “a comparable standard of living, except for travel, as the parties 
cannot continue to travel around the world and spend excessive amounts as they did during 
their marriage.”  Similarly, the trial court found that Husband’s monthly expenses would 
allow him to enjoy a standard of living comparable to that which he enjoyed during the 
marriage.  Turning to the record, the evidence supports the trial court’s findings that the 
parties  enjoyed  a  high  standard  of  living  during  the  marriage,  and  that  they  lived  above 
their means, saved very little, and that the marital estate was relatively small.  Further, it is 
clear that the marital estate was significantly depleted by the divorce process.  The record 
also shows that the parties should be able to live comfortably with the amounts allocated 
toward their monthly expenses.

Although Wife did not raise arguments concerning the remaining statutory factors, 
we briefly review them against the trial court’s findings.  Concerning the education and 
training of the parties, the trial court found that Wife has a bachelor’s degree in business 
and public relations and a master’s degree in communication.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-
121(i)(2).  The trial court further found that Wife had seventeen years of experience in the 
business community through her work as W&A, Inc.’s Global Communications Director, 
through  her  retail  business,34 through  her  volunteering  on  various  non-profit  boards  and 
through  fundraising  efforts  for  such  non-profits.    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-5-121(i)(2).  

                                           

34  The record shows that the parties owned, but Wife operated, a retail clothing business for a few 

years during the marriage called Blu Champagne. 

- 69 -

Concerning Husband’s education and training, the trial court found that he had a bachelor’s 
degree  and  a  master’s  degree  in  business  administration.    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-5-
121(i)(2).    The  trial  court  concluded  that  neither  party  required  additional  education  or 
training to improve his or her earning capacity.  On this Court’s review, the record supports 
the above findings.

Regarding  the  third  and  fourth  factors,  the  trial  court  found  that  the  parties  were 
married seventeen years, that Husband was 46 years old, Wife was 45 years old, and neither 
party suffered from mental conditions.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i)(3), (4).  Concerning 
the  physical  condition  of  each  party,  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-5-121(i)(5),  the  trial  court 
found that Husband was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, but that it was managed.  The 
trial  court  further  found  that  “Wife’s  testimony  regarding  her  physical  condition  is  not 
substantiated by medical proof nor credible,” and that her testimony was inconsistent with 
her answers to Husband’s first set of interrogatories, wherein Wife represented that she had 
no medical conditions.  Thus, the trial court found that both parties were “physically and 
mentally  fit  to  obtain  and  maintain  gainful  and  competitive  employment.”    Tenn.  Code 
Ann. § 36-5-121(i)(5).  Concerning the sixth factor, the trial court found that the Children 
were teenagers and would not hinder Wife’s ability to work outside of the home during the 
remaining years of the Children’s minority.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i)(6).  The trial 
court found that the parties had very limited separate property. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-
121(i)(7).  The record supports these findings.

Concerning the division of the marital property, the trial court deemed the division 
equitable  where Wife  was  awarded  over  $400,000.00  in  cash-equivalent  assets.    Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i)(8).  The trial court also found that the parties made tangible and 
intangible  contributions  to  the  marriage  and  to  each  other.    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-5-
121(i)(10).    Wife  was  a  homemaker  who  also  worked  for  W&A,  Inc.  as  Global 
Communications  Director.    Additionally,  Wife  represented  Husband  and  W&A,  Inc. 
through her numerous volunteer efforts.  Husband supported the family financially and also 
supported Wife’s business endeavors as well as her position within W&A, Inc.  Regarding 
the  eleventh  factor,  the  trial  court  found  that  both  parties  were  guilty  of  inappropriate 
marital conduct and both parties were at fault for the demise of the marriage.  Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 36-5-121(i)(11).  Finally, the trial court considered that Wife would be receiving 
alimony  unencumbered  by  taxes,  and  that  social  security  and  Medicare  tax  would  be 
withheld from Husband’s income.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i)(12).  From our review, 
the record supports these findings.

Based on the foregoing, the trial court found that Wife was a disadvantaged spouse 
who required  “financial  assistance  to  ‘bridge  the  gap’  from  the  time  of  the  divorce  to  a 
certain time in the future and to soften the ‘economic blow’ of divorce.”  However, it also 
found that Wife had “the education, skills, and experience warranting an earning capacity 
of  $182,000[.00] per  year[,]  thus,  rehabilitation  [was] not  necessary.”    Accordingly,  the 
trial court concluded that an alimony award of $15,810.50 for 66 months was appropriate 
- 70 -

given  “Wife[’s]  need  and  Husband[’s]  ability  to  pay”  and  was  “necessary  for  Wife’s 
support and maintenance to adjust to the economic consequences of this divorce.”  

Although  it  is  somewhat  unclear,  it  appears  from  her  appellate  brief  that  Wife’s 
argument on  appeal is  that she  cannot be  rehabilitated,  thus,  she  maintains  that  the  trial 
court erred in not awarding her long-term support.  We recall that alimony in futuro may 
be awarded when rehabilitation is not feasible.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(4), (f)(1).  
Wife seems  to  argue  that  rehabilitation  is  not feasible because  she  will  never  earn  the 
income  necessary  to  enjoy:  (1)  the  standard  of  living  the  parties’  enjoyed  during  the 
marriage; and (2) the standard of living that Husband will enjoy post-divorce due to his 
higher earning capacity.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(2); see also Tenn. Code Ann. 
§ 36-5-121(e)(1).  Wife’s argument is contrary to the trial court’s findings.  

As discussed above, after adjusting Wife’s monthly expenses based on the evidence 
in the record, the trial court found Wife’s individual need and/or standard of living to be 
around  $15,810.00.    Also  discussed  above,  Wife’s  appellate  brief fails  to  cite  to  any 
evidence  showing that  this  finding,  i.e.,  that  Wife’s  need  and/or  standard  of  living  was 
higher  than  $15,810.00, was  incorrect.35    As  discussed,  supra,  the  trial  court  found  that 
Wife  had  an  earning  capacity  of  $182,000.00,  the  gross  monthly  income  from which  is 
$15,167.00.  Assuming a slightly lower net monthly income, such income would provide 
Wife with a “reasonably comparable standard of living” to that which she enjoyed during 
the marriage.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(2); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-
121(e)(1).    Furthermore,  Wife  can  reach  this  earning  capacity  without  any  additional 
education or training.  Indeed, Wife has two advanced degrees and has been active in the 
Memphis  business  community throughout the  entire  marriage.    Based  on  the  foregoing 
facts, the evidence does not preponderate against the trial court’s finding that Wife did not 
need to be rehabilitated.  Lastly, it is important to recognize that the trial court found that 
Husband was able to pay Wife $15,810.00 per month in alimony.  With an earning capacity 
of $1,000,000.00, the trial court calculated Husband’s net monthly income after taxes as 
$54,166.00.  With this net monthly income, Husband can afford to pay both his expenses 
and  the  Children’s  extra  expenses  (totaling  $28,729.44),  $3,200.00 per  month  in  child 
support,  and  $15,810.50.00 in  alimony.    However,  Husband  cannot  afford  to  pay  Wife
$64,000.00 per month in alimony as this amount, coupled with Husband’s expenses, would 
be higher than Husband’s net monthly income.  

We  are  mindful  that  divorcing  couples  are  often  forced  into  a  lower  standard  of 
living after divorce because they cannot afford the same standard of living with double the 
households and double the expenses.  Indeed, “two persons living separately incur more 

                                           

35  As support for her argument that she had a higher standard of living during the marriage, Wife 
cites to the trial court’s comment, not finding, that “these parties have  enjoyed  over a million dollars in 
income  in  one  year.”    Such  comment  from  the  trial  court  during  the  trial  hardly  amounts  to  evidence 
demonstrating that the trial court’s findings concerning Wife’s need were incorrect.

expenses than two persons living together[,] [t]hus, in most divorce cases[,] it is unlikely 
that both parties will be able to maintain their pre-divorce lifestyle once the proceedings 
are concluded.”  Gonsewski, 350 S.W.3d at 113 (quoting Kinard, 986 S.W.2d at 234); see 
also  Robertson  v.  Robertson,  76  S.W.3d  337,  340  (Tenn.  2002) (“The  parties’  incomes 
and  assets  will  not  always  be  sufficient  for  them  to  achieve  the  same  standard  of  living 
after divorce that they enjoyed during the marriage.”).  For this reason, the marital standard 
of  living  is  simply  one  of  many  factors  a  court  considers  when  awarding  alimony.  
Robertson, 76 S.W.3d at 340; see Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i)(9).  From the record, we 
conclude that the parties ostensibly will be able to reasonably maintain their pre-divorce 
standards of living, with the exception of the extensive travel enjoyed during the marriage.  
In view of the alimony factors, the record does not preponderate against the trial court’s 
factual findings or its award of $15,810.00 per month in transitional alimony to Wife for 
66 months.  Because the trial court’s award does not constitute an abuse of discretion, we 
affirm the transitional alimony award.

2.  Retroactive Temporary Support36

Wife contends  that  the  trial  court  erred  when  it  denied  her  requests  for  alimony, 
attorney’s fees, and/or expert fees during the pendency of the divorce.  Under Tennessee 
Code Annotated section 36-5-121(b), a

court  may, in  its  discretion,  at  any  time  pending  the  final  hearing,  upon 
motion and after notice and hearing, make any order . . . to compel a spouse 
to  pay  any  sums  necessary  for  the  support  and  maintenance  of  the  other 
spouse, to enable such spouse to prosecute or defend the suit of the parties 
and to make other orders as it deems appropriate.

Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-5-121(b) (emphasis  added).    As discussed  above, the  trial  court 
denied Wife’s request for a temporary retroactive support award because: (1) Husband paid 
“in excess of $400,000[.00] to Wife and/or for the benefit of her and the minor [C]hildren 
during the pendency of the divorce;” (2) Wife could have concluded her temporary support 
hearing, but for her conduct; and (3) Wife was awarded over $400,000.00 in liquid assets 
from the marital estate.  We review a trial court’s decision concerning retroactive support 
under an abuse of discretion standard.

On appeal, Wife’s entire argument concerning this issue is that: (1) she consistently 
requested temporary support during the proceedings; (2) a temporary support hearing was 
conducted over several days but was never completed; and (3) the trial court “refused to 
permit Wife to complete the last day of the[] temporary support hearing[].”  Accordingly, 
Wife  argues  that  the  trial  court  abused  its  discretion  when  it  denied  her  request  for 

                                           

further discussion.

36 This section addresses the remainder of Wife’s eighth issue.  See Section (E)(2)(b), supra, for 

- 72 -

retroactive support.

A brief review of the procedural history is helpful here:

 On August 3, 2017, Wife withdrew $125,000.00 from the parties’ joint account.
 On August 4, 2017, Wife filed her initial complaint for divorce and requested “that 
she  be  awarded  child  support  both  pendente  lite and  permanent.”    As  discussed 
above, Wife did not plead for alimony.  

 On September 5, 2017, Wife filed her amended complaint for divorce and requested 
attorney’s fees and expenses but, again, did not specifically plead for alimony.
 On  September  13,  2017,  Wife  filed  her  first  motion,  requesting pendente  lite
alimony,  child  support,  and  attorney’s  fees.    She  set  the  motion  for  a  hearing  on 
October 6, 2017.  By email dated September 25, 2017, a representative from Wife’s 
counsel’s office asked the trial court to strike the October 6, 2017 setting.

 On November 13, 2017, Wife filed her second motion, again seeking pendente lite
alimony,  child  support,  and  attorney’s  fees.    She  set  the  motion  for  a  hearing  on 
November 20, 2017.  At some point, this hearing was reset for February 1, 2018.  
On January 22, 2018, a representative from Wife’s counsel’s office emailed the trial 
court asking to strike the February 1, 2018 date and indicating that the matter would 
be reset at a later time.

 On  February  16,  2018,  Wife filed  her  third  pendente  lite motion,  requesting 
alimony,  child  support,  attorney’s  fees,  and  expert  fees.    She  set  this  motion  for 
hearing on March 15, 2018.  It does not appear that the trial court heard this motion 
on March 15, 2018.

 On February 22, 2018, Wife filed her motion for suit expenses wherein she alleged
that  Husband  had  provided  her  with only $1,500.00 since  August  2017,  and  she 
asked  that  the  trial  court  order  Husband  to  provide  her  $135,000.00 towards  her 
attorney’s fees and other suit expenses. 

 On  April  17,  2018,  Wife  filed  her  fourth  pendente  lite motion, seeking  alimony, 
child support, and attorney’s fees.  She set this motion for a hearing on June 5, 2018.  
It does not appear that the trial court heard this motion on June 5, 2018.

 On June 21, 2018, the first trial judge entered an order referring Wife’s motion for 
suit expenses, motion for mediation fees, and motion for pendente lite support to the 
divorce referee.  

 On July 28, 2018, the temporary support hearing began before the divorce referee
and the hearing continued on  September 17, 2018, October 9, 2018, and October 
17, 2018.

The record shows that the parties did not complete the temporary support hearing 
on October 17, 2018.  On February 8, 2019, in a hearing on an unrelated matter, counsel 
for  the  parties  discussed  scheduling  issues  hindering  the  conclusion  of the  temporary 
support hearing.  Wife alleged that Husband was obstructing the conclusion of the hearing.  
- 73 -

The trial court acknowledged that Wife “need[ed] to have a hearing,” and ordered Husband 
to make himself available mid-February to conclude the temporary support hearing.  The 
record shows that the parties were set to return to the divorce referee on February 13 and 
14, 2019.  

As discussed at length, supra, also on February 8, 2019, Wife retrieved her devices 
from  her  previous  counsel’s  office.    This  action resulted  in  Wife’s  previous  counsel
withdrawing from representation on February 11, 2019, two days before the parties were 
set to return to the divorce referee to conclude the temporary support hearing.  Although 
Wife alleged that she had hired new counsel and was retrieving her devices to give to her 
new counsel, Wife made the decision to access her devices and fire her attorney mere days 
before the parties were set to conclude the temporary support hearing.  Thus, the record 
shows  that  the  reason  the  parties  did  not  conclude  the  temporary  support  hearing  in 
February 2019 was, as the trial court found, due to Wife’s conduct.

On  April  18,  2019,  Wife  filed  a  motion  to  compel  and/or  for  attorney’s  fees  and 
temporary support alleging that Husband was intentionally obstructing the conclusion of 
the  temporary  support  hearing.    In  this  motion,  Wife  averred  that  she  set  the  temporary 
support  hearing  for  May  10,  2019,  and  asked  the  trial  court  to  compel  Husband’s 
attendance  at  the  hearing.    In  the  alternative,  Wife  asked  the  trial  court  to  award  her 
$200,000.00 towards  her  attorney’s  fees  and suit  expenses.    On  May  10,  2019,  the  trial 
court  heard  Wife’s  motion.    By  order  entered  May  22,  2019,  the  trial  court  denied  the 
motion in part and granted it in part, to-wit:

1.  Wife’s  request  to  conclude  the  temporary  support  hearing  before  the 
Divorce Referee is denied.  The parties’ resources are better used to prepare 
for the final trial.  The final trial is less than a month away; and thus, having 
the parties and the [c]ourt spend time and resources on a temporary support 
hearing before the Divorce Referee at this point would be imprudent; 

2.  Wife’s  request  for  attorney’s  fees  is  granted  in  part.    Based  on 
representations  made  by  counsel  for  the  parties  Wife  has  received 
approximately $315,000[.00] in marital assets since the filing of the divorce; 
whereas  Husband  has  paid  $379,900[.00],  to  his  attorney for  fees  and  for 
lawsuit expenses; resulting in a difference of $64,000[.00]. The most recent 
Rule 14(C) Affidavit filed by Husband reflects a SunTrust Checking Account 
having a balance of $89,000[.00].  Thus, equalizing between the parties the 
funds Husband used to pay his attorney would be equitable;

3.  As  such,  the  [c]ourt  hereby  awards  a  judgment  in  the  amount  of 
$64,000[.00] in favor of Wife. . . .  Wife should use said award to pay her 
lawyers  and  any  other  expenses  that  she  deems  appropriate  to  prepare  her 
case for trial; 

- 74 -

4.  Husband  shall  pay  the  sum  of  $64,000[.00] to  Wife’s  counsel  by 
Wednesday, May 22, 2019.

Although  Wife  provides  no  citation  to  the  record  to  support  her  allegation,  we 
presume  that  Wife’s  appellate  argument  that  the  trial  court  “refused  to  permit  Wife  to 
complete the last day of the[] temporary support hearings” concerns the foregoing order.  
Indeed, Wife wholly fails to cite to the trial court’s order on her motion to compel and/or 
for  attorney’s  fees  and  temporary  support  in this  portion  of her  appellate  brief.   On  our 
review of the trial court’s order and the record, we conclude that it was not error for the 
trial court to deny Wife’s request to conclude the temporary support hearing nineteen days 
before trial was scheduled to begin.  Wife had ample opportunity to conclude the temporary 
support hearing before this time, but her own decisions led to its postponement.  We agree 
with  the  trial  court  that,  by  the  time  Wife  requested  another  setting  for  the  temporary 
support hearing, the parties’ time and resources were better spent in preparation for trial.  
Furthermore, as the trial court found in the foregoing order, Wife received approximately 
$315,000.00 in marital assets during the divorce to use towards litigation expenses, and she 
received another $64,000.00 in marital funds a few days before trial began.  According to 
the record, this amount was in addition to the $400,000.00 Wife received in support during 
the litigation.  As such, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred when it denied Wife’s 
request  to complete  the  temporary  support  hearing  or  when  it  denied  Wife’s  request  for 
retroactive support in the form of alimony and/or attorney’s fees and expenses.

G.  Wife’s Attorney’s Fees

Wife’s final issues concern the attorney’s fees she incurred at trial and on appeal.  

We consider each in turn.

1.  At Trial37

As the Tennessee Supreme Court has explained,

in 

alimony 

solido. 
in  solido may 

[i]t  is  well-settled  that  an  award  of  attorney’s  fees  in  a  divorce  case 
See Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-
constitutes 
121(h)(1) (“alimony 
fees,  where 
appropriate”); Herrera v. Herrera,  944  S.W.2d  379,  390  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
1996).  .  .  .    As  with  any  alimony  award,  in  deciding  whether  to  award 
attorney’s fees as alimony in solido, the trial court should consider the factors 
enumerated  in Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-121(i).    A  spouse 
with adequate property and income is not entitled to an award of alimony to 

 
include  attorney 

                                           

attorney fees and suit expenses?”

37 This  section  addresses  Wife’s  tenth  issue:  “Did  the  trial  court  err  in  not  awarding  Wife  her 

- 75 -

pay attorney’s fees and expenses.  Umstot v. Umstot, 968 S.W.2d 819, 824 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 1997).  Such awards are appropriate only when the spouse 
seeking  them  lacks  sufficient  funds  to  pay  his  or  her  own  legal 
expenses, see Houghland v. Houghland,  844  S.W.2d  619,  623  (Tenn.  Ct. 
App. 1992), or the spouse would be required to deplete his or her resources 
in order to pay them, see Harwell v. Harwell, 612 S.W.2d 182, 185 (Tenn. 
Ct.  App.  1980).  Thus,  where  the  spouse  seeking  such  an  award  has 
demonstrated  that  he  or  she  is  financially  unable  to  procure  counsel,  and 
where the other spouse has the ability to pay, the court may properly grant 
an award of attorney’s fees as alimony. See id. at 185.

Gonsewski, 350 S.W.3d at 113. 

Turning to the final decree, the trial court declined to award Wife attorney’s fees 
incurred at trial.  The trial court noted that “the amount of attorney’s fees paid [during the 
litigation] were  equalized  from  the  marital  estate  and  Husband’s  earnings  per  the  [trial 
court]’s order.”  From the trial court’s findings of facts and conclusions of law, it is clear 
that the trial court also declined to award Wife additional attorney’s fees because “the way 
Wife prosecuted her divorce was irresponsible and wasteful.”  Specifically, the trial court 
found that

Wife pursued legal theories and factual contentions not warranted by existing 
law, without having evidentiary support, and  without taking time to  verify 
the  facts,  even  after  having  the  opportunity  for  further  investigation  or 
discovery.    Wife  failed  to  avail  herself  of  discovery  by  failing  to  take  any 
witness  or  opposing  party  depositions;  failing  to  disclose  witnesses  in 
discovery  as  ordered;  and  failing  to  provide  expert  reports  to  Husband’s 
counsel as ordered.  Wife never took Husband’s deposition even though he 
was the CEO, President and head person in charge at Waddell & Associates 
at  all  times  relevant  to  the  allegations  and  issues  raised  by  Wife  in  this 
divorce.  Wife incurred $170,000 in expert’s fees and she suggested that her 
expert’s testimony would support her legal theories and factual contentions.  
The  [c]ourt  finds  that  Wife  incurring  $170,000  in  expert’s  fees  and  not 
exchanging  her  expert’s  reports  was  irresponsible  and  a  waste  of  marital 
resources.    The  [c]ourt  finds  Wife’s  pattern  of  unnecessarily  draining  the 
marital  estate  to  pay  for  her  litigation  expenses  to  be  akin  to  her 
contentiousness  towards  Husband’s  decision-making  without  learning  the 
facts firsthand. . . .  Given the drain Wife’s tactics placed on the marital estate, 
the [c]ourt could have ordered Wife to pay a portion of Husband’s attorney’s 
fees had there been funds available to do so.

- 76 -

Although we will not discuss it again here, as discussed at length above, the record supports 
the  trial  court’s  finding  that  Wife’s  prosecution  of  the  divorce  was  irresponsible  and 
wasteful.    Furthermore,  the  record  shows  that  Wife  received  substantial  funds, i.e.,
approximately  $315,000.00  in  marital  assets (liquidated  by  agreement  of  the  parties), 
during  the  divorce  to  use  for  attorney’s  fees  and  expert  witnesses,  and  she  received  an 
additional $64,000.00 in marital funds a few days before trial began to use for attorney’s 
fees.  How Wife chose to apply those funds was within her discretion, but Husband should 
not be responsible for Wife’s decisions (and behavior) that caused her to accrue additional 
costs  in  prosecuting  the  divorce.    Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  the  trial  court  did  not 
abuse its discretion in ordering the parties to pay their respective attorney’s fees.

In this portion of her appellate brief, Wife also asks this Court to reverse the trial 
court’s order requiring her to pay $50,000.00 of the Special Master’s fee.  Wife failed to 
raise  the  Special  Master’s  fee  as  an  issue  in  her  statement  of  the  issues  for  appeal.  
Accordingly, this issue is waived.  See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(4); Hawkins, 86 S.W.3d at 
531.

2.  On Appeal38

Wife asks this Court to award her attorney’s fees incurred on appeal.  In Tennessee, 
“litigants  are  responsible  for  their  own  attorney’s  fees  absent  a  statute  or  agreement 
between the parties providing otherwise.”  Darvarmanesh v. Gharacholou, No. M2004-
00262-COA-R3-CV,  2005  WL  1684050,  at  *16  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  July  19,  2005)  (citing 
State v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 18 S.W.3d 186, 194 (Tenn. 2000)).  In this 
portion of her appellate brief, Wife fails to cite to any legal authority or agreement between 
the parties that would allow for her attorney’s fees to be paid by Husband.  However, we 
note  that  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  36-5-103(c)  allows  this  Court,  in  its 
discretion,  to  award  attorney’s  fees  “in  regard  to  any  suit  or  action  concerning  the 
adjudication of the custody . . . of any child[.]”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-103(c).  Aside 
from Wife’s waiver of this issue, see Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(A); Forbess, 370 S.W.3d 
at 355,  as  discussed,  supra,  we  agree  with  the  trial  court  that  the  way  in  which  Wife 
prosecuted  the  divorce  was  irresponsible  and  wasteful.    Unfortunately,  Wife’s  reckless
prosecution continues in her pursuit of this appeal.  As discussed at length in this Opinion, 
Wife  has:  (1)  pursued  legal  theories  on  appeal  that  she  conceded  at  trial; (2)  made 
arguments in her briefing that she failed to designate as issues in the appeal; (3) wholly 
ignored  portions  of  the  record  to  advance  her  allegations;  (4)  presented “factual” 
allegations without citation to the record and in contradiction to the evidence in the record; 
(5) often failed to present cogent arguments to support her allegations; and (6) often failed 
to cite to relevant legal authority to support her arguments.  Given the foregoing, we deny 
Wife’s request for appellate attorney’s fees.

                                           

38 This section addresses Wife’s eleventh and final issue: “Should Wife be awarded her reasonable 

attorney’s fees and expenses incurred on appeal?”

- 77 -

V.  Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and vacate in part the 
trial court’s orders.  Specifically, we affirm the trial court’s: (1) grant of the DSW Trust 
#2’s motion to revise and motion to dismiss; (2) denial of Wife’s motion for leave to amend 
the complaint and her revised and supplemental motion for leave to amend complaint and 
petition  to  set  aside  fraudulent  transfer  and  to  join  third-party  transferees;  (3)  denial  of 
Wife’s second motion for a continuance; (4) grant of the motions in limine; (5) decision to 
exclude evidence related to the trusts at trial;  (6) denial of an upward deviation in child 
support;  (7)  transitional  alimony  award;  (8)  denial  of  Wife’s  request  for  retroactive 
temporary  alimony  and/or  attorney’s  fees;  and  (9)  order  that  the  parties  shall  pay  their 
respective  attorney’s  fees from  trial.    We  reverse:  (1)  the  trial  court’s  designation  of 
Husband as Saylor’s primary residential parent; (2) the trial court’s award of sole decision-
making authority to Husband; and (3) the duration of the child support award.  We vacate 
the trial court’s denial of Wife’s request for retroactive temporary child support.  We deny 
Wife’s request for appellate attorney’s fees.  Finally, due to Wife’s waiver, as discussed at 
length, supra, we do not address the trial court’s: (1) grant of the motions to revise and the 
motions to dismiss of W&A, LLC, AMWJR, Inc., the Waddell Trust, and the DSW Trust; 
and (2) orders concerning Wife’s devices, email accounts, and electronic storage accounts.  
The case is remanded for such further proceedings as are necessary and consistent with this 
opinion.  Costs of the appeal are assessed one-half to the Appellant, Stacie Nicole Martin 
Waddell, and one-half to the Appellee, David Sewall Waddell, for all of which execution 
may issue if necessary.
