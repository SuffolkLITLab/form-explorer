      <pre>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT NASHVILLE
January 5, 2023, Session

JANICE NEWMAN KROHN v. KENNETH B. KROHN

Appeal from the Circuit Court for Davidson County

No. 13D3060 

Judge Joseph P. Binkley, Jr.

___________________________________

No. M2021-01020- COA-R3-CV
___________________________________

A mother obtained an order of protection against her son in general sessions court.  The
son appealed to circuit court.  Through the parties’ inaction, the case languished for more 
than five years, leading to the circuit court dismissing the case.  In response, the son filed 
various motions and documents seeking restoration of the case to the docket and further 
relief, which resulted in a hearing and additional orders being entered by the circuit court.  
Through these orders, the circuit court ruled in accordance with the son’s position that the 
order of protection was no longer in effect and had not been in effect for years.  The circuit
court  also  concluded  that, given  the  parties’  inaction  and  because  the  case  had  become 
moot, dismissal rather than restoration to the docket was appropriate.  The son appealed. 
We conclude that for purposes of this appeal the case is moot.     

Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed

JEFFREY USMAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which FRANK G. CLEMENT, JR.,
P.J., M.S., and ANDY D. BENNETT, J., joined.

Kenneth B. Krohn, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pro se.1

OPINION

I.

This is an unusual case.  This appeal involves a continuing challenge to an order of 
protection that has not existed for more than eight years that was granted to a woman who 
has since unfortunately passed away and whose estate has elected not to participate in the
appeal.  In other words, this case involves the appeal of a non-existent order of protection 
for  a  deceased  person  with  no  appellee  appearing. Further  contributing  to  the  unusual 

                                           

1 The  appellee,  Janice  Newman  Krohn,  died  on  March  28,  2022.    Her  estate  did  not  file  a 

responsive brief or participate in oral argument.  

03/14/2023nature of this case, through the parties’ inaction, this case sat dormant in the circuit court 
for more than half a decade.  Plus, the appellant prevailed before the circuit court.  

At the center of this odd case is unfortunately a disturbing circumstance within a 
family in which an order of protection was obtained by a mother against her son.  In April 
2013, then-74-year-old Kenneth Krohn of Cambridge, Massachusetts, called his then-99-
year-old mother,  Janice  Krohn, to  discuss  visiting her  in  Nashville,  Tennessee, for  his 
upcoming 75th birthday.  From the record, it is not clear precisely what was said, but the 
conversation appears to have touched upon longstanding family disputes and apparently
upset Ms. Krohn significantly.  She told her son that she would call him back, but she did
not do so.  For the next several days, she did not answer any of his follow-up calls.  

Instead, Ms.  Krohn filed  a  petition  in  the  General  Sessions  Court  for  Davidson 
County seeking an order of protection against her son.  In her petition, she described the 
basis for the order as follows:

TELEPHONE ABUSE

THREATEN  VISITS  TO  MY  HOME  – I  TELL  HIM  I  DO  NOT WANT 
HIM TO COME HOME.

ABUSE CONVERSATION IS FRIGHTENING

The last time we talked on the phone was March 15, 2013[.] Other calls have 
come in but he is so abusive I don’t answer or take the phone off the hook. 

The  general  sessions  court  issued  a  temporary  order  of  protection  on  April  23, 
2013.  After a hearing on October 28, 2013, the general sessions court issued an order of 
protection prohibiting all contact.  The order was set to expire one year later on October 
28, 2014.  On the date of the issuance of the order, Mr. Krohn appealed the matter to the 
Davidson County Circuit Court.  After Mr. Krohn filed his appeal, the general sessions 
court issued another order, this one an open-ended order which purported to extend the 
order of protection until the appeal was resolved in the circuit court. 

A de novo trial in the circuit court was originally set for November 21, 2013, but 
the parties agreed to reset it to January 16, 2014.  A trial did not occur on that date and the 
trial was not rescheduled.  Litigation, however, continued.  After the circuit court issued 
some  discovery-related  orders  unfavorable  to  Mr.  Krohn,  he sought  the  recusal  of  the 
circuit court judge.  The first circuit court judge recused himself on September 4, 2014, 
and the case was reassigned.  In October 2014, after the new judge denied several of Mr. 
Krohn’s discovery-related motions, he sought to disqualify the judge.  After the denial of
Mr. Krohn’s motion for disqualification, he appealed to the Tennessee Court of Appeals.  
This court affirmed the circuit court’s denial of Mr. Krohn’s disqualification motion on 

- 2 -

September  22,  2015.    Krohn  v.  Krohn,  No.  M2015-01280-COA-T10B-CV,  2015  WL 
5772549, at *11 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 22, 2015), perm. app. denied (Tenn.  Oct. 28, 2015).  
Mr. Krohn then sought permission to appeal the denial of his motion for disqualification 
of the circuit court judge to the Tennessee Supreme Court.  After the Tennessee Supreme 
Court  denied  permission  to  appeal,  this  court  issued  a  mandate  to  the  circuit court  on 
December 4, 2015.  Following this mandate, with the case having returned to circuit court, 
no further action was taken by either party for approximately five and a half years.  

Then, on April 27, 2021, the circuit court issued an order sua sponte dismissing the 
case as a result of the parties’ extended period of inaction.  Mr. Krohn responded with a 
motion to restore the case to the court’s active docket, which the circuit court treated as a 
Rule 59.04 motion to alter or amend.  With no action in the case for over five years, Ms. 
Krohn, who was by then well over 100 years  old, did not file a timely response to Mr. 
Krohn’s motion before a hearing occurred on July 16, 2021.  Accordingly, at the hearing, 
Mr. Krohn requested that the court grant his motion under Local Rule section 26.04(g), 
which  states,  “if  no  response  is  timely  filed  and  personally  served,  the  motion  shall  be 
granted and  counsel  or  pro se  litigant  need  not  appear  in  court  at  the  time  and  date 
scheduled for the hearing.”  The court declined this request, stating that the local rule does 
not apply to cases involving domestic abuse orders of protection.  The circuit court then 
held a hearing on the  merits of Mr. Krohn’s motion.  Mr. Krohn states that he was not 
prepared  for  this  scheduled  hearing  because  he  believed  his motion  would  be  granted 
without a hearing under the local rule.  As a result, after the hearing, Mr. Krohn followed 
up with an additional motion styled as a  motion for a declaratory judgment, asking the 
court  to  find  that  the  order  of  protection  was not  properly  extended and had,  therefore, 
expired. 

The  court  issued  an  order addressing  Mr.  Krohn’s  motion  to  reinstate  and  his 
motion for a declaratory judgment on July 29, 2021.  In this order, the circuit court found 
that neither  party  requested  a  hearing  related  to  the  extension  of  the  original  order  of 
protection as required by Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-3-605(b).  Therefore, the 
court found the order of protection expired on October 28, 2014.  The open-ended order 
of the general sessions court purporting to extend it until the appeal was resolved in the
circuit court was invalid.  Because the circuit court found that the order of protection that 
was being challenged had expired approximately seven years earlier, the circuit court held 
that the appeal before it was now moot.  The circuit court also reiterated its earlier holding 
that the parties had not taken any action in the case since December 2015 and that it was 
within its inherent authority to dismiss a case for failure to prosecute.  Accordingly, the 
circuit court denied Mr. Krohn’s motion to have the case placed back on the active docket.  

On appeal, Mr. Krohn, who has sought and received extensions related to filing his 
briefing in  this  court,  raises  three  issues  which  we  rephrase  and  restate for  purposes  of 
clarity  as  follows:  (1)  whether  the  circuit court  erred  in  finding  that  the  case  was  moot 
when  Mr.  Krohn faces  collateral  consequences  related  to  the  order  of  protection,  (2) 

- 3 -

whether  the  circuit court  abused  its  discretion  when  it  dismissed  the  case  for  failure  to 
prosecute,  and  (3)  whether  the  circuit court  abused  its  discretion  when  it  declined  to 
automatically grant his motion to restore the case to the active docket under Local Rule
section 26.04(g) when Ms. Krohn filed no response to the motion.  For the reasons stated 
below,  we  find  that  this  appeal is  moot;  consequently,  we  do  not  reach  the  second  and 
third issues advanced by Mr. Krohn.

Before  we  can  address  the  merits  of  Mr.  Krohn’s  claims,  we  must  resolve  a 
threshold jurisdictional issue.  The Tennessee Supreme Court has indicated that the role 
of the courts “is limited to deciding issues that qualify as justiciable, meaning issues that 
place some real interest in dispute.”  City of Memphis v. Hargett, 414 S.W.3d 88, 96 (Tenn. 
2013) (citing Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Morgan, 263 S.W.3d 827, 838 (Tenn. 2008)). We 
must practice restraint in addressing issues when the parties “do not have a continuing, 
real,  live,  and  substantial  interest  in  the  outcome.”    Norma  Faye  Pyles  Lynch  Family
Purpose LLC v. Putnam Cnty., 301 S.W.3d 196, 210 (Tenn. 2009).  

A case becomes moot when the legal controversy has been extinguished, City of 
Memphis, 414 S.W.3d at 96, or it “no longer serves as a means to provide some sort of 
judicial relief to the prevailing party.”  Norma Faye, 301 S.W.3d at 204.   For example, 
“a suit brought to enjoin a particular act becomes moot once the act sought to be enjoined 
takes  place.”  McIntyre  v.  Traughber,  884  S.W.2d  134,  137  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 1994);  see 
also State ex rel. Lewis v. State, 208 Tenn. 534, 538, 347 S.W.2d 47, 48 (1961) (finding 
that the court “would not consider the question where nothing could be done but remove 
an unfaithful officer from public office, when his office has expired. . . .”). 

The  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  has,  however, recognized  mootness  exceptions.  
Shaw v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 651 S.W.3d 907, 912 (Tenn. 2022). 
As  has  been  correctly  noted  by  Mr.  Krohn,  these  exceptions include  the  circumstance 
when the primary subject of a dispute has become moot, but collateral consequences to 
one of the parties remain.  Norma Faye, 301 S.W.3d at 204.  The paradigmatic illustration 
of  collateral  consequences  as  an  exception  to  mootness  occurs  with  an appeal  of a 
conviction where the sentence has been served by the time of an appeal being considered,
but the party continues to suffer collateral consequences stemming from the conviction.  
See, e.g., Wayne R. LaFave et al., 7 Crim. Proc. § 27.5(a) (4th ed. 2022) (observing that 
“[t]he most significant barrier to finding an appeal moot after a sentence has been served 
is known as the collateral consequences exception. A case is not moot, notwithstanding 
full  satisfaction  of  the  sentence,  if  the  defendant  is  still  subject  to  a  collateral  legal 
disability as a result of his conviction”).  

We assume arguendo that Mr. Krohn is correct that there are continuing collateral 
consequences stemming from an order of protection having been granted against him in 

II.

- 4 -

2013.  Even with this assumption on behalf of Mr. Krohn’s position, the problem is that
alleviating those collateral consequences runs squarely into the limits of the reach of the 
relief that Mr. Krohn informed the circuit court he was seeking.  

During  oral  argument,  the  following  exchange  occurred  in  connection  with 
exploring how the collateral consequences that Mr. Krohn asserts he continues to suffer 
from could be redressed in this case:

Judge’s Question: Mr. Krohn . . .  I am struggling to see how the collateral 
consequences could be lifted here. . . .  You mentioned stigma. . . . There is 
no order of protection. . . . It has been dissolved.  It does not exist.  What 
further action could a trial court take?  Let’s say it goes back.  What could 
the  trial  court  do  to  alleviate  those collateral  consequences  that  you  are 
suffering.    I  understand  that  you  saying  that  there  are  enduring  collateral 
consequences  of  this.   But,  I  am  struggling  to  see  how  a  trial  court  could 
remedy that.

Mr. Krohn: Very simply your honor. . . .  If the trial court simply held that 
the initial petition was without merit and dismisses it, then these collateral 
consequences go away.  I no longer have the stigma. . . .    

In other words, the relief which Mr. Krohn argues would provide redress for his 
continuing collateral consequences is a declaration that the General Session Court erred 
in its initial decision to grant an order of protection.  Krohn’s case, however, suffers from 
a fatal defect.  The circuit court did not understand him to be asking for such relief nor did 
he ask for such relief from the circuit court.  

Following  dismissal  after more  than  five  years  of  inaction  from  the  parties,  in 
seeking reinstatement of the case to the docket, Mr. Krohn specified for the circuit court 
what relief he was seeking.  Mr. Krohn did not request a declaratory judgment from the 
circuit court declaring that the 2013 general sessions court should have never granted an 
order of protection.  On appeal, he now asserts such relief would address the continuing 
collateral  consequences  of  the  original  grant  of  an  order  of  protection  against  him.   
However,  before  the  circuit court,  Mr.  Krohn  instead  specified  that  he  was  seeking  a 
declaratory  judgment  “that  the  Order  to  Extend  is  unlawful  and  wholly  without  legal 
effect”  and  that  the  “2013  Protection  definitely  expired  on  October  28,  2014.”2
In  his 
                                           

2 Mr. Krohn also sought a declaratory judgment indicating “that any future order by a judge of the 
Court  of  General  Sessions  for  Davidson  County  directing  that  a  domestic  violence  order  of  protection 
issued against Respondent which has been appealed de novo to the Circuit Court shall remain in effect 
until  the  appeal  has  been  resolved  would  be  similarly  unlawful  and  wholly  without  legal  effect.”    Mr. 
Krohn noted in his briefing before the circuit court that he “possesses standing to seek . . . [this] component 
of the declaratory relief sought by this petition because of the significant possibility that Petitioner will 

- 5 -

prayer for relief, Mr. Krohn again expressly “sought a declaration that the Order to Extend 
issued  on  October  29,  2013  is  unlawful  and without  effect”  and  “a  declaration  that  the 
2013 Order of Protection issued on October 28, 2013 definitively expired on October 28, 
2014 and is no longer in effect.”3  The circuit court ruled for Mr. Krohn on both of these 
matters,  granting  him  this  relief.    The  circuit court  determined  that  the  general  session 
court’s open-ended extension order (the Order to Extend) was invalid.  The circuit court 
also determined that the order of protection expired on October 28, 2014, and is no longer 
in effect.  Mr. Krohn did include in his prayer for relief a request for “any other relief to 
which Respondent might justly be entitled.”  He did not, however, inform the circuit court 
that  he  was  seeking  as  a  form  of  relief  a  declaration  that  the  order  of  protection never 
should  have  been  granted by  the  general  sessions  court.   Accordingly,  the  circuit court 
concluded the matter had become moot.

There does not appear to be any error in the circuit court’s apprehending of what 
Mr. Krohn stated in terms of the relief that he was seeking.  Nevertheless, as noted above, 
Mr.  Krohn  insists  that  the  circuit court  erred  and  that  his  case  is  not  moot based  upon
continuing  collateral  consequences.    Mr.  Krohn  has  indicated  that  these  collateral 
consequences can be addressed through a form of relief of a declaration that he did not 
seek from the circuit court.  An appeal is moot where the appellant has received from the 
circuit court the relief requested.4  Accordingly, this matter has become moot.       

                                           
seek  in  the  Court  of  General  Sessions  for  Davidson  County  yet  another domestic  violence  order  of 
protection  against  Respondent  after  the  expiration  of  the  one contended  presently  to  be  in  effect.”  
Unfortunately, Ms. Krohn has passed away.  With her death, this third component of relief is no longer at 
issue.  Consequently, Mr. Krohn unsurprisingly  has not addressed this  matter on appeal  in arguing for 
continuing justiciability of this case.  Accordingly, this matter is not before this court.

3 Mr. Krohn also sought in his prayer for relief an award of court costs.  The circuit court concluded that 
under Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-3-617(a)(1) an award of court costs to Mr. Krohn would be 
improper.  He has not argued on appeal that the circuit court erred in this determination; accordingly, this 
matter is not before this court.  

4  See, e.g., Bynum v. Savage, 847 S.W.2d 705, 706 (Ark.1993) (“[T]he party asking us to consider an 
otherwise moot issue obtained exactly the relief she requested. A party who prevails has no ground for 
appeal.”);  Rosa  v.  Fischer,  87  A.D.3d  1252,  1253  (N.Y.  App.  Div.  2011) (“Given  that  petitioner  has 
received all the relief requested in his petition and to which he is entitled, the matter is moot . . . .  Although 
petitioner argues in his brief that the actual time computation was improper, he has not preserved this claim 
due to his failure to raise  it in the petition.”); McCullough v. Eleventh Jud. Dist. Ct. in & for Cnty. of 
Pershing, 520 P.3d 826 (Nev. 2022)(“[I]t appears that petitioner has received the relief requested and this 
petition is moot.”); Patton v. Nevada Bd. of Parole Comm’rs, No. 85239-COA, 2023 WL 1438406, at *2

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
