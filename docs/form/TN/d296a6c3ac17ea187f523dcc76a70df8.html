      <pre>Preparation and Practice Are Key to Successful Remote Mediations 

By Elizabeth Yarbrough  
Attorney/TSC Rule 31 listed Family Mediator (DV) 

Like it or not, remote mediation is here to stay.  

Now that we are all living under the constant threat of 

contracting or unwittingly transmitting coronavirus, 

many mediators (myself included), lawyers and 

parties may be unwilling or unable to participate in 

mediation in person.  Fortunately, remote mediation allows for continued access to this 

process even when in person meetings are not possible.  While many practitioners are 

wary of remote mediation, the most common concerns can be addressed with a shift in 

thinking and the acquisition of some new skills and a few new software products.  

Remote mediation need not compromise the value of the experience for the participants 

or limit business opportunities for mediators.  Concerns about the privacy and 

confidentiality of the process can be addressed through proper use of your platform and 

appropriate instructions to the parties memorialized in your materials and agreement.  

The remote option is safer, more convenient and more cost effective when no one is 

having to travel to a mediator’s office or pay their lawyer for travel time.  Remote 

mediation offers improved safety both in terms of potential contagion during a 

pandemic, and in cases where there is a potential for violence or emotional intimidation 

of one party by another.  Participants who live in rural areas where there is no mediator 

nearby will gain access to the process they may not otherwise have.   

If you are not already offering remote mediation, I would encourage you to try it.  The 

best way to become comfortable with remote mediation is to start offering this service, 

but first equip yourself with the knowledge you need to succeed.  Below are some 

strategies that have been helpful to me and colleagues who have kindly shared their 

experiences with me. 

Set the tone and create rapport and trust.  Just as you would in your own office, you 

are responsible for setting the tone for the mediation and you need to establish a 

rapport and build trust with the participants—lawyers and parties.  Because remote 

mediation is new to many, you need to focus on how to build trust in using this platform.  

When mediating at my office, I always make a point to chat with lawyers and parties for 

a few minutes and offer coffee and donuts as participants arrive and unpack. Now I try 

to make contact ahead of time with a phone call to the lawyer, especially if the lawyer is 

one with whom I have not worked recently.   

When you schedule the mediation, send a confirmation letter along with a brief 

description of the process, a summary of what clients and lawyers should expect, and 

what they will need to participate.  Remind the lawyer and his or her client that they can 

be remote from one another, and they can share documents without either of them 

having to go to an office.  It is a good idea to invite the lawyer and client to participate in 

a brief pre-mediation session of maybe ten or fifteen minutes during which you can 

show them how your video conference platform works. This will not only make them feel 

more comfortable participating remotely, it is also a great opportunity to establish 

rapport between yourself and the participants.  This is a good way to foster their trust in 

you as the mediator who is well prepared and professional.  They will see that the video 

conference platform is easy for them to use and feel more confident going into 

mediation.   

Create a safe space and emphasize privacy and confidentiality.  One of the main 

objections I have heard from lawyers who still prefer in person mediations is that they 

do not feel remote mediations can be kept private and confidential.  While it is true that 

any participant in a remote mediation could record the process surreptitiously, or have 

another person in the room who is eavesdropping off camera, the same is true of an in-

person mediation.  There is nothing but your mediation agreement, or perhaps a court 

order, stopping a participant at an in-person mediation from wearing an inexpensive 

recording device, activating a recording app on their smart phone, or calling another 

individual on the phone and leaving their phone on the table.  This is a problem that 

may feel like more of a threat for remote mediations, but that simply is not the case.   

Your mediation agreement should already provide that there may be no recording of the 

mediation, and that the process is private and confidential.  You should update your 

existing agreement to include language specifically stating that all provisions apply to 

remote mediations as well, and consider including examples of what is not allowed or 

appropriate (e.g. using the Wi-Fi at Starbucks to join the remote session, or participating 

from the living room of a participant’s home where other family members would hear or 

see the session).  Ideally, during a pre-mediation session or in your confirmation letter, 

emphasize with both the lawyer and his or her client that the rules regarding privacy are 

being prioritized for the benefit of both parties.  Most online platforms allow the host to 

prevent direct recording, so choose one with this functionality.  Demonstrating the video 

conference platform and discussing the built in security features and reviewing the 

privacy provisions in your agreement will allow you to show the participants that you are 

providing them a safe space and prioritizing their privacy.   

Using breakout rooms ensures total privacy from the other side in a manner that is 

superior to that available in most offices.  At my small office, I use Sonos speakers 

playing classical music in the hallway between my conference rooms, and white noise 

generators placed throughout my suite, but I still have to caution mediation clients to 

keep their voices low.  Any raised voices might be overheard in person, but in a 

breakout room, there is no way for the other side to hear what is happening in the other 

side’s room.  If you are using Zoom (my platform of choice), you can ensure privacy 

from unintended observers by generating a unique meeting ID and requiring a 

password, which is only provided to counsel and parties.  Utilizing a virtual waiting room 

function and locking the meeting after all participants have arrived will provide additional 

security.  Specifically enumerating all these precautions in your mediation agreement 

and demonstrating them in a pre-mediation session will build confidence in the safety of 

the remote setting for both the attorney and his or her client.   

Be prepared and help participants be prepared.  The mediator’s comfort and 

confidence in the process and the platform will come across to the other participants 

and help them to focus on resolving their dispute.  This will help to ensure a successful 

mediation. It is important that you as the mediator can conduct the session with 

confidence.  Preparation and practice with the platform you are using will ensure that 

you can smoothly operate the platform.   

There is an enormous amount of support available to learn to use video conference 

platforms.  Most products have extensive tutorials included in the platform, and a quick 

Google search will typically yield simple instructive articles and video tutorials for free.  

Many bar associations are offering CLE hours on how to use Zoom and other platforms.  

Use these resources until you become familiar enough to feel comfortable and then 

start practicing what you have learned.   

Practicing what you have learned can be fun.  Have each of your kids go to their own 

room with an iPad and play with the breakout rooms.  Tell one child a word or phrase 

and let the others guess it.  Host a Zoom cocktail hour or book club with friends and 

practice sharing photos using file sharing and screen sharing.  You will have fun and 

feel confident and secure in your abilities when you conduct your online mediation.  A 

confident mediator will ensure a less stressful experience for your participants that will 

be conducive to their ability to resolve their dispute. 

Make sure that you and all the participants have all the technology and equipment 

needed.  Having access to your video conference platform is not the only software you 

need to ensure the mediation process goes smoothly. You will also need to have the 

ability to provide a means to sign both your mediation agreement and the agreements 

you create at mediation.  DocuSign and Adobe Acrobat are popular and accessible.  If 

notary services are needed, make sure you have the ability to provide that.  

Notarize.com is an online service that you can use for a nominal fee per signature if you 

are not authorized to notarize online, or if you prefer not to do so.  You will also need to 

have a way of collecting payment electronically unless you have received payment in 

advance.  LawPay, PayPal and Venmo are all easy to use and are not prohibitively 

expensive payment processing options.  

Plan for needed hardware and equipment for yourself, and remind the participants 

about the need to have a reliable, wired internet connection.  Have access to a second 

device in case of device failure.  Remind all participants to have laptops charged with 

access to a power supply.  Do not assume that the participants will have thought of 

these issues. 

Remind participants about other considerations. Have a plan in place for what to do 

if a participant loses their internet connection.  Provide your phone number and get the 

cell numbers of each participant so that you have an alternate means of getting in touch 

with them if they lose their connection.  Make sure that all participants have a private 

place free from interruptions and that they have time to devote their full attention to 

mediation. Participants who are attending from home may not think about arranging for 

childcare and participants who are attending from their own office may not think about 

clearing their calendar, so it is incumbent upon the mediator to raise these issues.   

Show participants how to mute themselves or cover their camera so that they will not 

feel embarrassed if they get up to take a bathroom break and the entire mediation hears 

the toilet flushing.  Help clients get the added benefits available with the remote 

mediation.  Wearing more comfortable clothes, sitting in a place in their home that is 

soothing, or having a pet nearby can be of enormous benefit to parties who are nervous 

or emotional.  I recently conducted a remote mediation and one of the parties became 

extremely distraught while discussing a parenting plan modification.  I watched as her 

cat climbed into her lap and she experienced such comfort from petting the cat and I 

realized that having access to pets can be an enormous benefit not available at the 

mediator’s office.  My own dog is usually asleep at my feet when I am mediating, which 

we both enjoy. 

Be patient with yourself and others and focus on using your skills as a mediator. 

Realize that online mediation is new to most of us, and we are all learning a new way of 

doing things.  It is important to be kind and patient not only with participants but also 

with yourself, as the inevitable hiccups occur.  Prepare, do your best, and give yourself 

and others a bit of grace.  Realize that you will make mistakes and do not over-react 

when this happens.  A bit of awkwardness on the part of the mediator who is learning a 

new way of mediating can be an asset in relating to the parties, as it may make them 

less nervous about their own lack of familiarity with the setting.  Focus on using the 

skills you always use as a mediator:  listening and observing more than talking, and 

identifying the unmet needs of each party and how their agreement can best meet those 

needs, reframing ideas as proactive, solution-focused and related to the identified 

needs of the parties, and by compromise and guided decision making.  Empower 

attorneys to support their clients in reaching a good settlement by providing legal advice 

and strategic advice, but encourage them to allow their clients to avail themselves of a 

voluntary settlement opportunity. 

Get comfortable because remote mediation is not going anywhere.  Even though 

many mediators are still offering in person mediations, and many attorneys still prefer 

that setting, remote mediation is an option that is gaining popularity, with good reason.  

Remote mediations offer many benefits to all participants, that make it an attractive 

choice that will no doubt remain popular after the threat of spreading Covid19 is over.
