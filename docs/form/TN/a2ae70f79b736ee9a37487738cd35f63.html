Approved by: Chief Justice Frank F. Drowota, III and Cornelia A. Clark, Director 
Subject: Interchange, designation, and substitution of judges of general sessions and 
juvenile courts 

Authority: Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 16-15-209, 17-2-208 and applicable 
statutes. 
 
Purpose: To ensure uniformity of the procedures used in the interchange 
and  designation  of  judges  of  courts  of  general  sessions  and  juvenile 
courts. 

II. 

Application: General Sessions and juvenile court judges. 

.  Interchange  generally:  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law  to 
the  contrary,  judges  of  courts  of  general  sessions  and  juvenile  courts 
may  interchange  with  each  other  whenever  causes  exist  making  an 
interchange  necessary  or  for  mutual  convenience.  The  interchanging 
judge shall not be required to be a resident of the county as the judge 
for  whom  he  or  she  is  sitting,  but  must  otherwise  possess  the  same 
qualifications. Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-208.  

Interchange in certain divorce actions:  In counties having a population 
of over 700,000, general sessions judges may sit by interchange as a 
circuit  court  judge  or  chancellor  for  the  exclusive  purpose  of  hearing 
and  deciding  uncontested  and  irreconcilable  differences  in  divorce 
cases. Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-209(a).  

.  Designation  generally:    Whenever  litigation  in  general  sessions  or 
juvenile  courts  becomes  congested  or  delay  in  the  disposition 
becomes  imminent  for  any  reason  or  upon  request  by  any  judge,  the 
Chief  Justice  shall  assign  a  retired  or  regular  judge  to  assist  in  the 
removal  of  such  congestion  or  delay.  Such  assignment  shall  not 
materially interfere with the performance of the assigned judge’s official 
duties.  

.  Any judge has the discretion to request another judge to assist in the 
removal of congestion or delay if the original judge becomes aware of 
the  need  for  such  assistance  before  the  Chief  Justice  makes  the 
assignment.

In  such  situations,  both  the  requesting  judge  and  the  assigned  judge 
may  hear,  try  and  dispose  of  cases  in  such  court  at  the  same  time, 
both signing their respective minutes. Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-109. 

.  Designation  and  Use  of  Referees/Appointed  Officers  of  the  Judicial 
System:    In  addition  to  the  statutory  provisions  governing  the  referee 
and clerk and master positions, the referee or clerk and master can be 
appointed as a full-time officer of the judicial system in accordance with 
Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  16-15-209(g)  and  also  can  be  used  as  a  lawyer 
substitute  judge  in  accordance  with  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §16-15-
209(a)(4). 

Such  appointed  judicial  officers  shall  serve  as  a  special  judge  only  in 
matters  related  to  their  duties  as  judicial  officers.    Designation  of 
referees  or  clerks  and  masters  by  the  Chief  Justice  is  not  required  in 
such cases. 

.  Immunity  for  Judges:    Any  judge  or  lawyer  specially  appointed 
pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-109 or Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-15-
209  or  by  interchange  shall  have  the  same  immunity  as  the  judge  for 
whom  the  judge  or  lawyer  is  sitting.  The  county  where  the  special 
judge  or  lawyer  is  sitting  shall  be  required  to  provide  the  defense.  
Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-1-114.  

.  Reimbursement:    A  judge  assigned  to  a  court  outside  their  county  of 
residence  shall  receive  reimbursement  for  travel  expenses  from  the 
county  requesting  assistance  in  accordance  with  the  judicial  travel 
regulations of the supreme court. Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-15-209(b). 

.  Compensation:  The county legislative body may authorize payment of 
compensation to a special lawyer judge. The amount of compensation 
shall  not  exceed  that  of  other  judges  of  the  general  sessions  court  or 
juvenile court for such county. Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-15-209(c). 

.  Oaths:    Every  special  judge,  before  entering  on  the  duties  of  the 
judge’s  appointment,  shall  take  an  oath  before  the  clerk  of  the  court 
and file such oath with the clerk.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-120.

.  County with population of over 800,000 - See also Tenn. Code Ann. § 
16-15-209(e)  through  (h)  for  provisions  regarding  adopted  resolutions 
and  special  judge  provisions  in  any  county  having  a  population  in 
excess of 800,000. 

Procedures:  
 
 
A.  If  a  special  judge  is  necessary,  the  judge  shall  interchange  with 
another

interchange,  a  judge  may  seek  to  find  any  current,  former,  or  retired 

judge  within 

the  county.

judge who will sit as special judge. Such designation shall be made by 
the chief justice.  The judge should contact the Administrative Office of 
the Courts to process the designation order. 

B.  In a county with only one (1) general sessions judge or juvenile court 
judge, the judge shall seek to find any current, former, or retired judge 
who  will  sit  as  a  special  judge.  The  special  judge  shall  serve  by 
designation  of  the  chief  justice.  The  judge  should  contact  the 
Administrative Office of the Courts to process the designation order. 
 

C.  If a judge is disqualified by reason of a conflict of interest or other    

circumstance where the judge’s impartiality in choosing another judge 
to sit as special  judge could be questioned, the judge should apply to 
the Administrative Office of the Courts for assistance in finding a judge 
to  sit  by  interchange  or  designation.    See  Supreme  Court  Rule  10, 
Canon 3(E) regarding disqualification. 

D.  If the judge is unable to secure a judge under (1) or (2), or if the        

circumstances outlined in (3) exist, the judge may apply to the 
Administrative Office of the Courts for assistance in finding a judge to 
sit by designation as a special judge. See Tenn. Code Ann. §16-15-
209(a)(1)-(3). 

E.  The Administrative Office of the Courts, absent special circumstances, 
cannot secure a replacement when the regular judge’s absence results 
from: 
1.  attendance  at  a  conference,  educational  seminar  or  speaking 

2.  attendance at an annually scheduled state or local bar association 

engagement; 

meeting; 

3.  scheduled vacation; or 
4. 

regularly  scheduled  administrative  days  or  weeks  in  which  the 
judge rotates off the bench to handle administrative matters. 

II.  Alternate Procedure - Lawyer as Special Judge:  Only after exhausting  the  
procedures  set  forth  in  Section  VI,  a  judge  may  appoint  a  lawyer  from  a 
list, on a rotating basis, of lawyers that have been previously approved by 
the  judges  of  the  county  who  are  constitutionally  qualified,  in  good 
standing  and  possess  sufficient  experience  and  expertise.  A  lawyer 
appointed is subject to the following limitations: 

 

 

A.  The lawyer may preside only if the parties and counsel are notified that 
the duly elected or appointed judge will be absent and that a practicing 
lawyer will serve as a special judge. 

B.  The  parties  choose  to  proceed  and  not  to  continue  the  case  pending 

return of the duly elected or appointed judge; and

C.  The lawyer shall not approve the payment of attorney’s fees involving 
an  indigent  defense  claim  or  any  discretionary  fees.  A  special  judge 
shall approve fees only when the exact amount is set by statute. Tenn. 
Code Ann. §16-15-209(a)(4). 

During  the  month  of  September  each  year,  the  clerk  of  the  court  shall 
prepare,  for  each  division  of  court,  an  annual  report  for  the  preceding 
twelve  (12)  months,  setting  out  the  total  number  of  sessions  of  court 
presided over by a special judge, or by a judge sitting by interchange. The 
clerk  shall  also  report  the  total  number  of  sessions  of  court  that  are 
scheduled in each division of court for that period. The orders and reports 
required  by  this  subdivision  shall  be  filed,  and  kept  open  for  public 
inspection, by the clerk of the court. The clerk of the court shall promptly 
file  a  copy  of  such  annual  report  with  the  Administrative  Office  of  the 
Courts.   

III.   Standing Order:  A general sessions or juvenile court judge may issue and 
amend,  upon  showing  a  change  in  circumstances,  a  standing  order 
regarding compliance with the above procedures.  Such order may include 
a  finding  regarding  whether  a  current,  former  or  retired  judge  will  sit  by 
mutual  agreement,  whether  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts  can 
comply  with  emergency  requests  for  substitute  judges,  and  the  list  of 
lawyers to be contacted on a rotating basis.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-
15-209(d).
