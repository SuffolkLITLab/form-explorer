      <pre>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT KNOXVILLE
Assigned on Briefs March 2, 2023

BENJAMIN MCCURRY ET AL. v. AGNESS MCCURRY

Appeal from the Circuit Court for Washington County
No. 38147 Thomas J. Wright, Senior Judge
___________________________________

No. E2023-00297-COA-T10B-CV
___________________________________

This is an interlocutory appeal as of right, pursuant to Rule 10B of the Rules of the Supreme 
Court of Tennessee, filed by Agness McCurry (“Petitioner”), seeking to recuse the judge 
in  this  case  involving  post-divorce  parenting  issues.    Having  reviewed  the  petition  for 
recusal appeal filed by Petitioner, and finding no error, we affirm.

Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10B Interlocutory Appeal as of Right;
Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed

JOHN W. MCCLARTY, J., delivered  the  opinion  of  the  court,  in  which  W.  NEAL 
MCBRAYER and KENNY W. ARMSTRONG, JJ., joined.

Agness McCurry, Johnson City, Tennessee, pro se appellant.

Sandy Phillips, Johnson City, Tennessee, for the appellee, Benjamin McCurry.

Jeffrey M. Ward, Greeneville, Tennessee, for the appellee, Amy Briggs.

OPINION

We begin by noting that in her petition for recusal appeal, Petitioner made several 
statements  showing  disrespect  or  contempt  for  this  Court  and  for  the  Circuit  Court  for 
Washington County (“the Trial Court”).  If this were not a Rule 10B recusal appeal, this 
Court would strike the entire petition, and it would not be considered.  See Tenn. R. Ct. 
App.  9  (“Any  brief  or  written  argument  containing  language  showing  disrespect or 
contempt for any court of Tennessee will be stricken from the files, and this Court will take 
such further action relative thereto as it may deem proper.”).  Given, however, that “[t]he 
right to a fair trial before an impartial tribunal is a fundamental constitutional right,” this 

03/22/2023Court has chosen to consider the substance of the petition.  Bean v. Bailey, 280 S.W.3d 
798, 803 (Tenn. 2009).  The offensive portions of Petitioner’s petition for recusal appeal 
are hereby deemed stricken, and the Appellate Court Clerk is directed to seal the petition 
for recusal appeal so that the public shall not have access to this document in the future.  
Petitioner  is  cautioned  that  language  showing  disrespect  or  contempt  for  any  court  of 
Tennessee will not be tolerated in future filings.  

Along with her petition for recusal appeal, Petitioner submitted a flash drive, which 
allegedly contains a recording of the proceedings held in the Trial Court on February 7, 
2023.  The Trial Court noted in its February 16, 2023 order denying the motion for recusal 
that  Petitioner  was  using  her  cellular  phone  to  surreptitiously  record the  proceedings  in 
court that day.  The flash drive submitted by Petitioner was not admitted into evidence and 
was  not  approved  by  the  Trial  Court.    Nor  does  it  qualify  as  a  properly  authenticated 
transcript.  As such, it would be improper for this Court to consider the contents of the flash 
drive.  This Court will not consider the improperly submitted flash drive in addressing this 
appeal.

Turning to the allegations in the petition for recusal appeal, we have determined in 
this  case  after  a  review  of  the  petition  and  supporting  documents  submitted  with  the 
petition,  that  an  answer,  additional  briefing,  and  oral  argument  are  unnecessary  to  our 
disposition.  As such, we have elected to act summarily on this appeal in accordance with 
sections 2.05 and 2.06 of Rule 10B.  See Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10B, § 2.05 (“If the appellate 
court, based upon its review of the petition for recusal appeal and supporting documents, 
determines that no answer from the other parties is needed, the court may act summarily 
on the appeal.  Otherwise, the appellate court shall order that an answer to the petition be 
filed by the other parties.  The court, in its discretion, also may order further briefing by 
the parties within the time period set by the court.”); § 2.06 (“An accelerated interlocutory 
appeal shall be decided by the appellate court on an expedited basis.  The appellate court’s 
decision, in the court’s discretion, may be made without oral argument.”).

We review a trial court’s ruling on a motion for recusal under a de novo standard of 
review  with  no  presumption  of  correctness.    Tenn.  Sup.  Ct.  R.  10B  § 2.01.    “The  party 
seeking  recusal  bears  the  burden  of  proof,  and  ‘any  alleged  bias  must  arise  from 
extrajudicial  sources  and  not  from  events  or  observations  during  litigation  of  a  case.’”  
Neamtu v. Neamtu, No. M2019-00409-COA-T10B-CV, 2019 WL 2849432, at *2 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. July 2, 2019) (quoting Williams by & through Rezba v. HealthSouth Rehab. Hosp. 
N., No. W2015-00639-COA-T10B-CV, 2015 WL 2258172, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 8, 
2015).  As this Court explained in Neamtu v. Neamtu:

“[A] party challenging the impartiality of a judge ‘must come forward with 
some  evidence  that  would  prompt  a  reasonable,  disinterested  person  to 
believe that the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.’”  Duke, 
398 S.W.3d at 671 (quoting Eldridge v. Eldridge, 137 S.W.3d 1, 7-8 (Tenn. 
- 2 -

Ct. App. 2002)).  When reviewing requests for recusal alleging bias, “it is 
important  to  keep  in  mind  the  fundamental  protections  that  the  rules  of 
recusal are intended to provide.”  In re A.J., No. M2014-02287-COA-R3-JV, 
2015 WL 6438671, at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2015), perm. app. denied
(Tenn.  Feb.  18,  2016).  “The  law  on  judicial  bias  is  intended  ‘to  guard 
against the prejudgment of the rights of litigants and to avoid situations 
in  which the litigants  might  have cause to conclude that the court  had 
reached  a  prejudged  conclusion  because  of  interest,  partiality,  or 
favor.’”  Id. (quoting Bean v. Bailey, 280 S.W.3d 798, 803 (Tenn. 2009)).

The terms “bias” and “prejudice” usually refer to a state of mind or 
attitude that works to predispose a judge for or against a party, but not every 
bias, partiality, or prejudice merits recusal.  Watson v. City of Jackson, 448 
S.W.3d 919, 929 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2014) (citing Alley v. State, 882  S.W.2d 
810, 821 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994)).  “‘Even though the judge is expected 
to have no bias at the beginning of the trial, he must, perforce, develop 
a bias at some point in the trial; for the decision at the conclusion of the 
trial is based upon the impressions, favorable or unfavorable, developed 
during the trial.’”  Id. at 933 (quoting Spain v. Connolly, 606 S.W.2d 540, 
544 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980)).  To merit disqualification, the prejudice must be 
of a personal character, directed at the litigant, and stem from an extrajudicial 
source resulting in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what 
the judge learned from participation in the case.  Id. at 929.  “A trial judge’s 
opinions of the parties or witnesses that are based on what he or she has seen 
at trial are not improper and ‘generally do[ ] not warrant recusal.’”  Id. at 933
(quoting Neuenschwander v. Neuenschwander, No. E2001-00306-COA-R3-
CV, 2001 WL 1613880, at *11 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2001)).

Neamtu,  2019  WL  2849432,  at  *3  (quoting  In  re  Samuel  P.,  No.  W2016-01592-COA-
T10B-CV, 2016 WL 4547543, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2016) (emphasis in original).

The  only  order  this  Court  may  review  in  a  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  Rule  10B 
recusal  appeal  is  the  trial  court’s  order  denying  a  motion  to  recuse.    Duke  v.  Duke,  398 
S.W.3d  665,  668  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2012)  (“Pursuant  to  [Tennessee  Supreme  Court  Rule 
10B], we may not review the correctness or merits of the trial court’s other rulings . . ..”).  

In  her  petition  for  recusal  appeal,  Petitioner  asserts  that  Judge  Wright should  be 
recused because he incarcerated her due to her immigration status and made xenophobic 
statements  about  said  status.    Petitioner  is  mistaken.    In  the  February  16,  2023  order 
denying  Petitioner’s  motion  to  recuse,  the  Trial  Court  explained  that Petitioner  was 
incarcerated for contempt of court.  The Trial Court then carefully and thoroughly analyzed 
Petitioner’s  allegations  of  bias.    We quote  liberally  from  the Trial  Court’s February  16, 
2023 order, which states:

- 3 -

Mother appears to raise three separate grounds for recusal, though all appear 
to be premised upon her lawful permanent residence status under VAWA. 

1. Allegation of deprivation of rights under color of law. 

The underlying factual basis for Mother’s Motion to Recuse appears 
to be the fact that she was ordered into custody for contempt of court on two 
separate  occasions  during  a  recent  hearing  February  7,  2023.  Separate 
contempt Orders were filed contemporaneously with the orders that she be 
placed in custody on February 7, 2023 and clearly state the Court’s grounds 
for her incarceration. 

Ms.  McCurry  was  found  to  be  in  contempt  of  court  for  ignoring 
repeated  requests  and  orders  from  the  Bench  that  she  stop  talking.  It  is 
impossible for the Court to conduct an orderly proceeding when participants 
refuse  to  follow  the  explicit  orders  from  the  Judge  regarding  who  is  to  be 
talking,  and  when.  Ms.  McCurry  alleges  that  she  was  sentenced  “to 
incarceration  due  to evidence  provided  to  the  Court  that  she  was  a  lawful 
permanent resident under the Violence Against Women Act. . . .” Mother’s 
Motion at p. 1.  She goes on to state that the undersigned “ordered for Agness 
to be incarcerated due to being a lawful permanent resident under VAWA, 
but he also subjected Agness to ‘punishments’ and ‘pains’ by the Sheriff’s 
Office based off her immigration status.”

Ms.  McCurry’s  incarceration  had  only  to  do  with  maintaining  the 
dignity and authority of the Court and insisting upon an orderly presentation 
of arguments and testimony as well as appropriate decorum during the trial 
proceedings.  She  was  ultimately  sanctioned  with  a  term  of  24  hours 
incarceration for her repeated refusal to obey the orders of the Court, which 
resulted in the obstruction of the administration of justice. 

2. Allegation that Mother was deprived of Due Process. 

Mother alleges that she was deprived of Due Process because she was 
“discriminated against by Judge Wright due to her lawful permanent resident 
status  under  VAWA.” Mother’s  Motion  at  p.  3.  Mother  has  not  been 
discriminated against by the undersigned in this proceeding.  Any participant 
in Court that disobeyed repeated orders and obstructed the administration of 
justice would have been treated exactly as Ms. McCurry was.  Again, none 
of her treatment had any relation to her lawful permanent resident status. 

Ms. McCurry has actually been provided with a heightened level of 

- 4 -

Due Process in this case, some at her insistence, and some because she is Pro 
Se, and some because she already believed she had been mistreated by the 
judiciary  at  the  trial  and  appellate  levels  in  this  case.  For  instance,  at  her 
request an out of State witness was allowed to testify via Webex.  Special 
arrangements were made by the Clerk’s office to provide her witness access 
to the proceedings. (Typically, the attorney is required to provide the web 
access for a remote participant.)  This was done without any showing as to 
the nature or necessity of the testimony. 

As it turned out, the witness had very little firsthand knowledge of any 
facts.  Most  of  her  testimony  consisted  of  sharing  her  opinions  and 
conclusions  about  Ms.  McCurry  and  the  way  she  has  been  treated,  and 
repeating  what  Ms.  McCurry  had  told  her.  Nevertheless,  the  witness  was 
allowed to testify extensively.  Ms. McCurry and her remote witness were 
given  wide  latitude,  not  ordinarily  provided  to  a  litigant  represented  by  an 
attorney,  with  regard  to  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  remote  witness’
testimony. 

Typically, the undersigned does not allow witnesses to testify via the 
Internet.  It is difficult to assess their demeanor and veracity via a head shot 
on a screen.  When a witness is absent from the courtroom it is impossible to 
tell  if  they  are  referring to  other  materials,  or  if  there  are  other  persons 
present, and if they are receiving information from others that might affect 
their testimony.  For example, in this particular case, when Ms. McCurry was 
ordered into custody on the initial contempt she was able to call the remote 
witness on her cell phone while the deputies were attempting to take her into 
custody, all while also surreptitiously recording all of the court proceedings, 
including her encounter with law enforcement.  Because Ms. McCurry was 
allowed to have her telephone in the courtroom she could have also provided 
the  remote  witness  with  access  to  court  proceedings  prior  to  the  remote 
witness’ testimony in violation of the Rule of Sequestration which had been 
invoked at the beginning of the case.  She could have texted information to 
the remote witness during cross examination.  For all these reasons remote 
testimony  is  rarely  allowed.  However,  this  extraordinary  treatment  was 
provided  to  Ms.  McCurry  because  of  the  facts  mentioned  above  to  ensure 
that Ms. McCurry could have no Due Process concerns.

In addition, Ms. McCurry was allowed to present evidence and cross 
examine  Father’s  witnesses  as  well  as  engage  in  arguments  regarding 
evidentiary rulings and legal issues.  Unfortunately, she is unwilling to accept 
court  rulings  that  she  disagrees  with  and  appears  to  be  incapable  of  not 
interrupting  opposing  counsel  or  the  Court  when  statements  are  made  that 
she disputes. 

- 5 -

Further,  within  the  last  year,  Ms.  McCurry  has  filed  at  least  five 
appeals  in  this  case,  including  three  appeals  since  the  undersigned  was 
designated to hear the case, but before any hearing had ever been held.  All 
of  her  appeals  have  been  resolved  unfavorably  for  her  but  mostly  because 
she  was  trying  to  appeal  a  ruling  that  was  not  a  final  order  or  judgment.  
Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals has reviewed her appellate issues at least 
five times within the last year, and from there the Supreme Court has also 
reviewed her appellate issues more than once. 

As explained in previous Orders from this Court, the undersigned has 
been attempting to provide Ms. McCurry with a hearing on the merits on the 
Ex  Parte  Order  for  Custody  suspending  her  parenting  time  since  the 
undersigned was designated to hear the case.  The actions of the undersigned 
and the judiciary of the State of Tennessee are not depriving Ms. McCurry 
of Due Process.  It is hard to conceive of a litigant receiving more “process”
than Ms. McCurry. 

3. Allegation of Manifestation of Bias and Prejudice. 

Mother  contends  that  the  undersigned  has  manifested  bias  and 
prejudice, and that this “was due to Agness (sic) ‘national origin’ as a lawful 
permanent  resident  under  VAWA  (Violence  Against  Women  and  Abused 
Spouses).” Mother’s Motion at p. 4.  As explained above, the undersigned’s 
actions have had nothing to do with Ms. McCurrys’ [sic] national origin or 
her  status  as  a  lawful  permanent  resident  under  VAWA.  She  was  treated 
exactly  as  any  other  trial  participant  in  similar  circumstances  would  have 
been.

She  further  states  that  she  was  incarcerated  for  24  hours  “due  to 
knowledge of Agness (sic) Federal lawsuit at the United States District Court 
against the Tennessee Court of  Appeals Eastern Division. . . .” id at p. 4.  
Again, her incarceration was for contempt of court.  It was not based upon 
her filing suit against the Court of Appeals.  The undersigned learned for the 
first time that a suit against the Court of Appeals existed during the hearing 
on February 71.  This knowledge played no role in the decision to incarcerate
Ms. McCurry for contempt. 

                                           

1 Following the February 7 hearing, in a separate Order, the parties were directed to bring related 
documents  from  the  Federal  Court  lawsuit  to  the  continued  hearing  on  the  Ex  Parte Order  for  Custody 
because  statements  and  allegations  made  in  those  documents  might be  relevant  to  Father’s  claim  that 
Mother is experiencing delusional thinking.

- 6 -

The undersigned is not biased or prejudiced against Ms. McCurry at 
all.  Ms.  McCurry  was  sanctioned  for  contempt  of  court  due  to  her  willful 
disobedience  to  the  direct  orders  of  the  Court,  and  the  obstruction of  the 
orderly  administration  of  justice,  and  her  challenge  to  the  dignity  and 
authority of the Court.  There is no basis for recusal in this case.

(footnote in original).

It  is  clear  from  the  Trial  Court’s  February  16,  2023  order  that  Petitioner  was 
incarcerated  due  to  her  behavior  in  court,  not  due  to  her  immigration  status.    The  Trial 
Court’s orders finding Petitioner in contempt are not before us.  As noted above, the only 
order this Court may review in a Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 10B recusal appeal is the 
trial court’s order denying a motion to recuse.  Duke, 398 S.W.3d at 668.  Petitioner has 
failed to show that Judge Wright’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

As  discussed  above,  Petitioner,  as  the  party  seeking  recusal,  bore  the  burden  of 
proof.  Petitioner failed to produce “evidence that would prompt a reasonable, disinterested 
person to believe that the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”  Neamtu, 
2019 WL 2849432, at *3 (quoting In re Samuel P., 2016 WL 4547543, at *2).  As such, 
we find no error in the Trial Court’s February 16, 2023 order denying recusal.  

Discerning no error in Judge Wright’s denial of Petitioner’s motion for recusal, we 
hereby  affirm  the  decision.    The  offensive  portions  of  Petitioner’s  petition  for  recusal 
appeal are hereby deemed STRICKEN, and the Appellate Court Clerk is directed to SEAL 
the petition for recusal appeal so that the public shall not have access to this document in 
the future.  The costs of this appeal are taxed to Petitioner, Agness McCurry, for which 
execution may issue.  This case is remanded for further proceedings.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
