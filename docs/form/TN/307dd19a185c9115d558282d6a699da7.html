overnmental  entities  generally  are  immune  from  suit.  But  the  Governmental  Tort 
Liability  Act  removes  immunity  for  certain  injuries  caused  by  the  negligent  acts  of  an 
employee.  In  this  case,  we  consider  whether  the  term  “negligent”  in  the  Act’s  removal 
provision is limited to ordinary negligence or instead also encompasses gross negligence 
or  recklessness.  We  hold  that  the  Act  removes  immunity  only  for  ordinary  negligence. 
Because  the  Court  of  Appeals  held  to  the  contrary,  we  reverse  the  decision  below  and 
remand for further proceedings.

I. 

. 

  A

n the early morning hours of February 22, 2019, a mudslide washed away part of 
Highway 70 on Clinch Mountain in Hawkins County, Tennessee.2 A driver traveling north 
on Highway 70 called the Hawkins County Emergency Communications District (“ECD-
911”) at 12:58 a.m. to report that trees were blocking the road. The driver warned the 911 
dispatcher that the highway was “cut off” and that a driver “going up the mountain” would 
“go off the road.”  

 Hawkins County deputy was dispatched to the scene about five minutes later and 
arrived  before  1:13  a.m.  Once  at  the  scene,  the  deputy  called  ECD-911  and  advised 
contacting the highway department to report a “big mudslide” and a leaning power pole. 
Although the dispatcher expressed concern that “one of these days . . . the whole mountain 
is just gon’ come down,” neither the dispatcher nor the deputy discussed closing the road. 
Instead, the dispatcher jokingly warned the deputy not to “let a rock fall on” him.  

rom around 1:21 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., the dispatcher placed calls to the Tennessee 
Department  of  Transportation,  the  director  of  the  Hawkins  County  Emergency 
Management Agency (“EMA”), and Holston Electric Company.  

ifteen  minutes later,  at about 1:46 a.m., the deputy  called ECD-911 again. This 
time, he reported that a car had hit a “rock embankment” and flipped down the mountain. 
The driver of that car was Steven Lawson. He was trapped inside the vehicle for eleven 
hours and died before help arrived.  

hortly after 1:46 a.m., the deputy told the dispatcher that a second vehicle had also 
rolled down the mountain. At that time, the deputy advised ECD-911 that he would ask 
neighboring  Hancock  County  to  “block  the  road  off.”  The  EMA  director,  whom  the 
dispatcher had called earlier that morning, did not arrive at the scene until 3:07 a.m.  

r. Lawson’s surviving spouse, Penny Lawson, on her own behalf and on behalf of 
Mr. Lawson’s surviving child, Corey Lawson, brought this wrongful-death action against 

                                              

2 In reviewing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, we accept as true all factual allegations by 

the non-moving party. King v. Betts, 354 S.W.3d 691, 709 (Tenn. 2011).

Hawkins County, ECD-911, and EMA in Hawkins County Circuit Court.3 She alleged that 
“grossly negligent and reckless conduct” by these parties and their employees caused Mr. 
Lawson’s  death.  All  three  defendants  moved  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings.  ECD-911 
argued that the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act, Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-20-201 
(2012  &  Supp.  2013)  (“the  Act”  or  “GTLA”),  provided  immunity  from  suit  for  claims 
based on recklessness. Hawkins County and EMA similarly argued that they were immune 
under  the  Act  from  claims  based  on  non-negligent  conduct.  And  all  three  defendants 
invoked the public-duty doctrine as an additional basis for immunity.  

he trial court granted the motions and dismissed the case with prejudice. The court 
concluded that the Act gave defendants immunity from claims alleging recklessness and 
that the public-duty doctrine independently barred any claims based on negligence.  

he Court of Appeals reversed. See Lawson v. Hawkins Cnty., No. E2020-01529-
COA-R3-CV,  2021  WL  2949511  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  July  14,  2021),  perm.  app.  granted 
(Tenn. Nov. 17, 2021). First, it held that the Act did not provide immunity for claims based 
on gross negligence or recklessness. The court reasoned that “negligence is a subspecies 
of”  gross  negligence  and  recklessness,  and  immunity  from  claims  based  on  those 
“heightened  forms  of  negligence”  is  therefore  removed  by  Tennessee  Code  Annotated 
section 29-20-205, id.  at *10, which lifts immunity for “injury  proximately caused by  a 
negligent act or omission of any employee within the scope of his employment,” id. at *5 
(quoting  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  § 29-20-205).  Next,  the  court  concluded  that  plaintiff’s 
complaint alleged sufficient facts to state claims for recklessness and gross negligence. Id. 
at *11. Finally, it held that the public-duty doctrine did not bar plaintiff’s suit because her 
allegations of “recklessness and gross negligence” were sufficient at the judgment-on-the-
pleadings  stage  to  trigger  an  exception  to  the  doctrine  for  claims  involving  reckless 
misconduct. Id. at *12.  

e granted defendants’ application for permission to appeal. That application raised 
three issues. The first issue—and the only one we decide in this opinion—is whether the 
Court  of  Appeals  erred  by  holding  that  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  29-20-205 
allows  a  plaintiff  to  sue  a  governmental  entity  for  employee  conduct  that  exceeds  mere 
negligence.4  
                                              

3  Plaintiff  also  sued  several  individual  defendants  in  their  official  capacities.  The  trial  court 

dismissed those claims for redundancy, and plaintiff did not challenge those dismissals on appeal.  

  Defendants’  Rule  11  application  also  sought  review  of  the  Court  of  Appeals’  ruling  that  the 
public-duty doctrine did not bar plaintiff’s claims alleging gross negligence and recklessness. Because we 
conclude that the Act does not remove immunity for claims alleging gross negligence or recklessness, we 
need not reach that issue. We also decline to reach plaintiff’s arguments that the complaint sufficiently 
alleges ordinary “negligence . . . on the part of each governmental employer in addition to the reckless and 
grossly negligent actions of their employees,” and that two other statutory provisions—Tennessee Code 
Annotated sections 7-86-320 and 29-20-108—remove immunity for certain claims against ECD-911. The 
Court of Appeals may consider those arguments in the first instance, including whether plaintiff sufficiently 
preserved and presented the arguments below and whether the public-duty doctrine independently bars any 
claims that may proceed under applicable statutory law.

e  review  de  novo  a  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings.  Mortg.  Elec. 
Registration Sys., Inc. v. Ditto, 488 S.W.3d 265, 275 (Tenn. 2015); see also Tenn. R. Civ. 
P.  12.03.  We  accept  all  the  non-moving  party’s  factual  allegations  as  true  and  draw  all 
reasonable inferences in that party’s favor. King, 354 S.W.3d at 709. A judgment on the 
pleadings for a defendant should be affirmed when the plaintiff “can prove no set of facts” 
in support of a claim entitling her to relief. Young v. Barrow, 130 S.W.3d 59, 63 (Tenn. 
2003); see also McClenahan v. Cooley, 806 S.W.2d 767, 769 (Tenn. 1991) (stating that, 
under these circumstances, the issue is whether “the Plaintiff’s complaint states a cause of 
action that a jury should have been entitled to decide”). 

e also review de novo questions of statutory interpretation like the one presented 
here. See State v. Marshall, 319 S.W.3d 558, 561 (Tenn. 2010). In interpreting statutory 
provisions, our role is to determine how a reasonable reader would have understood the 
text at the time it was enacted. State v. Deberry, 651 S.W.3d 918, 924 (Tenn. 2022). We 
undertake that task by considering the statutory text “in light of ‘well-established canons 
of  statutory  construction.’”  Id.  (quoting  State  v.  Sherman,  266  S.W.3d  395,  401  (Tenn. 
2008)). 

e give terms their natural and ordinary meaning in their statutory context unless 
the  statute  defines  them.  Mills  v.  Fulmarque,  Inc.,  360  S.W.3d  362,  368  (Tenn.  2012). 
When  a  statute  uses  a  common-law  term  without  defining  it,  we  assume  the  enacting 
legislature adopted the term’s common-law meaning “unless a different sense is apparent 
from the context, or from the general purpose of the statute.” In re Estate of Starkey, 556 
S.W.3d 811, 817 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2018) (quoting Lively v. Am. Zinc Co. of Tenn., 191 S.W. 
975, 978 (Tenn. 1917)). Statutes “in derogation of the common law,” moreover, must be 
“strictly construed and confined to their express terms.” Moreno v. City of Clarksville, 479 
S.W.3d 795, 809 (Tenn. 2015) (quoting Doyle v. Frost, 49 S.W.3d 853, 858 (Tenn. 2001)). 
 
III. 

he  question  before  us  is  whether,  as  the  Court  of  Appeals  held,  the  Tennessee 
Governmental  Tort  Liability  Act  lifts  immunity  for  grossly  negligent  and  reckless 
employee actions, in addition to merely negligent ones. We begin our analysis with some 
background about common-law governmental immunity and the Act. We then examine the 
relevant statutory text—Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-20-205—and conclude that 
it removes immunity only for ordinary negligence, not gross negligence or recklessness. 

t common law, the State and its political subdivisions were generally immune from 
suit  under  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity.  Hughes  v.  Metro.  Gov’t  of  Nashville  & 
Davidson Cnty., 340 S.W.3d 352, 360–61 (Tenn. 2011). This “doctrine has been a part of 
Tennessee jurisprudence for well over one hundred  years.” Id. at 360. It has its roots in

feudal England, where “the King . . . was answerable to no court.” Moreno, 479 S.W.3d at 
809 (quoting Hawks v. City of Westmoreland, 960 S.W.2d 10, 14 (Tenn. 1997)). 

et sovereign immunity does not bar suit when the government has “specifically 
consent[ed]”  to  be  sued.  Hughes,  340  S.W.3d  at  360.  Our  Constitution  empowers  the 
legislature to “waive the protections of sovereign immunity,” id., by providing that “[s]uits 
may be brought against the State in such manner and in such courts as the Legislature may 
by law direct,” Tenn. Const. art. I, § 17.  

n 1973, our General Assembly exercised this authority by passing the Act. Hughes, 
340 S.W.3d at 360. The Act reiterated the general rule of sovereign immunity. See Tenn. 
Code  Ann.  § 29-20-201.  But  it  also  removed  the  immunity  of  the  State’s  political 
subdivisions “in limited and enumerated instances for certain injuries.” Hawks, 960 S.W.2d 
at  14.  In  particular,  the  Act  lifted  immunity  for  “injur[ies]  proximately  caused  by  a 
negligent act or omission of any employee within the scope of his  employment.” Tenn. 
Code  Ann.  §  29-20-205  (2012);  see  also  id.  § 29-20-310(a)  (2012  &  Supp.  2013) 
(providing that a court “must first determine that the employee’s . . . acts were negligent” 
before “holding a governmental entity liable for damages”).  

hat  removal  of  immunity  is  subject  to  certain  exceptions.  If  the  injury  at  issue 
“arises  out  of”  one  of  the  acts  specified  in  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section 29-20-
205(1)–(9), then immunity still holds. Id. § 29-20-205; see also Limbaugh v. Coffee Med. 
Ctr., 59 S.W.3d 73, 84 (Tenn. 2001). Those enumerated acts include, among other things, 
discretionary decisions and some intentional torts. Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-20-205(1)–(9).5 

ecause governmental immunity is narrower under the Act than under the common 
law, the Act is “in derogation of the common law” and  must be “strictly construed and 
confined to [its] express terms.” Moreno, 479 S.W.3d at 809 (quoting Doyle, 49 S.W.3d at 
858);  see  also  Hughes,  340  S.W.3d  at  361  (“[S]tatutes  which  waive  immunity  of  the 
[governmental  entity]  from  suit  are  to  be  construed  strictly  in  favor  of  the  sovereign.” 
(quoting  McMahon  v.  United  States,  342  U.S.  25,  27  (1951))).  The  Act  “expressly 
incorporate[s]”  this  rule  of  strict  construction.  Ezell  v.  Cockrell,  902  S.W.2d  394,  399 
(Tenn. 1995). It provides that “[w]hen immunity is removed by this chapter any claim for 
damages must be brought in strict compliance with the terms of this chapter.” Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 29-20-201(c).  

ven when the Act removes immunity, governmental entities still may be immune 
under  the  public-duty  doctrine.  We  previously  held  that  the  Act  did  not  abolish  that 
common-law  doctrine,  which  shields  governmental  entities  and  their  employees  from 
“suits for injuries that are caused by the public employee’s breach of a duty owed to the 
                                              

5  In  2020,  the  legislature  enacted  an  additional  exception  for  certain  injuries  arising  from  the 
COVID-19 pandemic. See Tennessee COVID-19 Recovery Act, ch. 1, § 2, 2020 (2nd Ex. Sess.) Tenn. Pub. 
Acts 1, 1. That exception, which we discuss later in this opinion, was codified as Tennessee Code Annotated 
section 29-20-205(10). It was repealed on July 1, 2022, but remains in effect for some injuries occurring 
before that date. See id. § 7(b), 2020 (2nd Ex. Sess.) Tenn. Pub. Acts at 4.

public  at  large.”  Ezell,  902  S.W.2d  at  397,  400–01.  But  the  public-duty  doctrine  has 
exceptions too, including one known as the special-duty exception. That exception applies 
in three circumstances, including, as relevant here, when “the plaintiff alleges a cause of 
action involving intent, malice, or reckless misconduct.” Id. at 402. 

hen we consider whether a governmental entity is immune from suit, the threshold 
question is whether immunity has been removed under the Act. We need not consider the 
public-duty  doctrine  or  its  exceptions  unless  we  first  conclude  that  the  Act  waives 
immunity. See Chase v. City of Memphis, 971 S.W.2d 380, 385 (Tenn. 1998). 

B. 

i. 

s  explained,  the  Act  waives  immunity  for  “injury  proximately  caused  by  a 
negligent act or omission of any employee within the scope of his  employment.” Tenn. 
Code  Ann.  § 29-20-205.  The  question  before  us  is  whether  the  term  “negligent”  in  this 
provision encompasses gross negligence or recklessness. 

he  term  “negligent”  is  a  common-law  term  that  the  Act  does  not  define.  We 
therefore interpret that term by looking to its common-law meaning. See In re Estate of 
Starkey, 556 S.W.3d at 817. At the time of the Act’s passage in 1973, Tennessee courts 
distinguished between the terms “negligence,” on one hand, and “gross negligence” and 
“recklessness,”  on  the  other,  and  used  those  terms  in  distinct  senses.  That  distinction 
persists today. 

his Court has long defined negligence as the “want of ordinary care.” Inter-City 
Trucking Co. v. Daniels, 178 S.W.2d 756, 757 (Tenn. 1944) (quoting Craig v. Stagner, 19 
S.W.2d 234, 236 (Tenn. 1929), abrogated on other grounds by McIntyre v. Balentine, 833 
S.W.2d 52, 54 (Tenn. 1992)). To prove negligence, a plaintiff must establish “(1) a duty of 
care  owed  by  the  defendant  to  the  plaintiff;  (2)  a  breach  of  that  duty;  and  (3)  a  causal 
relation between the injury to the plaintiff and the defendant’s breach of his duty of care.” 
Shouse v. Otis, 448 S.W.2d 673, 676 (Tenn. 1969); see also McClenahan, 806 S.W.2d at 
774  (specifying  that  a  plaintiff  must  prove  “an  injury  or  loss,”  “causation  in  fact,”  and 
“proximate,  or  legal,  cause”).  Negligence  does  not  require  proof  that  the  defendant 
intended to harm the plaintiff or of any other mental state. To the contrary, this Court has 
explained  that  “[w]illfulness  and  negligence  are  the  opposite  of  each  other;  the  former 
signifying the presence of intention, and the latter its absence.” Memphis St. Ry. Co. v. Roe, 
102 S.W. 343, 346 (Tenn. 1907) (quoting Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chi. & St. Louis Ry. Co. 
v. Miller, 49  N.E. 445, 449 (Ind. 1898)), abrogated on other grounds by McIntyre, 833 
S.W.2d at 54. 

ecklessness, by contrast, does require proof of the defendant’s subjective state of 
mind. We have explained that “recklessness contains an awareness component similar to 
intentional conduct which is not demanded of negligence.” Doe 1 ex rel. Doe 1 v. Roman

Cath. Diocese of Nashville, 154 S.W.3d 22, 38 (Tenn. 2005). Specifically, the defendant 
must “be aware of, but consciously . . . disregard, a substantial and unjustifiable risk.” Id. 
at 39; see also Hodges v. S.C. Toof & Co., 833 S.W.2d 896, 901 (Tenn. 1992) (same). This 
requirement “imposes a significantly higher burden than is required for mere negligence 
actions.” Doe 1, 154 S.W.3d at 39. The “recklessness analysis” is therefore “something 
unique  which  differs  from”  an  “analys[i]s  based  strictly  on  . . . negligence.”  Id.  at  38. 
Tennessee  courts  had  recognized  this  distinction  between  negligence  and  recklessness 
before the Act was adopted. See, e.g., Wells v. S. Ry. Co., 1 Tenn. App. 691, 700 (Tenn. 
Ct.  App.  1926)  (distinguishing  negligence  from  “recklessness  or  wantonness”  and 
explaining  that  the  latter  indicate  a  “willingness  to  inflict  the  impending  injury,  or 
willfulness  in  pursuing  a  course  of  conduct  which  will  naturally  or  probably  result  in 
disaster”). 

ross negligence likewise requires proof of the defendant’s subjective mental state. 
See, e.g., Olsen v. Robinson, 496 S.W.2d 462, 463 (Tenn. 1973) (requiring proof of “willful 
or wanton misconduct” to prove gross negligence and distinguishing such conduct from 
“ordinary  negligence”),  abrogated  on  other  grounds  by  Hudson  v.  Gaitan,  675  S.W.2d 
699, 703 (Tenn. 1984); see also Craig, 19 S.W.2d at 236 (defining “gross negligence” as 
“[s]uch entire  want of care as would raise a  presumption of a conscious indifference to 
consequences”). As we put it in Craig, gross negligence requires “more than . . . want of 
ordinary  care—a  common  definition  of  negligence.”  19  S.W.2d  at  236.  The  required 
“mental  attitude”  is  instead  “one  of  indifference  to  injurious  consequences,  conscious 
recklessness of the rights of others.” Id.  

his distinction between gross negligence and negligence led Tennessee courts to 
attach  different  legal  consequences  to  grossly  negligent  behavior.  Before  adopting  a 
comparative-fault system, we disallowed contributory negligence as a defense to grossly 
negligent conduct, “unless the contributory negligence [was] also gross or wanton.” Stinson 
v. Daniel, 414 S.W.2d 7, 10 (Tenn. 1967); Ellithorpe v. Ford Motor Co., 503 S.W.2d 516, 
521–22  (Tenn.  1973)  (similar),  abrogated  by  McIntyre,  833  S.W.2d  at  54.  Punitive  or 
exemplary  damages  are  permissible  in  a  negligence  action  only  if  the  negligence  is  “so 
gross and wanton as to ‘raise a presumption of conscious indifference to consequences.’” 
Se. Aviation, Inc. v. Hurd, 355 S.W.2d 436, 447 (Tenn. 1962) (quoting Inter-City Trucking 
Co., 178 S.W.2d at 757). And under our former premises-liability rules, we dismissed a 
complaint  that  “allege[d]  no  more  than  ordinary  negligence  on  the  [defendant’s]  part” 
because  the  defendant  host  owed  the  plaintiff  guest  “no  duty  except  to  refrain  from 
willfully injuring him or from committing negligence so gross as to amount to willfulness.” 
Olsen, 496 S.W.2d at 463.6 These cases underscore that, under Tennessee’s common law, 
negligence and gross negligence are distinct concepts.

Plaintiff,  meanwhile,  points  us  to  no  precedent  using  the  term  “negligence”  to 
encompass  grossly  negligent  or  reckless  conduct.  Amicus  curiae,  the  Tennessee  Trial 
Lawyers’ Association, cites Anderson v. Westfield Group, 259 S.W.3d 690 (Tenn. 2008), 
to  support  its  argument  that  the  Act  removes  immunity  for  recklessness.  But  that  case 
involved a very different question from the one presented here. In Anderson, we considered 
whether  “acting  in  a  ‘rash’  manner  within  the  meaning  of  [a  workers’  compensation 
precedent]  necessarily  exclude[d]  negligent  conduct  by  the  employee.”  Id.  at  698.  In 
holding  that  it  did  not,  we  explained  that  “rash”  conduct  includes  conduct  that  is 
“unadvised, 
reckless, 
improvident, 
unnecessarily  dangerous,  impulsive,  [or]  stupid”  or  that  demonstrates  a  “disregard  for 
consequences”  or  that  “imprudently  involv[es]  or  incur[s]  risk.”  Id.  (internal  quotation 
marks and footnotes omitted). Because “negligence”—the “failure to exercise reasonable 
care  under  the  circumstances”—is  “synonymous”  with  these  “descriptions  of  rash,”  we 
held that “conduct which may be characterized as rash . . . includes negligent conduct” in 
addition  to  “reckless  conduct  and  intentional  conduct.”  Id.  (footnotes  omitted).  In  other 
words, we held only that the meaning of “rash” was broad enough to include intentional 
torts, 
recklessness  are 
indistinguishable.

micus curiae also cites a South Carolina case—Berberich v. Jack, 709 S.E.2d 607 
(S.C. 2011). But Berberich actually supports defendants’ position. In that case, the South 
Carolina Supreme Court held that “comparative negligence encompasses the comparison 
of  ordinary  negligence  with  heightened  forms  of  misconduct  such  as  recklessness, 
willfulness, and  wantonness.” Id. at 614. Significantly,  though, the  court did  not equate 
negligence with recklessness or even negligence with gross negligence. It instead stated, 
consistent  with  our  reasoning,  that  willful  or  wanton  negligence  is  “synonymous  with” 
recklessness and that when “negligence [is] so gross as to amount to recklessness, . . . it 
ceases to be mere negligence and assumes very much the nature of willfulness.” Id. at 612 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Jeffers v. Hardeman, 99 S.E.2d 402, 404 (S.C. 
1957)). The court also observed that “‘negligence’ in its broadest  sense is often said to 
encompass  [recklessness,  willfulness,  and  wantonness].”  Id.  at  613  (emphasis  added) 
(quoting Stockman v. Marlowe, 247 S.E.2d 340, 342 (S.C. 1978)). But that statement is no 
help to plaintiff: Here, we are concerned with the meaning of negligence in its narrowest 
sense because we are required to strictly construe the Act’s removal of immunity. 

n  sum,  Tennessee  courts  have  consistently  defined  gross  negligence  and 
recklessness  in  a  manner  distinct  from  ordinary  negligence.  The  term  “negligence”  in 
section  -205  is  therefore  best  understood  to  mean  only  ordinary  negligence,  not  gross 
negligence or recklessness. If there were any doubt on this point, the strict-construction 
rule  that  applies  here  would  require  us  to  resolve  that  doubt  in  favor  of  governmental 
immunity. “[C]onfined to [its] express terms,” Moreno, 479 S.W.3d at 809, section -205 
waives immunity only for employee acts that constitute ordinary negligence.

xamination of section -205’s statutory context reinforces this conclusion.  When 
interpreting a statute, we generally presume that when the legislature uses one term in one 
part of a statute, and a different term elsewhere in the same or a related statute, those terms 
mean  different  things.  See  Griffitts  v.  Humphrey,  288  S.W.2d  1,  3–4  (Tenn.  1955) 
(concluding  that  the  words  “injury”  and  “accident”  had  different  meanings  in  related 
provisions of a workers’ compensation statute); Wis. Cent. Ltd. v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 
2067, 2071 (2018) (giving different meanings to two terms—“money remuneration” and 
“all remuneration”—used in companion statutes). That canon of construction is relevant 
here because, while the General Assembly used the term “negligent” in the part of section 
-205 that we are interpreting, it used the term “gross negligence” in another subsection of 
section -205 and a related statutory provision. 

n 2020, the General Assembly amended section -205 to except from the general 
waiver of immunity injuries “arising from COVID-19” unless a claimant proved that “gross 
negligence” caused the harm. Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-20-205(10) (Supp. 2021). The General 
Assembly’s  use  of  both  “negligent”  and  “gross  negligence”  in  the  very  same  section 
suggests that it understood the difference in meaning between those two terms and used 
them intentionally. See Griffitts, 288 S.W.2d at 4; Wis. Cent. Ltd., 138 S. Ct. at 2072.7 

he  General  Assembly  also  used  the  term  “gross  negligence”  in  a  later-enacted 
provision  in  the  same  chapter—Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  29-20-108.  That 
section  grants  immunity  to  certain  entities  and  individuals  that  provide  emergency 
communication  services  “except  in  cases  of  gross  negligence”  or  “gross  negligence  or 
willful misconduct.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-20-108(a)–(c), (e) (Supp. 2022).8 Once again, 
the General Assembly’s decision to use “gross negligence” instead of simply “negligence” 
suggests that it did not view the terms as synonyms.  

                                              

7 As explained, subsection -205(10) was a later-in-time amendment to section -205 that was later 
repealed. See supra note 5. The presumption discussed above is strongest when two provisions are enacted 
at the same time. See Antonin Scalia & Bryan Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 173 
(2012). But we also presume that the General Assembly “has knowledge of its prior enactments,” especially 
a law it is amending. State v. L.W., 350 S.W.3d 911, 918 (Tenn. 2011). 

 More specifically, section -108 immunizes emergency communications district boards and their 
members “except in cases of gross negligence,” Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-20-108(a); extends such immunity 
to emergency district employees and local governmental 911 communicators or dispatchers, assuming they 
maintain certain training requirements, id. § 29-20-108(b); immunizes emergency call takers and public 
safety dispatchers related to CPR instruction via telephone “except in cases of gross negligence or willful 
misconduct,” id. § 29-20-108(c); and immunizes the emergency district and local government from civil 
damages and suit “for employees who answer 911 emergency calls and employees who are recently hired, 
except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct,” id. § 29-20-108(e).

he  Act  removes  immunity  only  for  “negligent”  employee  acts.  Common-law 
precedent and statutory context make clear that the term “negligent” in section -205 means 
ordinary negligence, not gross negligence or recklessness. The Court of Appeals erred by 
holding otherwise. 
 

C. 

he  Court  of  Appeals’  contrary  decision  relied  heavily  on  Brown  v.  Hamilton 
County, 126 S.W.3d 43 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003). Brown arose from a murder committed by 
a criminal defendant who was on house arrest. Id. at 46. The plaintiff, suing on behalf of 
the murder victim, alleged that Hamilton County was responsible for the murder because 
one  of  its  employees  had  inadequately  supervised  the  defendant.  Id.  at  46–47.  The  trial 
court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims as barred by the public-duty doctrine. Id. at 46. The 
Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the record established “extreme dereliction by the 
County  in  the  operation  of  its  program”  and  thus  “support[ed]  findings  of  reckless 
misconduct and omissions sufficient to come within the exception to the public duty rule.” 
Id. at 50. The court then considered “whether the plaintiff ha[d] shown the elements of a 
negligence claim under the GTLA.” Id. Pointing largely to the same evidence considered 
in its recklessness analysis, the court held that the plaintiff had established negligence. Id. 
at 50–51. 

he Court of Appeals read Brown to “stand[] for the proposition that a plaintiff’s 
claims based upon reckless conduct  may proceed under the GTLA.” Lawson, 2021  WL 
2949511, at *10. Brown’s analysis is not a model of clarity. But we read it as holding only 
that there was reckless conduct sufficient to satisfy the special-duty exception to the public-
duty doctrine. See id. As discussed above, whether the special-duty exception applies under 
the public-duty doctrine is secondary to the threshold inquiry whether immunity is removed 
under the Act. See Chase, 971 S.W.2d at 385. To the extent Brown addressed the Act, it 
held only that the plaintiff had established “the elements of a negligence claim under the 
GTLA.” 126 S.W.3d at 46, 50. Brown thus provides no support for plaintiff’s interpretation 
of the Act. To the extent Brown can be read as holding that the Act waives immunity for 
reckless or grossly negligent employee acts, we reject that holding as inconsistent with the 
statutory text. 

he Court of Appeals’ other reasons for interpreting “negligent” to include gross 
negligence and recklessness do not convince us either. While the court acknowledged that 
simple  negligence  is  “conceptually  distinct”  from  gross  negligence  and  recklessness,  it 
nevertheless  concluded  that  the  term  “negligent”  should  be  construed  to  include 
recklessness and gross negligence because all three terms are “related,” and the Act “d[id] 
not exclude claims based on heightened forms of negligence.” Lawson, 2021 WL 2949511, 
at *10. This analysis ignores that we are required to strictly construe the Act’s waiver of 
immunity and “confine[]” it to its “express terms.” Moreno, 479 S.W.3d at 809 (quoting 
Doyle,  49  S.W.3d  at  858);  see  also  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  29-20-201(c).  Interpreting

“negligent”  to  include  related  but  conceptually  distinct  terms  unless  the  legislature  has 
specifically excluded those terms would turn the strict-construction rule on its head.  

he Court of Appeals  also reasoned that construing the Act to remove immunity 
only  for  ordinary  negligence  would  “perversely  incentivize  [the]  government,  should  it 
commit a negligent act, to commit worse forms of negligence” to avoid liability. Lawson, 
2021  WL  2949511,  at  *10.  This  concern  is  misplaced:  It  overlooks  that  governmental 
employees, unlike the government itself, are not necessarily immune from tort liability. At 
common  law,  governmental  employees  could  be  “personally  liable  for  their  torts”  even 
when acting within the scope of their employment. Johnson v. Smith, 621 S.W.2d 570, 571 
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1981)  (citing  City  of  Memphis  v.  Bettis,  512  S.W.2d  270,  274  (Tenn. 
1974)). Although the Act “immunizes a governmental employee when the governmental 
entity is liable[,] . . . the immunity afforded governmental entities does not extend to the 
employee.” Hughes, 340 S.W.3d at 359 n.3 (citing Fann v. City of Fairview, 905 S.W.2d 
167,  174  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1994)  (rejecting  municipal  employees’  argument  that  the  Act 
granted them the same immunity as their employer)); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-20-
310(b)  (providing,  subject  to  exceptions,  that  “[n]o  claim  may  be  brought  against  an 
employee  . . . for  which  the  immunity  of  the  governmental  entity  is  removed  by  this 
chapter”); id. § 29-20-310(c) (providing that an employee whose governmental employer 
is immune is generally not liable “in excess of the amounts established for governmental 
entities”). 

he upshot is that a plaintiff may seek to hold employees personally liable when 
their governmental employer is immune, at least insofar as the public-duty doctrine or other 
applicable law would not independently bar the suit. See Hughes, 340 S.W.3d at 371–72; 
Harp v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, No. M2012-02047-COA-R3-CV, 2014 WL 265713, at 
*3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2014); see also Marlie Ford v. City of Goodlettsville, No. 19-
c-1707, at 3 (Tenn. Cir. Ct. Feb. 18, 2020) (holding city immune under the Act but allowing 
recklessness  claim  to  proceed  against  city  officers  under  special-duty  exception  to  the 
public-duty  doctrine).9  Interpreting  the  Act  to  preserve  governmental  immunity  for 
employee actions exceeding ordinary negligence therefore does not leave plaintiffs without 
recourse.  It  simply  means  that  plaintiffs  may  seek  relief  from  a  governmental  entity’s 
employees instead of the government itself.  

o be sure, a plaintiff may prefer to sue the government rather than its employees 
given that the government will often have deeper pockets. But the potential availability of 

                                              

9 Tennessee is not the only State to allow suit against a governmental employee when the municipal 
employer is immune. See, e.g., City of Hartford v. Edwards, 946 F.3d 631, 634 (2d Cir. 2020) (holding that 
city was not liable under Connecticut law for damages awarded against employee defendant arising from 
employee’s “willful or wanton” conduct); Ex parte City of Tuskeegee, 932 So. 2d 895, 910–11 (Ala. 2005) 
(holding claims based on municipal employees’ negligence could proceed against municipality but claims 
based on employees’ bad faith or malicious acts could proceed only against employees); see also Dan B. 
Dobbs  et  al.,  Dobbs’  Law  of  Torts  §  343  (2d  ed.  July  2022  Update)  (noting  that  in  some  States,  “the 
employee may be exposed to liability when the municipality is not”).

a suit against a governmental entity’s employee undercuts the Court of Appeals’ conclusion 
that the General Assembly could not have “intended to remove governmental immunity for 
simple  negligence,  but  preserve  governmental  immunity  for  recklessness  or  gross 
negligence.” Lawson, 2021 WL 2949511, at *10. Especially against the Act’s common-law 
backdrop,  it  was  hardly  unreasonable  for  the  General  Assembly  to  bar  claims  against 
governmental  entities  for  gross  negligence,  recklessness,  and  intentional  acts  while 
allowing certain of those claims to proceed against the entities’ employees.10                        
 

D. 

i. 

laintiff  raises  several  additional  arguments  in  defense  of  the  Court  of  Appeals’ 

interpretation. 
 

irst, plaintiff contends that restricting the Act’s waiver of immunity in section -205 
to acts of ordinary negligence would bring it into conflict with Tennessee Code Annotated 
sections 29-20-108 and 7-86-320(d)(1). As discussed above, section 29-20-108 generally 
immunizes  emergency  communications  district  boards,  their  members,  their  employees, 
and certain local governmental employees from claims arising from their work, “except in 
cases of gross negligence.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-20-108(a)–(b). Section 7-86-320(d)(1), 
for its part, immunizes emergency communications districts from claims arising from their 
employees’  processing  of  emergency  calls,  except  claims  based  on  “recklessness  or 
intentional misconduct.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 7-86-320(d)(1) (2015). Plaintiff contends that 
construing section -205 to waive immunity only for ordinary negligence would prevent or 
be inconsistent with removal of immunity under sections 29-20-108 and 7-86-320(d)(1) 
for gross negligence and willful misconduct.  

ut  application  of  a  well-settled  canon  of  statutory  construction  resolves  any 
contradiction  between  these  provisions:  “[W]here  a  conflict  is  presented  between  two 
statutes,  a  more  specific  statutory  provision  takes  precedence  over  a  more  general 
provision.” Coffman v. Armstrong Int’l, Inc., 615 S.W.3d 888, 894 (Tenn. 2021) (alteration 
in original) (quoting State v. Frazier, 558 S.W.3d 145, 153 (Tenn. 2018)). Applying this 
                                              

10 Tennessee also is not the only State to bar governmental liability—or lift employee immunity—
for “wanton” employee acts. See Myers v. Hartford, 853 A.2d 621, 625 (Conn. App. Ct. 2004) (noting that 
Connecticut municipalities have a statutory duty to indemnify their employees for injuries caused by certain 
on-the-job acts, except “willful or wanton” acts), cert. denied, 859 A.2d 582 (Conn. 2004); Fla. Stat. Ann. 
§ 768.28(9)(a) (2011 & Supp. 2022) (immunizing the State and its subdivisions from liability for tortious 
employee acts that “exhibit[] wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property”); Ohio Rev. 
Code  Ann.  § 2744.03(6)(b)  (2019)  (immunizing  a  municipal  employee  from  tort  liability  unless  the 
employee acted “in a wanton or reckless manner”); cf. Pleasant v. Johnson, 325 S.E.2d 244, 248–49 (N.C. 
1985)  (noting  that  “wanton  and  reckless  behavior  may  be  equated  with  an  intentional  act  for  certain 
purposes”  and  reasoning  that  removing  co-employee  immunity  from  suit  for  wanton  behavior,  as  for 
intentional torts, in the workers’ compensation context “places responsibility upon the tortfeasor where it 
belongs”).

canon here, in the event of a conflict, the more specific provisions waiving immunity for 
emergency  communications  district  boards,  their  members,  and  certain  others  would 
govern  in  situations  involving  the  entities,  individuals,  and  circumstances  specified  in 
sections  29-20-108  and  7-86-320(d)(1),  while  section  29-20-205’s  general  waiver  of 
immunity for negligence would continue to govern the immunity of governmental entities 
in other situations.11 Moreover, as ECD-911 acknowledges, section 29-20-108(b)’s gross-
negligence  standard  would  protect  911  dispatchers  and  their  employers  only  where  the 
dispatchers  had  “attain[ed]  and  maintain[ed]”  certain  training  requirements;  otherwise, 
they would be subject to suit for ordinary negligence under section 29-26-205. Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 29-20-108(b). In short, the statutes are complementary, not contradictory. 
 

ii. 

econd, plaintiff argues that it would be strange for the General Assembly to have 
included exceptions from section 29-20-205’s removal of immunity for recklessness and 
intentional  torts  if  the  Act  waives  immunity  only  for  simple  negligence.  This  argument 
misconstrues  both  the  role  of  these  exceptions  and  our  case  law  applying  them.  The 
exceptions  apply  where  a  plaintiff  has  first  established  negligent  supervision  of  an 
employee  acting  within  the  scope  of  employment.  See  Hughes,  340  S.W.3d  at  368–69 
(holding that a plaintiff was required to demonstrate negligent supervision to lift immunity 
under section 29-20-205 based on an employee’s intentional tort); see also Limbaugh, 59 
S.W.3d at 84 (holding that a defendant was not immune under section 29-20-205 where 
“the injury inflicted on [plaintiff] was ‘proximately caused by a negligent act or omission’ 
of  [defendant’s]  supervisory  personnel”  and  where  plaintiff’s  injuries  “arose  out  of” 
intentional torts not excepted by subsection -205(2)). In other words, section 29-20-205 
removes immunity for injuries “proximately caused by a negligent act or omission of any 
employee,” including the negligent supervision of other employees. Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-
20-205.  But  it  creates  exceptions  from  that  removal  of  immunity  where  negligently 
supervised employees committed certain intentional torts and other acts.  

ndeed,  plaintiff  does  not  argue  that,  in  the  absence  of  the  exceptions  for  certain 
enumerated intentional torts, the Act would remove immunity for all intentional torts. To 
do so would require contending that section 29-20-205’s reference to “negligent act[s] or 
omission[s]” includes intentional acts. And our case law clearly has rejected that argument. 
See,  e.g.,  Hughes,  340  S.W.3d  at  368  (“[T]he  GTLA  does  not  allow  plaintiffs  to  hold 
governmental  entities  vicariously  liable  for  intentional  torts  not  exempted  under 
section 29-20-205(2), but rather requires a direct showing [of] negligence on the part of the 
governmental  entity.”  (alteration  in  original)  (quoting  Pendleton  v.  Metro.  Gov’t  of 
Nashville & Davidson Cnty., No. M2004-01910-COA-R3-CV, 2005 WL 2138240, at *3

11 As ECD-911 points out, section 7-86-320(d)(1) appears in a different title and chapter than the 
Act and applies only to “claims for recklessness or intentional misconduct in processing emergency calls.” 
We take no position on whether that provision applies in this case or, if so, whether its application would 
conflict with the Act.

entirely  different  concepts  .  .  .  [and]  are  regarded  as  mutually  exclusive  grounds  for 
liability.”).  It  therefore  makes  little  sense  to  argue  that  section  29-20-205  must  waive 
immunity  for  gross  negligence  and  recklessness  because  certain  grossly  negligent  and 
reckless acts, like the enumerated intentional torts, are excepted from its coverage.  

elatedly, plaintiff argues that the public-duty doctrine’s special-duty exception for 
cases  involving  “intent,  malice,  or  reckless  misconduct”  could  never  apply  if  the  Act 
removes immunity only for negligent employee acts. Not so. The exception would apply 
in at least one situation: when a plaintiff adequately alleges a reckless-misconduct claim 
against an employee. See Ford, No. 19-c-1707, at 3. As explained, the Act does not grant 
immunity  to  governmental  employees.  The  public-duty  doctrine,  however,  applies  to 
governmental entities and employees alike. See Matthews v. Pickett Cnty., 996 S.W.2d 162, 
163 (Tenn. 1999) (noting that the public-duty doctrine “shields public entities and public 
employees from tort liability for injuries caused by a breach of a duty owed to the public 
at  large”).  There  may  be  other  situations  in  which  the  special-duty  exception  would 
continue to apply. For present purposes, the exception’s continued application to claims 
against employees suffices to defeat plaintiff’s argument. 

CONCLUSION 

e hold that section -205’s waiver of immunity for “negligent” acts includes only 
ordinary negligence, not gross negligence or recklessness. We reverse the Court of Appeals 
to  the  extent  it  held  otherwise  and  remand  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this 
opinion. Costs of this appeal are taxed to plaintiff, for which execution may issue.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
