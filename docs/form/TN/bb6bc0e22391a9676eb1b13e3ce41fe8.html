February 7, 2023 Session

ADRIANE ALLEN v. AMERICAN YEAST INC. ET AL.

Appeal from the Circuit Court for Shelby County
No. CT-003101-12 Gina C. Higgins, Judge
___________________________________

No. W2021-00956-COA-R3-CV
___________________________________

In a prior appeal involving this case, this Court vacated the trial court’s decision to require 
the  Appellants herein  to  interplead  funds,  but  we  otherwise  affirmed  the  trial  court’s 
actions, including the dismissal of the underlying case.  Following our remand for further 
proceedings consistent with the appellate opinion, such as the collection of costs, the trial 
court  ruled,  notwithstanding  our  prior  affirmance  of  the  case’s  dismissal,  that  the  case 
“shall be Dismissed With Prejudice” but upon the payment of $300,000.00 into the registry 
of the court.  The trial court further dismissed, without prejudice, a petition to enforce an 
attorney’s  lien  that  plaintiff’s  former attorneys  had  attempted  to  get  the  trial  court  to 
adjudicate in the present litigation.  Because this Court’s prior opinion affirmed the trial 
court’s  previous  dismissal,  thus  ending  the  underlying  case,  we  conclude  that  the  trial 
court’s efforts to condition dismissal of the case on remand was in error.  Regarding the 
petition for enforcement of an attorney’s lien, the issue raised for our review on appeal is 
whether  the  trial  court  should  have  transferred  the  matter  to  another  court  division  as 
opposed  to  dismissing  the  petition  without  prejudice.    For  the  reasons  stated  herein,  we 
discern no error with the trial court’s disposition on that issue.

Affirmed in Part, Reversed in Part, and Remanded

BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

As  we  discussed  when  resolving  a  prior  appeal  of  this  matter,  Allen  v.  American 
Yeast, Inc., No. W2017-00874-COA-R3-CV, 2018 WL 4846364 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 4, 
2018) (“American Yeast I”), this case was commenced by Adriane Allen in an attempt to 
recover from Crystal Stark and American Yeast, Inc. (“American Yeast”), for injuries Ms. 
Allen sustained in a motor vehicle accident involving her and Ms. Stark, an employee of 
American Yeast.  Id. at *1.  Following a  mediation of the dispute, the parties reached a 
post-mediation agreement to settle Ms. Allen’s claims, and the agreement was signed by 
American Yeast’s counsel,1 Ms. Allen’s counsel, and Ms. Allen’s mother, who was acting 
pursuant to a power of attorney given by her daughter.  Id. at *1-2.  Ms. Allen, however, 
later refused to sign a release that was contemplated by the settlement, prompting American 
Yeast to file a motion to enforce the settlement.  Id. at *2.  Although Ms. Allen testified 
during a subsequent hearing on American Yeast’s motion that her mother did not have her 
permission to make decisions for her, and further testified that she had rejected American 
Yeast’s  settlement  offer  at  the  mediation,  the  trial  court  ultimately  determined  that  the 
parties’ agreement was enforceable and noted its expectation that the parties would adhere 
to its terms.  Id.  Ms. Allen, however, continued to refuse to comply, and American Yeast 
filed a petition for civil contempt.  Id.  Ms. Allen’s counsel then filed a motion requesting 
that  the  trial  court  require  the  interpleader  of  $300,000.00  in  settlement  funds, which 
American Yeast opposed.  Id.  Ms. Allen also noted her opposition to the request, filing a 
pro se response contending that her attorney did not have the authority to request relief on 
her behalf because she had fired him the previous calendar year. Id.  The trial court would 
later enter an order on April 4, 2017, denying the contempt petition, granting the motion 
for interpleader, and dismissing Ms. Allen’s case with prejudice.  Id. at *3.

When the interpleader issue, the court’s dismissal order, and the topic of the parties’ 
post-mediation agreement became the focus of our review in American Yeast I, we held 
that  Ms.  Allen  had  “lost  the  ability  to  challenge  the  validity  of  the  post-mediation 
agreement” and that “because the trial court concluded that Ms. Allen and American Yeast 
had an enforceable agreement fully resolving Ms. Allen’s claims . . . the court’s decision 
to dismiss the case with prejudice was proper.”  Id. at *4 (emphasis added).  As for the 
interpleader of funds issue, we agreed with Ms. Allen that the trial court had improperly 
considered  a  motion  filed  by  her  former  attorney,  and  we  therefore  vacated  the  court’s 
decision requiring American Yeast to interplead funds.  Id. at *4-5.  In connection with our 
disposition on the interpleader issue, we specifically stressed that the trial court’s April 4, 
2017, order was affirmed “in all other respects,” including the “dismissal of the case with 
prejudice.”    Id. at  *5.    We  then  remanded  “for  further  proceedings  consistent with  this

therein, “American Yeast” referred collectively to both Ms. Stark and American Yeast, Inc.

opinion.”  Id.  Although Ms. Allen subsequently filed a Rule 11 application for permission 
to appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court denied her application.  Allen v. American Yeast 
Inc., No. W2017-00874-SC-R11-CV (Tenn. Feb. 22, 2019) (order denying application for 
permission to appeal).  The mandate issued on February 27, 2019.

Prior to the issuance of the mandate, in January 2019, attorney Darrell O’Neal, who 
was Ms. Allen’s former counsel, filed a “Petition to Enforce Attorney’s Lien” within the 
context of the same case and trial court docket number that was the subject of review in 
American Yeast I.  American Yeast responded by filing a motion to dismiss and argued, 
among other things, that the court lacked jurisdiction due to an ongoing appellate process 
and that Mr. O’Neal was not entitled to enforce his claim within the same lawsuit.  Further, 
American Yeast contended that Mr. O’Neal’s charging lien did not permit him to recover 
from it, an opposing party.  Rather, American Yeast submitted that Mr. O’Neal’s lien was 
against Ms. Allen.  American Yeast also offered an argument observing that the contract 
relied upon by Mr. O’Neal was between Ms. Allen and another attorney, John Walker, a 
licensed Arkansas attorney.  

Following  the  issuance  of  the  mandate,  Mr.  O’Neal  filed  an  amended  petition  to 
enforce attorney’s lien, and he was joined in the petition by Mr. Walker.  The filing averred 
that, although Ms. Allen had retained Mr. Walker to represent her in her personal injury 
action, her contract with Mr. Walker provided that Mr. Walker could associate with other 
counsel.    The  petition  further  noted  that  Mr.  Walker  had,  in  fact,  associated  with  Mr. 
O’Neal to provide local representation in Memphis and that Ms. Allen had agreed to this 
representation.  

Of note, the amended petition to enforce attorney’s lien acknowledged that pursuant 
to  this  Court’s  ruling  in  American  Yeast  I,  “Ms.  Allen’s  claims  were  dismissed  with 
prejudice.”  In attempting to enforce the attorney’s lien that was the subject of the petition, 
Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker requested in part that the court “require American Yeast to 
pay the required attorney’s fees.”  (emphasis added)  As for American Yeast’s previously-
noted objection to the enforcement of a lien within the same lawsuit, Mr. O’Neal and Mr. 
Walker  alerted  the  trial  court  to  the  existence  of  an  “exception”  to  the  general  rule  that 
American Yeast had highlighted.  Namely, Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker argued that lien 
enforcement could occur in the same action where the property that is the subject of the 
lien came into the control of the court in the case in which services were rendered.  See 
Schmitt v. Smith, 118 S.W.3d 348, 354 (Tenn. 2003) (discussing an exception to the general 
rule that an attorney must commence a separate proceeding to enforce his or her contractual 
right to a fee).

American Yeast did not stray from its position that dismissal of the lien issue was 
warranted.  In a filing submitted after the joint petition from Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker 
was filed, American Yeast argued that the exception discussed in Schmitt did not apply as, 
according to it, there were never any funds within the control of the court.  In support of 
- 3 -

its position, American Yeast relied upon this Court’s decision in Castle v. David Dorris 
Logging,  Inc.,  No.  W2012-00917-COA-R3-CV,  2013  WL  500780  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Feb. 
11, 2013).2

Later, before the lien issue was addressed, Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker requested 
that the trial court “require American Yeast to pay Three Hundred Thousand Dollars . . .  
into  the  registry  of  [the  trial  court],”  noting,  among  other  things,  that  their  request  “is 
designed to protect any funds due Ms. Allen.”  American Yeast objected to this request and 
continued to object to the court’s jurisdiction over the attorney’s lien matter.  Among other 
things,  American  Yeast argued  that  “[t]here  was  no  issue  raised  over  any  potential 
settlement funds, or the payment of those, when the [trial court] made its ruling. Moreover, 
[the  trial  court]  also  subsequently  dismissed  the  underlying  case  under  Rule  41.02  as  a 
sanction for Allen’s continued defiance of [the trial court’s] prior orders to comply with 
the Post Mediation Agreement.”  American Yeast stated that the trial court had previously 
“simply held that the Post Mediation Agreement was a contract that Respondent Adriane 
Allen had to comply with.”  No funds were within the control of the court according to 
American Yeast, and further, it argued that “[a] dismissed case means there is no award or 
judgment and no attorney’s lien to adjudicate.”  Although Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker had 
suggested that “[o]nce funds are paid, there is a dismissal with prejudice,” American Yeast
argued that this position “defies the Court of Appeals’ decision vacating the interpleader . 
. . while the rest of the [trial court’s order] was affirmed.”  

                                           

2 In that case, a jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs in the amount of $350,000.00, but after the 
verdict, the plaintiffs fired their law firm.  Castle, 2013 WL 500780, at *1.  The verdict was reduced to 
judgment, and thereafter, the law firm filed a notice of attorney lien.  Id.  The defendants in the case later 
paid the jury verdict into the court clerk and ceased further participation in the litigation.  Id. at *2 n.3.  The 
law firm then sought to recover its fees in the same proceeding, which the trial court allowed.  Id. at *2-3.  
Although the law firm argued that its efforts in the underlying proceeding fell within the exception under 
the case law  given that the parties had agreed to pay damages into court, id. at *6, this Court disagreed 
when the matter was considered on appeal and observed that “the funds at issue were not within the trial 
court’s control during the underlying litigation.”  Id. at *8.  We explained:

[D]uring the underlying litigation there were no funds at issue because the Defendants had 
not yet been ordered to pay damages to the Appellants until the order on the jury verdict 
was  entered.  In  contrast  in Schmitt, the  property  at  issue  was  within  the  trial  court’s 
jurisdiction from the inception of the underlying litigation because it constituted  marital 
property subject to equitable division pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36–
4–121. Thus, in this case, the funds at issue were not within the control of the trial court 
“during the underlying litigation,” and the trial court therefore, had no jurisdiction to award 
[the law firm] its alleged fee in this case.

Id.  We further stated in Castle that “despite the parties’ apparent consent to allow the trial court to hold the
funds pending resolution of the dispute, the consent order did not operate to confer jurisdiction on the trial
court to consider the fee dispute between the Appellants and [the law firm].”  Id.

During  a  March  19,  2021,  hearing  in  which  Mr.  O’Neal  and  Mr.  Walker’s  lien 
matter was argued, Mr. O’Neal expressed a desire to have the lien issue transferred to a 
different court if the trial court was of the opinion that it should not be considered in the 
present lawsuit. Ultimately, the trial court expressed its agreement with American Yeast’s 
position  that  the  lien  matter  was  not  properly  asserted  in  this  lawsuit,  and  as  discussed 
infra, the lien enforcement petition was later dismissed without prejudice by written order.  
When explaining its position why the lien matter was not properly before it, the trial court 
stated as follows during the March 19, 2021, hearing:

This Court is not in the proper posture to enforce the attorney lien.
  
          In accordance with the arguments that  were posed and raised by the 
Defendant that this Court lacks jurisdiction, well, this Court does agree that 
it lacks jurisdiction to enforce the attorney lien in this matter.  These were 
not funds that were under -- that came into the custody of this Court as a part 
of this litigation while the litigation was ongoing.  Those funds have not come 
in.  They were not -- this Court was up-front and certainly a part of the Castle 
v.  Loggins  case.    I’m  well  aware  of  the  appellate court’s  rulings  and 
determinations as to when we can take jurisdiction over liens.

Mr. O’Neal is going to have to file a separate lawsuit.  That lawsuit 
could wind up around and end up in Division IV.  It might.  It can end up in 
any one of the nine divisions of Circuit Court.  We have no control over that.   

Although  this  Court’s  opinion  in  American  Yeast  I had  affirmed  the  trial  court’s 
prior  dismissal  of  the  underlying  case,  the  trial  court  subsequently  addressed  during  the 
March 19, 2021, hearing what conditions, if complied with prospectively, would allow for 
dismissal:

So the question becomes not based upon Mr. O’Neal’s request to have the 
funds paid in to the Clerk’s Office, but in order to resolve this case, clean it 
up finally, what happens?  And I am going to, in essence, repeat myself.

. . . . 

So the Court orders for final resolution of this matter, based upon the 
agreement of the parties, one more time:  Defendant is to pay the $300,000 
in to the Clerk’s Office.  Upon the payment and receipt of that $300,000 by 
the Clerk, this  matter will be dismissed.  The Court will enter an Order of 
Dismissal of this case.[3]  

                                           

3 This conditioning of the dismissal of the case was also broached by the trial court on remand from 
American Yeast I well before the March 19, 2021, hearing.  For instance, in a prior order, the trial court had 
- 5 -

Following  the  hearing,  on  July  23,  2021,  the  trial  court  entered  its  “Final  Order”  that 
memorialized the rulings discussed above.  In this order, the trial court held in pertinent 
part  that  “[t]he  Defendant  shall  have  30  days  from  the  entry  of  this  order  to  deposit 
[$300,000.00]  into  the  Registry  of  the  Court.    Upon  that  payment,  this  matter  shall  be 
Dismissed  With  Prejudice.”   The  court  ruled that  it  would  stay  the  disbursement  of  any 
funds from the registry until such time that all appeals have been exhausted.4  As for Mr. 
O’Neal and Mr. Walker’s lien enforcement petition, the trial court held that the matter was 
“Dismissed Without Prejudice.”  This appeal followed.

DISCUSSION

          The parties have raised a number of issues for our review.  American Yeast and Ms. 
Stark  (hereinafter  “the  American  Yeast  Appellants”) generally  complain  about  the  trial 
court’s decision to condition dismissal of the underlying case on the payment of funds into 
the  court’s  registry,  “even  though  this  Court had  previously  vacated such  a  requirement 
and affirmed dismissal of the matter with prejudice . . . without conditions.”  They submit
that  the  trial  court’s  actions  violated  the  law  of  the  case  and  ask  that  the  funds  they
deposited into court be disgorged from the registry of the court and returned.  For their part, 
Mr. O’Neal and the Estate of John Walker5 argue that the trial court did not err in its actions 
on  remand,  save  for  their  specific  contention  that,  instead  of  dismissing  the  petition  to 
enforce  the  attorney’s  lien,  the  trial  court  should  have  transferred  that  lien  enforcement 
matter  to  another  court  division.    Proceeding  pro  se,  Ms.  Allen  also  raises  a  number  of 
issues for our review.  In addition to posing procedural questions relating to this appeal, 
she appears to challenge the propriety of the settlement agreement that was entered into 
following mediation.

Ms. Allen’s Issues

          We begin our discussion by briefly considering the concerns raised by Ms. Allen in 
this appeal.  As best as we are able to discern, the heart of Ms. Allen’s challenge on appeal 
appears to relate to the validity of the settlement agreement concerning her claims.  Indeed, 
we  observe  that  she  specifically  describes  her  appeal  as  “involv[ing]  the  legal  right  of 
Appellee/Plaintiff  Adriane Allen  .  .  .  to  legally  reject  Defendants’ settlement  offer.”
Respectfully, all of the various concerns Ms. Allen appears to raise in relation to that end 
were  addressed  in our  prior  decision  in  American  Yeast  I in  which her  challenge  to  the 
settlement  agreement was  specifically  foreclosed.    See  American  Yeast  I,  2018  WL 
4846364, at *4.  We thus turn to the issues raised by the other parties in this appeal.6  
                                           
signaled that the case “will be dismissed” upon the payment of settlement funds into the registry.  

4 According to a notice filed with the trial court, $300,000.00 was paid into the registry on August 

23, 2021.  

5 Mr. Walker is now deceased.
6 We also note, of course, that we find no merit with respect to certain procedural concerns Ms. 
Allen has attempted to interject in this appeal.  For instance, whereas Ms. Allen claims that the brief of the 
- 6 -

Trial Court’s Conditioning of Dismissal on Remand

          The primary issues before us in this appeal are fairly narrow ones, and we limit our 
discussion accordingly. The essential question implicated through the brief submitted by 
the  American  Yeast  Appellants  is  whether,  on  remand  from  American  Yeast  I, the  trial 
court erred in conditioning dismissal of the case upon the payment of funds into court.  The 
American Yeast Appellants contend that such action on the part of the trial court violated 
the  law  of  the  case  doctrine  and  note,  correctly,  that  this  Court  previously  removed  a 
requirement that funds be interpleaded into court and, at the same time, affirmed the trial 
court’s previous dismissal of the case with prejudice.  Id. at *5.

          As this Court has previously discussed  concerning a trial court’s responsibility on 
remand:

After a case has been appealed, a trial court does not reacquire jurisdiction 
over the case until it receives a mandate from the appellate court. Once the 
mandate reinvests the trial court’s jurisdiction over a case, the case stands in 
the same posture it did before the appeal except insofar as the trial court’s 
judgment  has  been  changed  or  modified  by  the  appellate  court. Raht v.
Southern Ry., 215  Tenn.  485,  497,  387  S.W.2d  781,  786  (1965).  The 
appellate  court’s  opinion  becomes  the  law  of  the  case, Gill v. Godwin, 59 
Tenn.App.  582,  786,  442  S.W.2d  661,  662-63(1967),  foreclosing  and 
excluding  any  complaint,  constitutional  or  otherwise,  as  to  the  issues 
v.
addressed  and  decided 
McCullough, 735 S.W.2d 464, 469 (Tenn.Ct.App.1987). Thus, the trial court 
does  not  have  the  authority  to  modify  or  revise  the  appellate  court’s 
opinion, McDade v. McDade, 487 S.W.2d 659, 663 (Tenn.Ct.App.1972), or 
v.
to  expand 
McCullough, 735  S.W.2d  at  470.  The  trial  court’s  sole  responsibility  is  to 
carefully  comply  with  directions  in  the  appellate  court’s  opinion. Raht v.
Southern Ry., 215 Tenn. at 497-98, 387 S.W.2d at 786-87.

accordance  with  technical  procedural  requirements,  we  fail  to  understand  what  prejudice  exists  even 
assuming arguendo that the brief was not served on her properly as she claims.  Indeed, it is clear that Ms. 
Allen  received  the  brief,  as she  has  acknowledged  the  brief  and  its  contents  before  this  Court, and  it  is 
further clear that she was aware of the brief’s contents months before her own amended brief was submitted.  
For instance, in a document Ms. Allen filed regarding a motion to supplement the record, she referenced 
how “Appellants/Defendants cited from the volumes of the Record of Appeal in their filing of their brief.”  
We thus find no merit to her request that we strike the American Yeast Appellants’ brief.  We also find no 
merit  in  Ms.  Allen’s  conclusory  assertion,  which  is  not  supported  by  any  evidence,  that  the  attorneys 
representing the estate of Mr. Walker are doing so fraudulently.

May  14,  2001)  (internal  footnote  omitted). The  law  of  the  case  doctrine  “promotes  the 
finality  and  efficiency  of  the  judicial  process,  avoids  indefinite  relitigation  of  the  same 
issue, fosters consistent results in the same litigation, and assures the obedience of lower 
courts  to  the  decisions  of  appellate  courts.”    Memphis Publ’g Co. v. Tenn. Petroleum
Underground Storage Tank Bd., 975 S.W.2d 303, 306 (Tenn. 1998).

          Here, it is clear to us that the trial court’s action on remand in effect modified this 
Court’s prior opinion from American Yeast I.  As reflected in American Yeast I, this Court 
vacated the trial court’s prior decision requiring the interpleading of funds into the court 
but otherwise affirmed the trial court, including its dismissal of the case with prejudice.  
American Yeast I, 2018 WL 4846364, at *5.  The underlying tort case was thus dismissed; 
the case was over.  That is the posture in which this litigation was remanded.  Yet, even 
though this Court had already affirmed dismissal of the case and removed the requirement 
that funds be interpleaded pursuant to the motion of Mr. O’Neal, who no longer represented 
Ms.  Allen,  the  trial  court  took  further  action  on  remand  to  condition  dismissal  of  the 
already-dismissed case, all occurring amidst the efforts of Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker to 
litigate their attorney’s lien enforcement petition.  Indeed, as we have discussed, the trial 
court ultimately required, following a motion by Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker for funds to 
be deposited into court,7 that the case would be dismissed upon the payment of $300,000.00 
into the court’s registry.

The  trial  court’s  action  on  remand  in  conditioning  dismissal  of  the  case  departed 
from what had already been decided in the case, as it had already been dismissed.  In this 
respect, we agree with the sentiment and understanding expressed by the American Yeast 
Appellants:  “[t]he  case  was  supposed  to  be  over.”    The  underlying  tort  case  was  in  fact 
already over, as we had affirmed its dismissal and had removed the requirement that funds 
be interpleaded in connection thereto.  Because the trial court did not adhere to the law of 
the case, we hereby reverse its order conditioning dismissal of the case upon the payment 
of funds into the court’s registry.  Moreover, based on this disposition, we are in agreement 
with  the  American  Yeast  Appellants  that  funds  they  paid  into  the  court’s  registry  in 
accordance with the complained-of order should be released and returned to them.  The 
ultimate effect is, as in American Yeast I, that Ms. Allen’s tort case is over.

Petition to Enforce Attorney’s Lien

          The last issue for our review concerns the petition to enforce attorney’s lien, which 
was interjected into the context of this litigation following the remand from American Yeast 
I.8  As mentioned earlier, when attempting to enforce the attorney’s lien that was the subject 
                                           

7 Although we recognize that the motion to deposit funds was not nominally filed in the name of 
Ms. Allen, we still observe that, just as Mr. O’Neal was Ms. Allen’s former attorney when the motion for 
interpleader discussed in American Yeast I had been considered, we observe he also was not her counsel at 
this stage.  

8 Technically, as outlined earlier, the initial petition submitted by Mr. O’Neal alone was filed before 

- 8 -

of the petition, Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker requested, among other things, that the trial 
court  “require  American  Yeast to  pay  the  required  attorney’s  fees.”    (emphasis  added)  
Moreover, as we discussed, American Yeast opposed the attempted lien enforcement by, 
in part, directing the trial court to case law such as Castle v. David Dorris Logging, Inc., 
No. W2012-00917-COA-R3-CV, 2013 WL 500780 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2013), which 
indicates  that  fee  disputes  must  ordinarily  be  litigated  in  a  separate  lawsuit  unless  the 
property upon which the lien is to be enforced comes within the control of the court in the 
case in which services were rendered.  See id. at *6-8.  The record reflects that the trial 
court found favor in American Yeast’s argument, with the court dismissing the petition to 
enforce without prejudice.  Notably, Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker’s estate do not appear to 
raise  any  actual  challenge  to  the  trial  court’s  conclusion  that  the  attorney’s  lien  matter 
needed  to  be  asserted  in  a  separate  lawsuit.   Rather,  the  issue  they  raise  concerning  the 
matter is simply that, instead of dismissing the attorney’s lien enforcement petition from 
the present litigation without prejudice, the trial court should have transferred the petition 
to another court division pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 16-1-116.  This 
referenced  statute  allows  a  court  that  determines  it  lacks  jurisdiction  to,  “if  it  is  in  the 
interest of justice, transfer the action . . . to any other such court in which the action . . . 
could have been brought at the time it was originally filed.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-1-116.  
It is within a court’s discretion to determine whether a transfer is warranted.  See Turner v. 
State, 184 S.W.3d 701, 705 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005) (noting that transfer under the statute is 
not automatic but subject to the court’s discretion).

To the extent Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Walker’s estate are asserting that the trial court 
abused its discretion, we fail to discern any abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court 
concerning  this  issue.    The  dismissed  petition  was  dismissed  without  prejudice,  and 
moreover, it is not clear to us why it would have been “in the interest of justice” to transfer 
the petition as filed, considering that the petition named American Yeast (which was not a 
client of Mr. O’Neal or Mr. Walker).  Indeed, even comments made by Mr. O’Neal when 
discussing the transfer issue during a hearing before the trial court point to the real nature 
of the dispute at issue concerning the attorney’s lien: “That’s the transfer statute.  So if this 
petition -- you know, because this is a dispute between a lawyer and her [sic] client; and 
the question is if this Court believes that it shouldn’t be in this courtroom, this Court would 
have  the  jurisdiction  to  transfer  it  to  the  appropriate  courtroom  or  to  another  Court.”  
(emphasis added)  This issue is, respectfully, without merit.  

CONCLUSION

In light of the foregoing discussion, we reject the issues raised by Ms. Allen in this 
appeal, reverse the trial court’s order conditioning dismissal of the case upon the payment 
of funds into the court’s registry, hold that the funds paid into the court’s registry pursuant 

                                           
the mandate issued in American Yeast I, but the amended petition filed on behalf of Mr. O’Neal and Mr. 
Walker was filed after the mandate issued.

to  that  order  should  be  returned  to  the  American  Yeast  Appellants,  and  affirm  the  trial 
court’s  nonprejudicial  dismissal  of  the  attorney’s  lien  enforcement  petition  that  was 
pursued by Mr. O’Neal and the Estate of John Walker.
