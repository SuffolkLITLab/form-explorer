Memorial Resolution 
Jerry Lynn Smith 
1953-2021 

June 2022 

 

Judge Jerry Lynn Smith died on February 12, 2021, leaving behind family, 
friends, and colleagues who miss his wit and his humanity.  He also left behind a 
legacy of lawyers trained by him in criminal law as well as decisions and opinions 
that added to the development of the law in this State. 

Judge Smith was born in 1953 in Etowah, Tennessee, a place he loved for its 
people and its history.  A retired teacher recognized Jerry’s potential and encouraged 
him in his love of books and learning.  At McMinn Central High School, he was 
class  president,  excelling  in  academics,  particularly  history.    An  outstanding 
thespian, he starred as the prosecutor in a gripping courtroom drama, a foretaste of 
things to come.  

He graduated with honors from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and 

then attended the University of Tennessee College of Law, graduating in 1978.  

After law school, Jerry returned to his small-town roots, opening a practice in 
Linden, Tennessee, where he handled everything from boundary disputes to dog bite 
cases and, of course, criminal law.  But Jerry needed a larger stage for his manifest 
abilities than a small town could provide. 

In 1982, he joined the Office of the Tennessee Attorney General in Nashville 
as an Assistant Attorney General.  By 1985, he had risen to Deputy Attorney General 
of the Criminal Justice Division, where he served the State of Tennessee for the next 
ten years, developing a deep knowledge of the criminal justice system. 

As Deputy, he oversaw and managed the attorneys handling criminal appeals 
for the State.  He became the state expert on extradition law and served as President 
of the National Association of Extradition Officials.  He was also a member of the 
Sixth Circuit Task Force on Capital cases.  

Jerry was an active member of the Tennessee Sentencing Commission, which 
rewrote and updated Tennessee sentencing laws.  In that role, he earned the respect 

of the legislative and executive branch members with his knowledge and common 
sense understanding of criminal law and procedure.    

A high point in his career as a practicing attorney was his appearance before 
the United States Supreme Court in 1988, arguing for the State in Houston v. Lack.  
The State lost in a narrow 5-4 decision. 

At  the  Attorney  General’s  Office,  Jerry  was  recognized  for  his  insight  and 
knowledge of the law and of course, his quick wit.  He was a great colleague who 
treasured his time encouraging and coaching younger attorneys. 

A zealous advocate as the State’s lawyer, Jerry nevertheless recognized that 
prosecutors have a duty to seek justice and to fairly treat all persons coming before 
the courts.  He was liked and respected by members of the defense bar, who knew 
he would treat them and their clients fairly and honestly. 

In 1995, Jerry was appointed to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals by 
Governor Don Sundquist, and he continued his service to the people of Tennessee 
in that role for the next 19 years.  He retired in 2014. 

On  the  court,  he  continued  his  commitment  to  fairmindedness  and  his 
dedication  to  the  rule  of  law.    He  authored  hundreds  of  opinions  reflecting  his 
thorough understanding of the criminal justice system and its role in society.  Other 
Court  members  appreciated  his  collegial  approach  and  his  intellectual  curiosity.  
They  also  appreciated  his  ability  to  provide  entertaining  stories  at  lunch, 
conferences, and other gatherings.  Jerry was the force behind the Nashville Supreme 
Court building annual Chili Cookoff, which raised funds that benefited several local 
charities in the middle Tennessee area.  

While serving on the bench, Judge Smith taught Criminal Law at the Nashville 
School of Law for fourteen years.  His love of teaching inspired him to organize the 
first Court of Criminal Appeals session to be held at the Nashville School of Law.  
He was a member of both the Harry Phillips Inn of Court and the Belmont Inn of 
Court, enabling him to further mentor aspiring lawyers.   

These professional accomplishments in no way define the whole of Jerry Lynn 
Smith.  He was known for his humor, which he shared freely.  His facile wit was a 
product of his nimble intellect and his innate understanding and love of people.  The 
mention of his name often produced wide smiles or chuckles from people with happy 
memories of a time with him.   

Jerry never met a stranger and was a friend to many.  His friendship was to be 
valued.  He was the kind of true friend who would tell you what you needed to hear, 

even if it was not what you wanted to hear.  His advice and counsel will be missed 
by those who were fortunate enough to benefit from it. 

He was a leader who showed respect to everyone he encountered, especially 
his staff.  Over the years he had several clerks come through his chambers and he 
was always willing to take the time to teach and help them understand the law.  He 
was  a  dedicated  friend  and  mentor  to  Ronda  Mayo,  his  executive  assistant  of  20 
years.   

Jerry had many loves.  First and foremost was his wife Elizabeth Owen.  She 
was  truly  his  partner,  and  they  shared  adventures,  travel,  spirited  political 
discussions, and many happy times with friends.  He knew that Elizabeth enriched 
his life and appreciated all she brought to it.   

Those of us who knew Jerry well will miss the light he brought to our lives, 
his generous spirit, and the common sense of a small-town Tennessee boy he never 
lost. 

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that we honor the life, work, and legacy 

of our dearly departed colleague, Jerry L. Smith. 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Tennessee Judicial Conference that 
this Memorial Resolution be entered on the minutes of this conference, that a copy 
be furnished to West Publishing Company for publication in Tennessee Decisions, 
and 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this tribute and resolution be 

Respectfully submitted this 15th day of June, 2022. 

furnished to his family.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
