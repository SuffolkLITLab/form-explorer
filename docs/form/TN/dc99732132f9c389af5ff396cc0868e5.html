Benchcard for Judges 

The AOC has funding to pay for interpreter costs: 
1. During court hearings in juvenile, general sessions, trial and appellate courts. 
2. Whether the case is a civil case or a criminal case. 
3. Whether the parties are found indigent or not. 

  

 

SUGGESTED QUESTIONS TO ESTABLISH 
INTERPRETER QULAIFICATIONS 

Establish an interpreter’s qualifications on the record 
with questions to assess skills and experience, to 
determine if any conflicts exist, and to demonstrate 
understanding the Code of Ethics for Court 
Interpreters.  
•  Are you credentialed as a court interpreter by the 
State of Tennessee or and other state or federal 
court? 

•  Do you have formal training in interpreting, 

specifically legal interpreting? Please describe your 
formal schooling? 

•  Are you able to interpret simultaneously and 

consecutively? Do you understand that you must 
interpret everything said on the record? 

•  Have you read Rule 41: Rules of Ethics for Spoken 

Foreign Language Interpreters in Tennessee 
Courts? 

•  Are you aware of any conflict of interest you might 
have in this case? Have you interpreted in any 
incident related to this case? 

•  Have you talked with the person briefly? Are there 

any communication problems? 

 

hen should a non-credentialed be appointed? 

A non-credentialed interpreter may be appointed 
only if neither a certified nor a registered interpreter 
is reasonably available and “the court has 
evaluated the totality of the circumstances including 
the gravity of the judicial proceeding and the 
potential penalty or consequence involved.” (SCR 
42) If a language is not listed on the court roster, 
services of a non-credentialed interpreter may be 
utilized. 

Rules that Govern the Appointment, 
Credentialing, and Compensation of 
Interpreters 
Tenn. S. Ct. Rules 41 and 42 
Tenn. R. Evid. 604 
Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-3-813 

         

                                                    W

                   

SUGGESTED QUESTIONS TO ESTABLISH 
NEED FOR AN INTERPRETER AND TO 
DETERMINE LEP 

•  What is your name and address? 
•  Tell the court when your birthday is and 

how old you are? 

•  How did you come to court today? 
•  What kind of work do you do? 
•  How comfortable are you understanding 

and speaking English? 

TEP 1- Determine the Language Spoken 

If you need to determine the language spoken by 
an individual, you may refer the individual to the 
Language Identification Flashcard developed by the 
U.S. Census Bureau. The individual can check or 
point to the box that indicates which language 
he/she speaks.  Once the language has been 
identified, a court interpreter can be appointed if 
necessary.   

TEP 2- Appoint a Credentialed Interpreter 
Appointing an interpreter is a matter of judicial 
discretion. The court shall, pursuant to SCR 42, 
appoint an interpreter according to the following 
preferences: Certified, Registered, and Non-
Credentialed. It is important to appoint according to 
preferences as certified interpreters have passed 
all credentialing requirements. Registered 
interpreters are either waiting to take the oral exam 
or have not passed all parts. Non-credentialed 
interpreters have not completed program 
requirements. 

TEP 3- Locate a Credentialed Interpreter 
The AOC maintains a roster of interpreters at 
www.tncourts.gov.  At the top of the AOC webpage, 
put your cursor on “Programs”. A drop down menu 
appears – click on “Court Interpreters”. On the left 
hand side of the page, click on “Find a Court 
Interpreter”. Follow instructions to find a list of 
interpreters for the language needed. The roster is 
arranged alphabetically by city. If no interpreter is  
listed on the roster for the language you need, 
please contact the AOC at (615) 741-2687.

Benchcard for Judges 

The AOC has funding to pay for interpreter costs: 
1. During court hearings in juvenile, general sessions, trial and appellate courts. 
2. Whether the case is a civil case or a criminal case. 
3. Whether the parties are found indigent or not. 

 

nterpreters are also paid a 2 hour minimum per 
day if in-court interpretation is provided. Travel time 
is included within the 2 hour minimum. Review or                                                                                
transcription/translation of audio or video tapes is 
compensated according to the rates above.  
Document translation is compensated at a rate of 
$.20 per word.  

Translation of Non-Evidentiary Case-Related 
Documents 
 
The decision to translate non-evidentiary case-
related documents is the discretion of the judge. 
 

Translation of Case-Related Documents from 
English into Another Language.  
At times, judges may have a need for interpreters to 
provide a translation of court document or court-ordered 
document from English into another language to give the 
litigant access to the document in the litigant’s language 
or when it may be needed for use by a court or agency 
in another county.  

ranslation of Case-Related Documents for Another 

Language into English:  
At times, judges may have a need to have non-
evidentiary case-related non-English documents 
submitted to the court translated into English, such as 
narrative portions for an emergent application, 
correspondence or court-orders from another county, 
letters from victims, family members, or inmates, and 
birth, death or marriage certificates. 

ranslation of Evidentiary Submissions to the Court.  

Unless otherwise permitted by the court, all evidentiary 
documents are to be presented in English and all non-
English documents intended to be introduced into 
evidence must be accompanied by a certified translation. 
In the alternative and in limited circumstances, the court 
may consider permitting sight translation on the record 
for non-English documents. If the intended evidence is in 
the form of a non-English audio/video recording or text 
message, a transcription in the original language should 
accompany the translation.

ho is Responsible for Securing the Services 

of an Interpreter? 
The Supreme Court rules do not specify whether 
the counsel, party, or court is required to secure the 
services of an interpreter. The trial court can 
resolve this matter by issuing an order placing the 
burden on the person or persons the court deems 
appropriate. The judicial district may wish to 
consider adopting a local rule which sets out who 
has responsibility for securing the services of an 
interpreter. 

hen to Use Multiple Interpreters 

If the court expects the hearing or trial to last for 
several hours or days, the court may wish to 
appoint two interpreters. Due to the level of 
concentration required to accurately conduct a 
simultaneous interpretation, interpreters require 
frequent breaks. If the court appoints two 
interpreters, they can conduct a continuous 
interpretation by alternating, thereby allowing the 
court to conduct the proceedings without 
unnecessary delays or interruptions. 

ompensation for Spanish Interpreters 

Certified  
$50 per hour, with a $500 daily max.   
Registered  
$40 per hour, with a $400 daily max.   
Non-credentialed  
$25 per hour, with a $250 daily max. 

f the court approves an amount in excess of 
($5,000.00) for interpreter/ translator services, the 
order(s) and any attachments must be submitted to 
the AOC for prior approval. 

ompensation for Languages Other Than 

Spanish (LOS) Interpreters 
LOS Interpreters are compensated at a rate not to 
exceed $75 per hour, and the maximum per day 
rate of $500 unless a court makes written findings 
that a higher maximum hourly/per day rate is 
inadequate to secure the services of a qualified 
interpreter for an LOS interpreter.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
