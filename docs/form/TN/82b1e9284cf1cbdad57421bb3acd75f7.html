OPINION

Factual and Procedural History

This case arises from the March 22, 2016 strangulation death of Jeanette Scholten 
(the  victim).    The Hamilton County Grand  Jury indicted Defendant  for first  degree 
premeditated murder.  

At trial, Linda Post testified that she lived in Rossville, Georgia, and that the victim 
was her daughter.  The victim was thirty-four years old at the time of her death.  Ms. Post 
stated that, in the nineteen years she had lived in Georgia, the victim periodically lived with 

03/22/2023her.  Eventually, the victim lived on her own in Georgia and moved in with a boyfriend, 
Micah Adams.  

Ms. Post testified that the victim struggled with “some things” in her life and that 
she smoked, drank “[m]ostly beer,” and used drugs “[o]n and off.”  Ms. Post stated that the 
victim and Mr. Adams ended their relationship, and the victim moved into the Chatt Inn, 
an extended-stay hotel in Hamilton County.  Ms. Post noted that, the night before the victim 
moved into the Chatt Inn, the victim’s dog died, which impacted the victim “terribl[y].”       

Ms.  Post  testified  that  the  victim  worked  as  a  cook  in  different  restaurants.    The 
victim did not own a car and used cars owned by her brother and Ms. Post or took the bus 
to get to work.  

Ms.  Post  testified  that  she  communicated  with  the  victim  by  telephone  and  text 
messages almost every day.  Ms. Post agreed that it was easy to reach the victim, and she 
denied that the victim’s cell phone was ever turned off or not charged.  Although Ms. Post 
did not recall the last time she saw the victim in person, she noted that the victim visited 
her home regularly.

Ms. Post testified that, on March 21, 2016, the victim called her and stated that she 
had a job interview at a restaurant the following day.  Ms. Post was supposed to pick up 
the victim at noon at the Chatt Inn, and she told the victim that she would call at 11:00 a.m. 
and make sure the victim was awake.  Ms. Post noted that she visited the victim at the Chatt 
Inn  many  times  and  was  familiar  with  the  victim’s  room.   Ms.  Post  said  that  the  victim 
sounded excited and optimistic about the interview. 

Ms. Post testified that she called the victim as planned on March 22 but that the call 
went directly to voicemail, which was unusual.  Ms. Post became nervous and called the 
victim’s phone numerous times, with each call also going directly to voicemail.  Ms. Post 
stated that her son, Carl Scholten, was living with her at the time and told her to “be cool 
and wait because she’s a grown woman and let’s wait and call her tomorrow.”  Ms. Post 
said that she agreed because she did not want to be “the meddling mother.”  When Ms. Post 
called the victim the following day, the call again went directly to voicemail.  Ms. Post did 
not reach out to any of the victim’s friends, although she continued to discuss the situation 
with Mr. Scholten.

Ms. Post testified that, on March 24, she and Mr. Scholten drove to the Chatt Inn 
between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m.  They “banged” on the door repeatedly; a neighbor came 
out, who told them that she had not seen the victim.  Ms. Post and Mr. Scholten went to 
the front desk, and an employee escorted them to the victim’s room and opened the door.  
The employee discovered the deceased victim lying on the bed.

Carl Scholten testified that he was the victim’s younger brother.  Mr. Scholten stated 
that the victim was one of his best friends and that he called the victim and saw her multiple 
times per week at Ms. Post’s home.  He also communicated with the victim by text message 
and Facebook.        

Mr. Scholten testified that the victim consistently held a job.  Mr. Scholten stated 
that the victim was “trying to get back into” her relationship with Mr. Adams; he noted that 
he had worked with Mr. Adams for two and a half years.  

Relative to the victim’s drug use, Mr. Scholten testified that “it was off and on . . . .  
I wouldn’t say she was an addict, but if somebody put something in front of her, she would 
[use it] . . . . She struggled with it her whole life, but she was doing so much better[.]”  He 
stated  that  the  victim  used  drugs  like  antidepressants  and  anxiety  medication  instead  of 
street drugs.  Mr. Scholten said that the victim drank beer.  He also testified that the victim 
would  use  cocaine  if  someone  “threw  it  in  front  of  her,”  but  that  she  did  not  seek  out 
cocaine.  
        

Mr. Scholten testified that the  victim had been living  at the Chatt  Inn for  several 
months at the time of her death.  He stated that it was atypical for the victim to live at an 
extended-stay  hotel.    He  explained  that  the  victim  was  “trying  to  get  herself  to  be 
independent  and  be  able  to  take  care  of  herself”  and  that  he  and  Ms.  Post  provided 
emotional support, although they did not like her living there.  The last time Mr. Scholten 
spoke to the victim was the day before her scheduled job interview.  

Mr. Scholten testified that he became concerned about the victim when calls to her 
cell phone went directly to voicemail for two days in a row because “people don’t let their 
phones die.  No one does anymore.”  He did not attempt to contact the victim’s friends or 
coworkers; he noted that it was easier to drive to the hotel.  A neighbor at the hotel told 
Mr. Scholten that she had not seen the victim in three days.

Mr. Scholten testified that he entered the victim’s room with the hotel employee for 
five to ten seconds and that he saw the victim lying on the bed.  When asked to describe 
the victim, Mr. Scholten stated as follows:

She  looked  like  she  was  naked  underneath  the  blanket  that  she  was 
disheveledly [sic] covered up in.  Her left hand . . . was swollen purple as if 
she had, you know, been punching something recently.  She didn’t look like 
the way that she normally slept, you know.  I’ve known her my whole life, 
she didn’t sleep like that. 

. . . .

- 3 -

She slept fully clothed . . . .  And I could tell . . . I know she didn’t sleep like 
that.  It just looked wrong, it looked completely wrong. 

He added that the position of the victim’s body “just didn’t look like the way somebody 
would  be  sleeping[.]”    Mr.  Scholten  agreed  that  he  did  not  have  an  opportunity  to  look 
around the room. 

Mr. Scholten testified that, when the police returned the victim’s personal property 
to them, jewelry, a tablet computer, and other items were missing.  He stated that they later 
found  two  of  the  victim’s  rings,  which  she  had  sold  at  a  pawn  shop,  but  that  the  other 
missing items were never recovered.  

Micah  Adams  testified  that  he  and  the  victim  were  in  a  romantic  relationship  for 
about ten months in 2015.  He stated that they lived together for between three and four 
months before they broke up and the victim moved into the Chatt Inn.  Mr. Adams said 
that he occasionally saw the victim at the Chatt Inn and that their relationship remained 
sexual in nature.  When asked whether he noticed any broken or cut appliance cords in the 
victim’s  room,  Mr.  Adams  stated  that  his  attention  was  not  drawn  to  any  of  the  room’s 
appliances.

Mr. Adams testified that the victim occasionally asked him to tie her up and choke 
her during sex; he characterized it as not “outside of what is typical for many women.”  He 
denied ever actually tying the victim up or using force to hold her down.  Mr. Adams stated 
that he would put his hand on the victim’s neck “[a]s a matter of placement and the fantasy 
of control, rather than actual asphyxiation.”  He denied that the victim ever asked him to 
use force to choke her and said that he never did so.  Mr. Adams denied that the victim 
ever asked him to be “violent” with her.        

Mr. Adams did not recall the last time he was intimate with the victim or spoke with 
her.  He stated that the police contacted him a “matter of days” after the victim’s body was 
found and that he gave a statement.  Mr. Adams said that, on March 21, 2016, he was at a 
bar, the Bitter Alibi, with coworkers.  He stated that the victim was a smoker and that she 
owned a cigarette rolling machine to save money.  Mr. Adams said that the victim loved 
her dog and was upset when the dog died.  

On cross-examination, Mr. Adams testified that he and the victim frequently fought 
during  their  relationship.    He  agreed  that  the  victim  had  mood  swings,  would  become 
angry,  and  that  a “physical” incident  occurred  when  he  asked  the  victim  to  leave  their 
shared apartment.  

Mr. Adams did not recall showing the police a photograph of a woman the victim 
was  dating.    He  noted  that  he  did  not  doubt  the  accuracy  of  the  police  interview 
documentation  but stated that  “any  details  [he]  may  have  given  them  would  have  been 

- 4 -

under extreme duress.”  Mr. Adams acknowledged that the victim cheated on him a few 
times during their relationship.  He denied that he ever tried to tie up the victim or that he 
told  Defendant’s  previous  counsel  that  he  used  nylon  cords  to  tie  up  the  victim  on  one 
occasion but “wasn’t very good at it.”  Mr. Adams agreed that the victim liked him to be 
“forceful” during sex, including holding her down, but he stated that he never left bruises 
on her.  Mr. Adams stated that the victim was commonly depressed.

Mr. Adams testified that the victim had two cell phones, one provided by Ms. Post 
and one he had given the victim “to help her get on her feet.”  Mr. Adams stated that the 
victim usually drank Milwaukee’s Best Ice beer in thirty-two-ounce plastic bottles.  Mr. 
Adams  stated that  she  did  not  drink “all  the  time.”    He  said  that  the  victim  had  a  fixed 
schedule  and  that  “[t]here  were  predictable  times  when  she  wouldn’t  respond”  to  text 
messages. 

When asked if the victim became angry when he did not comply with demands to 
choke her during sex, Mr. Adams responded that the victim was easily angered and that 
“[t]here were lots of disappointing things that she got angry about, and pointing just one 
[out] is not only difficult, but I feel somewhat inappropriate.”  He agreed, though, that the 
victim became irrationally angry when he declined to put his hand on her neck.  Mr. Adams 
did not think the victim’s sexual requests were “out of the ordinary” or alarming.  He stated 
that he had other partners who requested similar behavior.  Mr. Adams declined to answer 
whether he and the victim engaged in anal intercourse.  

Mr.  Adams  testified  that  he  was  only  familiar  with  the  Chatt  Inn  because  of  the 
victim and that he occasionally spent the night there with the victim.  He agreed that, on 
more than one occasion when he visited the victim, an unidentified person called the room 
telephone,  did  not  speak  when  the  telephone  was  answered,  and  hung  up.    Mr.  Adams 
acknowledged a portion of the police interview, in which he recounted an incident at the 
victim’s hotel room in which someone “banged on the door” for several minutes without 
stopping but said that he did not remember that incident at the time of trial.

Mr. Adams testified that the Chatt Inn was a “typical . . . stay-by-the-week hotel” 
and that few people would choose to live there.  When asked if unknown people would 
follow Mr. Adams and the victim when they walked to the Chatt Inn from a nearby Waffle 
House at night, Mr. Adams stated that it did not sound out of the ordinary for that area.          

Trester Payne testified that, in 2016, he was the property manager at the Chatt Inn 
and lived onsite.  Mr. Payne stated that most of the hotel’s guests were long-term residents 
who could not afford a house or an apartment due to a lack of means or poor credit.  Mr. 
Payne identified Defendant in the courtroom and stated that he stayed at the Chatt Inn for 
two or three months in early 2016.  Mr. Payne stated that two or three weeks before the 
victim’s death, he evicted Defendant.

- 5 -

Mr. Payne testified that he “had words with” Defendant two or three times during 
Defendant’s stay.  He described Defendant as “a little skittish, would run from [him],” and 
he noted that Defendant left in the morning and returned in the evenings after Mr. Payne 
was off work.  Mr. Payne stated that Defendant was evicted due to drug use.  He said that 
Defendant’s room contained garbage and several bottles of prescription medication, which 
were all prescribed to Defendant.  Mr. Payne stated that Defendant was also banned from 
the property, but surveillance footage showed he returned and went to the victim’s room.  
Mr. Payne noted that Defendant came on the property in the evenings when Mr. Payne was 
not working.

Mr. Payne testified that the victim moved to the Chatt Inn in late 2015, that she had 
been  there  for  several  months  by  the  time  Defendant  moved  in,  and  that  Mr.  Payne 
interacted with the victim almost daily.  He described the victim as a “quiet, shy” woman 
who kept to herself and was “kind of skittish of people at the hotel.”  Mr. Payne noted that 
the victim was “a little depressed” and had lost her dog.  He stated that he had no problems 
with or complaints about the victim.  Mr. Payne denied that the victim was violent, loud, 
or  aggressive;  he  had  never  seen  the  victim  with  Defendant.    Mr.  Payne  stated  that 
Defendant stayed on the same side of the hotel as the victim, that Defendant was on the 
first floor, and that the victim had a second floor corner room.  He estimated that Defendant 
could have reached the victim’s room in a minute and a half.  

Mr. Payne testified that, on March 24, 2016, one of the maintenance workers called
him and relayed that Ms. Post and Mr. Scholten had shown up because they had not heard 
from  the  victim.    Mr.  Payne  stated  that  he  and  the  maintenance  worker  went  inside  the 
victim’s room, and Mr. Payne walked to the bathroom.  Upon exiting the bathroom, he saw 
the victim  “strowed across the bed with the cover across her”; Mr. Payne checked for a 
pulse, noted that the victim’s body was cold, exited the room, and called the police.  

Mr. Payne testified that, after the police finished inspecting the room and removed 
the  victim’s  body,  Mr.  Payne  entered the  room  to  pack  up  the  victim’s  belongings  and 
return them to Ms. Post.  He noted that a chair was in the middle of the floor that “had a 
piece of string tied to the bottom of it, and hair all over it[.]”  Mr. Payne thought it was odd 
because the victim no longer had a dog.  He said that, after he began packing up the victim’s 
belongings, he had to leave to attend to an unrelated situation.  Thirty minutes later, the 
police returned and told Mr. Payne that the room was a crime scene.  

On cross-examination, Mr. Payne testified that he did not know whether Defendant 
was working when he left the hotel or where he worked.  Mr. Payne stated that he “would 
have never suspected” that the victim used drugs, and he noted that she was not “like the 
majority  that  [he]  had  to  deal  with.”    He  noted  that  the  hotel’s  owners  wanted  to  help 
people, that they “turned the hotel around” and “put a lot of people through drug programs,” 

- 6 -

and that, at the time Defendant lived there, they had “cameras in place everywhere” that
Mr. Payne installed.  

Lorraine Blevins testified that, in March 2016, she was living at the Chatt Inn.  Ms. 
Blevins was familiar with the victim in passing but never met her.  Ms. Blevins lived on 
the opposite end of the building, about four rooms down from the victim.  Ms. Blevins did 
not know Defendant.  She stated that, on March 24, 2016, she noticed many police onsite 
and  that  she  learned  of  the  victim’s  death  while  watching  the  local  news.    The  police 
interviewed her later in the afternoon or evening of March 24.  

Ms. Blevins testified that she told the police that, “a couple days prior[,]” she woke 
up after going to bed and heard a man and a woman arguing.  She stated that the sound 
came from the direction of the victim’s room.  Ms. Blevins stated that she looked outside 
in  response  to  the  noise  and  that  her  roommate  walked  around  in  the  breezeway.    She 
described the argument as loud and “aggressive” in tone, although she could not hear what 
they were saying.  The argument lasted about forty-five minutes and occurred after dark.  
Ms. Blevins estimated that the argument occurred between late Monday night and early 
Tuesday morning; the victim’s body was found on Thursday of that week.  She said that it 
eventually became quiet, but she could not recall whether the argument ended suddenly or 
“trail[ed] off.”  She later stated, though, that the end of the noise was “abrupt” and that the 
argument  did  not resume throughout  the  night.    Ms.  Blevins  noted that  she  and  her 
roommate decided to watch a movie and “were trying not to pay attention” to the argument.  
She  said,  though,  that  she  did  not  hear  any  doors  open  or  close  or  any  cars  start  or  pull 
away.  Ms. Blevins agreed that the walls were thin at the hotel and that she would have 
heard any such sounds.

Robin Combs testified that she lived at the Chatt Inn in March 2016.  Ms. Combs 
knew the victim in passing as the “[l]ittle red-headed girl,” which was how people in the 
hotel referred to her.  The victim lived on the second floor of the hotel, whereas Ms. Combs
and Defendant lived on the first floor.  Ms. Combs stated that Defendant told her that he 
was evicted because Mr. Payne “had it out for him” but that other people said Defendant 
was evicted due to drugs.  Ms. Combs stated that Defendant began living with friends at a 
different hotel and that she saw him “here and there throughout town, just scattered about.”    

Ms. Combs testified that she saw Defendant at the bus stop near the Chatt Inn on 
the night of March 21, 2016.  Defendant told Ms. Combs that he would stay overnight in 
“Jeanene[’]s” apartment at the Chatt Inn; when Ms. Combs asked who that was, Defendant 
clarified, “The little red-headed girl.”  Defendant said that he would enter the hotel after
dark or when the front desk employees left for the night.  

Ms. Combs testified that she customarily rode the bus to work at 6:00 a.m. and that, 
on the morning of March 22, Defendant was at the bus stop when she arrived.  Ms. Combs 

- 7 -

noted that this was unusual and that, when Defendant was working, he would get a ride to 
work or travel by bicycle.  Ms. Combs stated that Defendant had two large duffle bags with 
him and that he was pacing and “more nervous than he normally [was].”  She explained 
that Defendant was “kind of a nervous type[.]”  

Ms. Combs described the following interaction:  

[Defendant] kept on talking about the little red-headed girl and he was like   
. . . “I’m never going back there again, I’m never going back there again.”  

I’m like, [“]Well, what happened?[”] 

He’s like, [“]She told me to leave.[”] 

Which I thought, [“]Well, get gone.[“]

. . . .

He just said she’s crazy.  I mean that’s a one-off; when somebody’s not happy 
with somebody’s behavior, they’ll normally characterize them as something 
like that.  He said she was acting crazy. 

Ms. Combs said that Defendant did not indicate whether he left or why the victim 
asked him to leave.  When asked whether Defendant had ever spoken about the victim in a 
similar manner, Ms. Combs responded, “Never.  He had always held her in high esteem.”

Ms. Combs testified that she and Defendant boarded the same bus and that, during 
the  trip,  Defendant  “kept  going  back  talking  about  [the  victim],  just  conversation  kept 
going back to her.”  She stated that Defendant was falling asleep mid-sentence and “just 
kept on talking about . . . you know, she’s crazy, I’m not going back there, stuff like that, 
I mean.”  She said that Defendant also talked about his mother, whom they had discussed 
on previous occasions.  

Ms. Combs stated that they were at the bus stop for five to ten minutes and on the 
bus for twenty to thirty minutes.  Ms. Combs and Defendant transferred to a different bus 
before Defendant exited “to go to Work Force.”  Ms. Combs advised Defendant not to go 
to Work Force because he would “lose all prospects of getting a job in the future because 
[he was] obviously not [him]self, something’s not right here.”  Ms. Combs told Defendant 
to get some sleep, but Defendant exited the bus and stated that he was going to drink some 
coffee.  Ms. Combs testified that she contacted the police after seeing a news article on the 
internet about the victim’s death. 

- 8 -

On  cross-examination,  Ms.  Combs  testified  that  she  typically  saw  Defendant  on 
Saturday nights when she used the Chatt Inn’s laundromat.  Defendant would sit with her 
and talk while she did laundry.  She was aware that Defendant worked for a “heat and air 
unit place.”  

Chattanooga  Police  Department  (CPD)  Sergeant  Taylor  Walker  testified  that,  on 
March 24, 2016, he was working in the violent crimes division and was dispatched to the 
Chatt  Inn.    Sergeant  Walker,  a  crime  scene  investigator,  and  an  investigator  with  the 
medical examiner’s office entered the victim’s room together just before 1:00 p.m.  

Sergeant  Walker  testified  that  he  saw  the  victim  lying partially  on  her  back  and 
partially on her right side on the bed; her head was on a pillow.  The victim was wearing a 
grey sweatshirt, and a blanket covered her lower body.  She was wearing a sock  on her 
right foot, but not on her left.  Sergeant Walker noted “some sort of dark stain liquid” on 
the  corner  of  the  pillow.    Sergeant  Walker  described  the  hotel  room  as  “very  odd  and 
strange,” and he stated the following:

[I]n between the bed and the nightstand, there was a black device which we 
later found out was a cigarette rolling machine . . . . Plus, the telephone had 
a cord severed.  And it was just very strange that there was a cord severed to 
these two devices in between the nightstand and the bed.  And there was a 
chair  that  was  next  to  the  bed  that  also  had  dis-cordage  [sic]  from,  I’m 
assuming the cigarette machine, and from the phone, that were sitting on the 
chair next to the bed.  And then there was another piece of cord or string or 
something that was like on the foot of the chair.

Sergeant Walker stated that, to the right of the nightstand, clothing was on the ground that 
had the same dark stain as the pillow.  

Sergeant Walker testified that the victim had an abrasion on her forehead and that it 
appeared she had been there “for a little while.”  After moving the blanket covering the 
victim,  Sergeant  Walker  observed  that  she  was  nude  from  the  waist  down.    A  pair  of 
women’s underwear was “crumpled up” on the victim’s upper right thigh, and her right leg 
was extended, whereas her left leg was “sort of pulled up to her chest.”  Sergeant Walker 
stated that feces were smeared on different parts of the victim’s thighs.  He added that they 
found  feces  near clothing  on  the  floor  near  the  nightstand  and  on  the  victim’s  pillow.  
Sergeant Walker said that, although it was common to find feces when a person had passed 
away,  the  placement  of  the  fecal  smears  on  the  victim’s  body  was  odd.    Other  than  the 
forehead abrasion, Sergeant Walker did not observe any injuries to the victim.

Sergeant Walker testified that they also found pieces of hair on the victim’s legs and 
in the victim’s underwear, which he described as “hair like perhaps from her head or from 

- 9 -

another location; not heavy clumps, but just hair.”  Relative to the pieces of cord around 
the  chair,  he  stated  that  they  were  tied  together  “like  they  were  ready  to  be  used  for 
something.”  

Sergeant  Walker  opined  that  there  appeared  to  have  been  a  struggle  in  the  room, 
although it was unusual that the victim had no obvious injuries.  Sergeant Walker stated 
that, generally, once the crime scene investigators and medical examiner were finished with 
a  crime  scene,  he  would  release  the  crime  scene.    He  said,  though,  that  in  this  case,  he 
instructed a patrol officer to “hold” the scene until the medical examiner had examined the 
victim.  Sergeant Walker noted that everything at the crime scene felt “out of place” and 
that he had not held a crime scene in a similar manner before or since.  Around 2:40 p.m., 
the  medical  examiner  called  Sergeant  Walker  and  conveyed  that  the  preliminary 
examination  had  not  revealed  additional  injuries;  Sergeant  Walker  allowed  the  patrol 
officer to leave the crime scene.  However, the medical examiner’s office called Sergeant 
Walker  again  at  about  3:47  p.m.,  and  as  a  result  of  that  conversation,  Sergeant  Walker 
referred the case to the homicide unit.  

On cross-examination, Sergeant Walker testified that he learned from the victim’s 
family that she was an alcoholic.  He agreed that he saw beer cans in the victim’s room.  
Sergeant Walker affirmed that he saw no injuries to the victim that were consistent with a 
struggle.

CPD crime scene investigator Gregory Mardis testified that he processed the crime 
scene.    Investigator  Mardis  stated  that  the room  “was  cluttered,  to  an  extent,  but  it  .  .  . 
seemed to be disturbed more than just cluttered.”  He elaborated that electrical cords were 
on top of a chair, that “cordage and small . . . nylon-type cord” was on the floor next to the 
bed, and that a dog leash was tied to an electrical cord from a space heater.  Investigator 
Mardis opined that it was odd to see bits of cord tied together “for no obvious reason.”  

Investigator Mardis identified a video recording of the crime scene and photographs 
he took.  The video was played for the jury and reflected that the victim was lying with her 
head and torso facing upward, and her hips and legs were turned such that her left leg was 
bent forward and her right leg was extended behind her; her right foot was hanging off the 
bed  beside  the  back  of  a  chair.    A  piece  of  blue  and  white  plaid-patterned  cloth  was 
underneath the victim’s ankle and tied to the chair, which was touching the side of the bed.  
Investigator  Mardis  stated that  the  cloth  was similar  to  a  pillowcase.    A  length  of  black 
electrical cord, including a plug, was visible in the seat of the chair.  A purple cloth was 
visible on top of the victim’s right upper inner thigh, which Investigator Mardis identified 
as  women’s  underwear.    Investigator  Mardis noted  that  fecal  stains were  found on  the 
pillow  beneath  the  victim’s  head,  the  victim’s  face,  leg,  and  back,  and  a  pillow  further 
down on the bed near the victim’s legs.

Investigator Mardis pointed out a piece of electrical cord in the floor that had been 
cut off of an appliance, which was tied to a piece of nylon cord similar to a shoelace; he 
noted that it “ha[d] a lot of hair tied into the knot.”  He agreed that a black sneaker visible 
in  the  video  did  not  appear  to  have  shoelaces.   Investigator  Mardis identified  additional 
fecal stains on a space heater and a gray jacket; the cord from the space heater, the jacket, 
and a dog leash had been tied together to form a long string.  The room’s telephone cord 
and the cigarette rolling machine’s cord had been severed.  Investigator Mardis noted that 
the rolling machine’s cord could have been unplugged from the machine without cutting 
it.  The rolling machine, which was black, had what appeared to be the end of a telephone 
jack and a short portion of white cord tied around its arm.  Investigator Mardis testified 
that behind the bathroom door, they found a pair of orange women’s underwear and a blue 
dress.  

Investigator Mardis identified crime scene photographs he took, which depicted the 
victim’s body in more detail.  The photographs reflected a large abrasion taking up most 
of the center of the victim’s forehead.  

Investigator  Mardis stated  that  they  took  swabs  of  a  stain  on  the  outside  of  the 
room’s exterior door and the wall near the door.  He agreed that the beer bottles in the room 
were all Milwaukee’s Best brand, and to his recollection the beer cans in the room were all 
Bud Ice brand.  Investigator Mardis opined that the electrical cords had been “clean cut,” 
and he noted that a scalpel was found in the victim’s bedding.  He collected a blue LG cell 
phone from the top of the nightstand, and the evidence log reflected that a ZTE cell phone 
was collected from the nightstand’s drawer.

Investigator Mardis testified that, after investigators collected some of the evidence, 
they  were  informed  that  they  could  release  the  room;  however,  within  five  minutes,  the 
investigators were sent back to the room to collect additional evidence.  Investigator Mardis 
also collected a latent fingerprint from a pack of cigarettes in the room, which tested as 
belonging to the victim.

On  cross-examination,  Investigator  Mardis  testified  that  a  leather  jacket  was 
hanging on a rack near the door.  He did not obtain fingerprints from the hotel telephone, 
the cigarette rolling machine, or the chair; he noted that they attempted unsuccessfully to 
dust the chair for fingerprints.  Investigator Mardis agreed that a towel was near the victim’s 
side on the bed.  He acknowledged that he did not perform biological testing to identify 
fecal matter.  He further acknowledged that he did not know what caused the abrasion to 
the victim’s forehead.  

Investigator  Mardis  testified  that  the  scalpel  was  “evidently  wrapped  up  in 
something” and was only found later; consequently, he did not photograph it at the crime 

- 11 -

scene.  He agreed that the victim’s body had no visible bruising.  He did not collect an anal 
swab from the victim.

CPD Sergeant David Franklin, an expert in latent fingerprint examination, testified 
that he identified a latent print taken from a cigarette pack as belonging to the victim.  He 
agreed  that  the  fingerprint  was  the  only  one  he  received  to  analyze.    He  stated  that 
fingerprints might not be deposited when a person wore gloves or did not perspire, when 
the air was “not conducive to leaving prints,” or when the prints had been wiped off.  

CPD  Officer  Dennis  Nelson  testified  that,  on  March  24,  2016,  he  collected 
fingerprints from Mr. Adams.  The following day, he collected personal items that had been 
seized  from  Defendant—a  green  backpack,  a  “plastic  Burlington  bag,”  and  a  black 
computer  bag.    Officer  Nelson  identified  a  photograph  of  the  items  inside  Defendant’s 
backpack, which included several pieces of clothing, baseball hats and knit caps, three cell 
phones, two wallets, two pairs of gloves, a cell phone charger, fifty-five dollars in cash, 
medication bottles, and a piece of paper with a brown stain.  

On cross-examination, Officer Nelson testified that several packets of instant coffee 
were among Defendant’s belongings.  Officer Nelson did not know if the brown stain on 
the piece of paper was coffee or whether the paper was sent to the Tennessee Bureau of 
Investigation  (TBI) for  testing.    He  did  not  believe  the  LG  cell  phone  was swabbed  for 
DNA or tested for fingerprints.  

Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office Detective Ed Merritt testified that on September 
2,  2019,  CPD  asked  him  to  assist  them  in  Defendant’s  case;  he  explained  that  the  CPD 
employee  who performed forensic  downloads  on  cell  phones  had  retired  recently.  
Detective Merritt was asked to analyze two of Defendant’s cell phones.  The first phone, a 
Kyocera, did not function due to an issue with the battery.  He was able to generate a report 
from data on the second phone, an LG.  Detective Merritt noted that the report was 2,824 
pages.
   

Mark Hamilton, an expert in forensic technology, testified that, in 2016, he assisted 
CPD in their investigation of the victim’s death by analyzing the victim’s two cell phones.  
He stated that he was unable to download the data on the ZTE phone and that he instead 
performed a “scroll analysis” in which he took photographs of the phone’s screen.  In the 
second phone, an LG, the “contacts that transferred electricity from the battery to the phone 
were damaged.”  Mr. Hamilton noted that the LG was missing its battery when he received 
it and that he soldered wires to the phone to power it.  

Mr. Hamilton testified that the LG had “quite a bit of activity” on March 21, 2016, 
which ended just before midnight.  The last incoming call was from a telephone number 
labeled in the phone’s contacts as “Mark.”

Mr. Hamilton testified that, on two occasions, he went to the Chatt Inn and obtained 
surveillance recordings.  He stated that the system was set to “motion record” on multiple 
cameras, which started recording in response to a change in light.  Mr. Hamilton explained 
that  setting  the  cameras  to  motion  record  saved  hard  drive  space  in  comparison  to 
continuous recording.  He noted that motion recording was identifiable because the system 
contained files of different sizes, whereas continuous recording would be broken up into 
identically-sized  files.    Mr.  Hamilton  stated  that  the  hotel’s  owner  “actually pulled  just 
[video of] the incident” because a longer file was taking too long to download.        

Mr. Hamilton testified that he created a “compilation” using the surveillance footage 
and the victim’s cell phone data.  He stated that no outgoing communication came from 
the  victim’s  cell  phone  after a  man,  later  identified  as Defendant, was  visible  on  the 
surveillance footage leaving the victim’s room at 5:48 a.m.  Mr. Hamilton noted that he 
identified the man as Defendant because Defendant sent the victim a text message asking 
her to open her door at 7:43 p.m., the same time at which the man in the recordings entered 
the victim’s room.  

In surveillance  footage showing  a  first-floor  courtyard,  Defendant  was  wearing  a 
dark jacket with a light-colored collared shirt, light-colored long pants, and a cap, and he 
was carrying a duffle bag in one of his hands.  Mr. Hamilton identified Defendant in footage 
from the Chatt Inn’s second floor; in this segment, he was wearing a backpack and carrying 
a similar bag in his hand.  Mr. Hamilton noted that the timestamp in the surveillance footage 
was off by one hour and that daylight savings time occurred just prior to March 21, 2016.  
He  stated  that,  after  Defendant  left  the  victim’s  room,  Defendant attempted to  open  the 
door to the hotel office shortly after 5:48 a.m.; he was still wearing a backpack and carrying 
a duffle bag.

On  cross-examination,  Mr.  Hamilton  testified that he  and  detectives  directed  the 
hotel owner on how to download the recording.  Mr. Hamilton acknowledged that he did 
not  inspect  the  surveillance  system  settings or  watch  the  entire  recording  depicting  the 
seventy-two hours between the time Defendant left the victim’s room and when Ms. Post 
and  Mr.  Scholten  arrived.    He  agreed  that  he  did  not  know  if  anyone  entered  the  room 
during that time.  

Mr.  Hamilton  testified  that,  generally,  he  placed  cell  phones  inside  a  box  before 
downloading  their  contents,  which insulated  them  from  connecting  to  the  telephone 
network.  However, Mr. Hamilton worked on the victim’s LG cell phone at a workbench 
in  order  to  connect  it  to  electricity  via  the  soldered  wires.    Mr.  Hamilton  noted  that  the 
phone connected to the network when it powered up and that it downloaded messages “that 
were sitting in queue at the provider.”  He stated that the messages in the report reflected 
the date and time the victim’s cell phone received them, not the date they were sent.  The 
inbound messages to which he referred were dated March 24, 2016.

The  data  report  from Defendant’s LG cell  phone,  which  had  a  number  ending  in        

-9548, reflected that a telephone number ending in -7290 corresponded to a contact labeled
“Jeannette 236.”1  The data report from the victim’s LG cell phone, which had a number 
ending  in  -7290,  reflected  that  a  telephone  number  ending  in  -9548  corresponded  to  a 
contact labeled “Mark.”  

CPD  Investigator  Lucas  Fuller  testified  that  he  responded  to  the  crime  scene  and 
that no evidence of forced entry existed.  The victim’s room was only accessible by the 
front  door.    After  speaking  to  the  victim’s  neighbors,  Investigator  Fuller  contacted  Mr. 
Adams, who reported that he was in recent contact with the victim but had not been able 
to reach her in the days prior to March 24.  Mr. Adams informed the police that the victim 
had two cell phones, which they confirmed.  Mr. Adams also consented to be processed, 
which involved giving a buccal swab and being photographed and fingerprinted. 

Investigator Fuller testified that the victim’s LG cell phone was missing its battery 
and “it appeared that it had been manipulated, the actual battery portion of the phone had 
been damaged[.]”  Investigator Fuller used Facebook to cross-reference the contact number 
ending  in  -9548,  which  led  him  to  Defendant.    The  police  could  not  initially  locate 
Defendant.

Investigator  Fuller  testified  relative  to  the  surveillance  recordings  that  Defendant 
entered the Chatt Inn property at about 7:43 p.m. on March 21, that Defendant was carrying 
a  backpack  and  duffle  bag,  that  Defendant  appeared  to  be  texting  someone,  and  that  he 
entered the victim’s room.  Investigator Fuller stated that, at about 6:00 a.m. on March 22, 
Defendant exited the victim’s room and attempted to enter the locked lobby.  Investigator 
Fuller  said  that  no  outgoing  messages  were  sent  from  the  victim’s  cell  phone  after 
Defendant’s departure.  

Investigator  Fuller  testified  that,  after  speaking  to  Ms.  Combs,  he  reviewed 
surveillance  recordings  of  the  bus  she  and  Defendant  rode  to  corroborate  her  account.  
Additionally, Investigator Fuller submitted a request to Defendant’s cell phone provider to 
obtain the locations at which his cell phone “pinged” a cell tower or WiFi.  Police located 
Defendant  and  executed  a  search  warrant  to  obtain  a  buccal  swab,  photographs,  and 
fingerprints.  Defendant’s belongings included a baseball cap that was similar to the one 
he was seen wearing in the Chatt Inn surveillance recordings; a baseball cap bearing the 
logo of a restaurant at which the victim worked; and Defendant’s two cell phones. 

                                           

1 The trial testimony indicated that the victim’s hotel room at the Chatt Inn was number 236.

into  the  record  text  messages  exchanged  between 
Defendant and the victim.  On February 18, 2016, Defendant stated, “No wonder you said 
if he comes, though, let you know.  Otherwise you wouldn’t have any use to visit me . . . . 
Manipulate me.  I felt a connection and I know you did too.  You can’t help that you are a 
fri[gi]d cold b--ch.”  The victim replied, 

I apologize, I wasn’t feeling very well earlier, in a lot of pain.  I’m not trying 
to manipulate you, no needing for the name calling, I’m already aware of my 
faults.    And  I  did  pay  for  that  piece  of  wafer  you  gave  me,  don’t  you 
remember?  I am not looking for a relationship, I recently broke up with my 
ex and want to be single for a while.  I like hanging out with you, you are a 
good friend.    

Defendant responded, 

I want to be single to get  my life on balance, we can help each other with 
that, give each other advice.  If we are mature adults, we can be single but 
still  share  an  intimate  moment  two  or  three  times  every  couple  of  weeks.  
Knowing that it’s a physiological need and knowing that it’s just for now and 
there’s  no  commitments,  just  two  adults  going  through  life’s  growing 
process.  We do have some emotional and physical needs.  Knowing that we 
can share intimacy once every week or so, it will help us both to grow and 
also help us get out of our shell.  We can be close friends to each other.  I’m 
going to need feedback on my resume.  I think you are an intelligent person, 
I respect you.  I’ll need help with my interview clothes and tie.  I have a big 
engineering interview coming up, I need your help.  Anything you ever want 
or need, I’ll be there for you.

The victim did not respond.  A couple of hours later, Defendant sent the following:

What time do you get off?  I think we had a good night two nights ago, we 
had  some  very  pleasant  moments  of  intimacy,  but  at  the  same  time,  we’re 
respectful of each other’s boundaries.  I could tell you enjoyed the physical 
contact.  Even a few of the heartfelt kisses I gave you, you smiled.  You let 
me continue with touching your breasts and at one point, I was touching you 
in your crotch and you let me continue for a few minutes.  You were even 

                                           

2 Our review of the data extraction reports of the victim’s and Defendant’s cell phones reflects that 
Investigator  Fuller’s  testimony  accurately  conveys  the  meaning  of  the  messages;  we  have  recited  the 
testimony,  rather  than  the  messages  as  originally  written,  because  the  messages  contain  multiple 
typographical errors.

pressing your p---y up toward my hand.  We were on the verge of hinching 
[sic].

The victim did not respond.  

On  February  25,  2016,  Defendant  called  the  victim’s  cell  phone  for  forty-two 
seconds.  The victim sent a text message asking if he had called her and asked, “What’s 
up?”  Defendant responded, “Whatever you need.”  The victim replied, 

I  am  walking  home  from  work  right  now  and  boy  am  I  grumpy,  I’m 
absolutely broke until Monday, I don’t have for anything.  Been walking to 
and from work for the past few days, even tried to pawn my nice Eddie Bauer 
jacket but the pawnshop has too many leather jackets already.  I have your 
hat too.  You said you wanted it back.

Defendant stated, “Last time I tried to give you a hug, you acted like I had the plague or 
something.    I’m  fine.”    The  victim  replied,  “Mark,  I’ve  been  pushing  people  away  my 
whole life, I’ve had some very unfortunate things happen to me.  I apologize if you feel 
that way.”  Defendant stated, 

Okay.  Bye.  You have succeeded in pushing me away.  But since you were 
my friend and I got you . . . this other fleece, I’ll bring it up.  I just tried to 
bring  you  the  fleece  last  night,  I  came  up  to  you.    Text  me.    Then  won’t 
answer your door.  I’ll smoke it myself again, I guess.

The  victim  responded,  “I  am  still  walking  home,  calm  down,  I  have  plenty  of  fleeces,  I 
don’t need anymore, thank you.  You said some really hurtful things to me and said bye.  
Why are you bothering me?”  Defendant replied, “You texted me.”

On March 17, 2016, the victim texted Defendant, asking, “Hey stranger, how are 
you?”  Defendant replied, “Good, I have drugs, I am downtown. You home?”  The victim 
stated, “Yeah, drugs are always good[.]”  After an exchange in which Defendant conveyed 
his location and the types of drugs he had, the victim stated, “If I can get a few and smoke 
with you, for sure, come by and chill for a while.”  The victim asked if he could bring beer 
and followed up in messages asking if he was coming over.  Defendant gave an estimated 
arrival time, then texted another contact, labeled as “Latoya,” asking, “Can you come to 
Chatt  Inn,  a  twenty-dollar,  I’m  near  there.    I  was  above  my  old  room  with  my  girl.”  
Defendant also texted an additional contact, labeled as “Grey Dirty,” stating, “I’m on 23rd 
Street on foot, need a 20.  At my girl’s room.  I will walk to gas station.”

On March 18, 2016, Defendant messaged the victim, “It felt good sharing your bed.  
The comfort of you beside me made me feel complete, a sense of being where I belong.  I

was good.  I think I put one hand on your shoulder twice all night.”  The victim did not 
respond.

On March 19, 2016, at about 9:00 p.m., Defendant texted the victim, asking, “When 
you going home?”  The victim responded, “I’m home.  My brother is coming to pick me 
up after he  gets off work.  What’s up?”   Defendant stated, “I am freezing.  Nowhere to 
sleep, walking the street.  Give you two Xanax bars and . . . three[]dollars to crash on the 
floor.  I got a Klonopin.  Help, it’s freezing.”  The victim responded,  “I thought you were 
staying with that chick.  D--n.”  Defendant stated, “She has some guy up there.  Me and 
her weren’t really like that.  Just told me.  I was on street tonight.”  The victim responded, 
“I am not looking for a relationship either, Mark.  I have told you time and time again.”  
Defendant stated, “Me either.  Did I touch you inappropriately last night?  No, because I 
don’t want to ruin our friendship.”  The victim said, “I don’t know, I was sleeping.  You 
come on really strong when you’re over here, why can’t you stay with that lady, because 
she has a guy over?”  Defendant continued, “I don’t mind sleeping on the floor.  I did very 
good last night, I did not touch you wrong once yesterday.  I’m so cold and sleepy.”

The following morning, at about 7:00 a.m., the victim texted Defendant, “Where are 
you sleeping tonight, sleeping at that lady’s place?”  Defendant responded, “I slept in [an] 
abandoned  building  on  [the] floor.”    The  victim  stated,  “Sorry,  but  it’s  not  my  fault.”  
Defendant stated, “I did not say it was your fault.  You asked me where I slept, I told you 
the  truth.”    A  little  before  6:00  p.m.,  the  victim  texted  Defendant  again,  stating  that  he 
should “make up” with the woman so that he had a place to sleep because it was going to 
be cold that evening.  

On March 21, 2016, a little before 5:00 p.m., Defendant texted the victim and asked 
if she was working.  The victim responded negatively, saying that she was “sitting here 
bored and broke.”  A brief conversation occurred, which Investigator Fuller testified was a 
discussion of illegal narcotics.  Defendant stated that he had a “goody bag” for the victim 
and that he would travel to her location.  Defendant then sent another message: “You have 
to admit I was very respectful two days ago.  True?”  The victim responded, “So what’s it 
going to be?  You bring 20 hard, a piece, some green, maybe a xany bar and we got a deal.”

About  five  minutes  later,  Defendant  texted  a  contact  labeled  as  “19newcell1,” 

stating, 

This red head wants me to spend night at Chatt Inn, great p---y, I’m broke.  
You give me a five for a couple more good chunks of Xanax so an old guy 
can get some p---y?  She’s a waitress at that ritzy cocktail bar, STIR3, at the 

                                           

3 Other trial testimony reflected that the victim worked at STIR.

Choo-Choo,  three-story  bar.    I  can  line  you  and  your  old  lady  up  with  20 
percent discount.

Defendant continued messaging the victim, stating, “Checking now on trading for the 20. 
I have a 10 I can let you have right now.  One small, have my 20, I have everything else.
Text you in five to ten minutes . . . . Working on it ‘friend[.]’”  The victim responded, “Last 
time, you promised all that but didn’t come through.  At least have the 10 and a xany with 
a piece[.  I] let you stay here.”  Defendant then texted that he did not have the variety of 
drugs he originally mentioned and that some drugs he had “distintegrated” in his pocket, 
the  victim  stated,  “You  just  said  it  disintegrated,  that’s  what  you  said  the  other  night. 
Please.  Look, dude, you promised that the other night and reneged.  Not again.”  

During a subsequent  text  conversation with  Defendant  on  March  21,  the  victim 
complained  that  Defendant  had  been  “BS-ing  [her]  all  night”  and  that  his  “lying  [was] 
aggravating [her].”  The victim also warned him not to “come here with nothing after you 
promised a whole lot of s--t.”  Defendant, meanwhile, reported that he was “on the way 
with a 20 and a shooter.”  He noted that he was carrying two heavy bags.  The victim asked 
Defendant to bring her a beer, and Defendant stated that he had one beer and would try to 
get change to buy a second.  A few minutes later, the victim asked, “Well, d--n, how much 
longer?  You’ve been saying this for an hour and you’re going to smoke it before you get 
it.  So  what?”    Defendant  stated  that  he  was  waiting  on  a  bus,  then  stated  that  he  was 
walking  and  was  fifteen  to  seventeen  minutes  away.   The  victim  responded,  “More  BS. 
You were supposed to be walking an hour ago.  I’m giving you 15 minutes.  Do what you 
said, bring the shooter and a xany.”

At 7:43 p.m. on March 21, Defendant texted the victim, “Open door.”  Investigator 
Fuller agreed that the time corresponded to the time on the surveillance recording showing 
Defendant’s entering the victim’s room at the Chatt Inn.

Investigator  Fuller  testified  that  Defendant  subsequently  sent  text  messages  to 
19newcell1, which were as follows:  “This girl has fifty-dollar Eddie Bauer leather jacket 
and she says she’ll show you her boobs for a good rock . . . .  This red-headed girl wants to 
talk to you.  She works at th[at] ritzy cocktail bar, STIR, at the Choo-Choo.”  Defendant 
sent additional messages with similar content to 19newcell1, Latoya, and contacts labeled 
as “Tunnel Mike” and “Cash Taz.”  The messages ended at 10:28 p.m.  

On March 22, 2016, the next day, Defendant texted the victim at 7:05 p.m., asking 
if she was okay.4  On March 24, the same day the victim’s body was found, Defendant sent 
an email with the subject line, “Re: Position in Nashville.”  Defendant wrote,

                                           

4 Defendant also sent the victim a series of brief text messages during the day on March 22, some 
of which were only one word or letter.  All of the messages Defendant sent the victim on March 22 were

I don’t know if we can Skype an interview because of time constraints.  It 
would be impractical for me to travel just for the interview.  Is there going to 
be  a  small  relocation  package,  a  room  for  two  weeks  till  I  get  my  first 
paycheck?  I want the job and am ready to come there. I’m going to have to 
dedicate  a  whole  day  if  I  make  the  trip  for  an  interview,  and  that  is  very 
costly.  Respectfully, [Defendant].

Investigator Fuller testified that he and other members of the CPD violent crimes 
unit watched the surveillance recordings from the Chatt Inn.  He stated that he did not see 
anyone other than Defendant entering or exiting the victim’s room.

Investigator  Fuller  testified  that,  on  March  30,  2016,  Defendant  made  a  recorded 
statement.    An  audio  recording  was  played  for  the  jury,  which  reflected Defendant’s 
speaking  to  a  police  officer;  it  was  apparent  from  background  noise  that  they  were  in  a 
police cruiser.  The exchange was as follows:

[Defendant:]  I  was  just  living  at  the  wrong  place,  had  moved  out,  and 
something happened to somebody, evidently, where I had been living at, that 
lived  above  me  at  that  motel,  at  the  Chatt  Inn,  and  they  knew,  I  guess, 
evidently, that I may have known this person, or something, I . . . that’s all I 
can figure.  Just being one hundred with you, you know what I mean?  It’s 
not  no  mystery  at  this  point  why  they’re  going  through  all  this,  you  know 
what I mean?  

Well [cross-talk with the officer and what sounded like a police radio] 
I don’t know why they’re even taking me down here unless they’re trying to 
offer  me  some  kind  of  deal  for  me  to  make  a,  some  kind  of  statement  or 
something, you know what I mean?  All my mental health medication’s down 
here in my backpack, everything Joe Johnson gives me is down here in the 
[indecipherable] in my backpack.  I can’t even get them to call Joe Johnson 
here, the nurses won’t even give me an ibuprofen.  Hell, if they’d give me
one of my mental health medications out of each bottle, I’d almost be willing 
to  give  . . .  them  a  few  statements,  you  know  what  I  mean?    Just  so  I  felt 
normal.  My IDs and forty dollars of my money and put it on my darn books 
out of my wallet, I might tell them something.  

Now  I  know  something  I  can  tell  that’ll  help,  I  really  do,  I  know 
something  about  this  situation  that  would  really  help  to  lead  them  to  the 
person they really need to know about.  I do know something.  But they’re 

                                           
marked on the victim’s data report as having been received on March 24, 2016, and some of the messages 
were marked as “read.”  

- 19 -

not offering me anything, you know what I mean?  That’s a bargaining chip, 
you know what I mean?  They have it.  I know something, but not about what 
happened, but I know something about a person who was very close to the 
person that this thing happened to, you know what I mean?  This is probably 
the key person they need to be focused on in this investigation they got going, 
I know the person they need to focus on.  I can tell them who that is.  I can 
tell you that right now.  Straight up, I know the person they need to focus on.  
But . . . they weren’t trying to . . . I gave them some good information.  You 
heard what I said, didn’t you?  

[Officer:] Yeah 

[Defendant:] Opinion, I mean . . . nothing you say is going to be held against 
you,  obviously,  you  know  what  I  mean,  because  you’re  not  guilty  of 
anything, opinion, did I try to give them some good information?  I mean, 
without --    

[Officer:] Well, uh . . . I don’t know anything about the investigation, I’m not a part 
of it.

[Defendant:] But I mean I tried to tell them something, didn’t I, that would 
help them, I thought, didn’t I?

[Officer:] It’d be, uh, inappropriate for me to say.

[Defendant:]  God,  I  don’t  even  know  why  I  even  said  anything,  but  other 
than trying to—because they ain’t even gonna give me my money, I’m trying 
to give them some kind of direction to go on their investigation is all I was 
trying to do, you know what I mean?  If they would have come to me straight 
up and said look, we need your help and we’re not going to, you know, slam 
you  in  the  damn  jail  right  now,  you  know  what  I  mean?    If  they  had 
approached me in the right way different than they did, they would’ve got a 
whole different Mark Howard than they did the other day when they throwed 
[sic] me in that little room, that cold little room for five hours.

On cross-examination, Investigator Fuller testified that he requested TBI testing of 
evidence but  that  he  had  no  control  “of  what  they  determine  once it’s  up  there.”    He 
acknowledged  that  he  did  not  watch  all  seventy-two  hours  of  surveillance  footage.    He 
stated that he watched “a bunch of clips . . . of the second level catwalk . . . that would have 
covered [the  victim’s] room.”  He said that the video he watched was not in continuous 
order;  however,  he  acknowledged  his  preliminary  hearing  testimony  that  he  viewed 
segments in continuous order.  Investigator Fuller did not recall what he watched or the 

- 20 -

time  period  it  covered,  only  that  it  was  multiple  segments  of  video.    He  denied  having 
watched  the  surveillance  recordings  depicting  different  angles  around  the  Chatt  Inn 
property.  Investigator Fuller agreed that, in the compilation video played for the jury, the 
Chatt  Inn’s  lobby  had  a  flashing  light  in  the  window.    Investigator  Fuller  did  not  recall 
what the sign said.  He agreed that Defendant requested medication during his recorded 
statement.  He further agreed that, in the text messages, the victim asked for “hard” and a 
“shooter,”  which  Investigator  Fuller  knew  to  be  crack  cocaine  and  a  cocaine  smoking 
device.  

Investigator  Fuller  acknowledged  additional March  21 text  messages  from  the 
victim to Defendant, in which she told him to “man up” and “be a grown a-- man” when 
asking him to come over and bring drugs.  He also acknowledged March 21 text messages 
in which the victim offered to sell her leather jacket to an unidentified person for $40, as 
well  as  messages  from  the  victim  to  a  contact  labeled  as  “Lee”  seeking  cocaine.  
Investigator Fuller acknowledged that four of Defendant’s text messages on the victim’s 
cell phone report were received after Defendant left the victim’s hotel room and that they 
were marked “read.”

On  redirect  examination,  Investigator  Fuller  testified that  he  assigned portions  of 
the surveillance recordings to different officers.  He agreed that the officers were expected 
to report anything they observed on the recordings to him, that their observations would 
have  affected  his  investigation,  and  that  he  did  not  receive  any  such  reports  relating to 
anyone else’s entering or exiting the victim’s room.  He said that, to his understanding, the 
2,000 video clips were in chronological order.  

TBI Special Agent forensic scientist Marla Newport, an expert in forensic biology 
and serology, testified that she tested items from the victim’s hotel room, as well as known 
DNA standards from the victim, Defendant, and Mr. Adams.  Agent Newport tested a black 
nylon cord, a white telephone cord, a “rolling cord,” and a heater cord for DNA; she noted 
that the DNA of the person who tied the cords might have been found at their ends, and the 
DNA  of  the  person  who  was  bound  might  have  been  found  at  the  cords’  middles.    The 
nylon cord contained no DNA at the middle, and an insufficient amount of DNA at its end 
to be conclusive.  The end and middle of the telephone cord, as well as the end of the rolling 
machine cord, contained two DNA profiles, one of which was male and inconclusive; the 
other DNA profile matched the victim.  The middle of the rolling machine cord contained 
only  the  victim’s  DNA.    The  heater  cord  tested  negative  for  blood,  but  contained  three 
DNA profiles, one of which was male; Agent Newport stated that “due to the complexity 
of  the  mixture  and  the  unknown  number  of  potential  contributors,”  the  results  were 
inconclusive.  

Agent Newport testified that she also tested four plastic bottles of Milwaukee’s Best 
Ice beer, one plastic bottle of Brisk iced tea, one plastic bottle of Powerade, and one can of 

- 21 -

Bud  Ice  beer.    The  can  contained  at  least  two  DNA  profiles,  one  of  which  matched 
Defendant,  and  one  of  which  matched  the  victim.    The  iced  tea  bottle  also  contained 
Defendant’s DNA, as well as a DNA profile  for which the victim and Mr. Adams were 
excluded as contributors.

Agent Newport testified that the victim’s clothing tested negative for semen.  She 
stated that the sock the victim was wearing tested positive for blood; the blood, which was 
on the toe of the sock, matched the victim’s DNA.  Agent Newport also swabbed the inside 
of the sock and determined that the victim’s DNA and an inconclusive male profile were 
present.    The  victim’s  tank  top  tested  positive  for  blood;  a  blood  stain  on  the  shoulder 
matched the victim’s DNA, and a blood stain on the lower back contained a mixture of the 
victim’s DNA and an inconclusive contributor.  The victim’s sweatshirt tested positive for 
blood at multiple locations, all of which matched the victim’s DNA.  Agent Newport noted 
that an “additional allele was obtained at one of the loci” and that an inconclusive profile 
with “no indication of a male individual” was obtained on the lower back of the sweatshirt.  
Agent Newport stated that the victim’s dress tested positive for spermatozoa and contained 
a “limited DNA profile of at least two individuals,” one of which was male, and that the 
profile was inconclusive.  She noted that semen could last for years on fabric and that it 
was impossible to determine when the semen was deposited onto the dress.  

Agent Newport testified that the victim’s vaginal and oral swabs tested negative for 
semen.    Agent  Newport  stated  that  the  swabs  were  not  tested  for  DNA,  which  was 
consistent with TBI policy in 2016.  She noted that, although a rape kit commonly included 
an anal swab, the packaging of the victim’s oral and vaginal swabs indicated that no rape 
kit was submitted to the TBI.  Agent Newport stated that, if anal swabs had been collected 
after  an  individual  defecated,  the  swabs  would  only  have  reflected  the  victim’s  DNA 
“because  .  .  .  the  white  blood  cells  in  feces  .  .  .  would  have  overwhelmed  any  other 
contributor.”   

Agent Newport testified that one of the swabs taken from the hallway outside the 
victim’s room tested positive for blood with male DNA, but that Mr. Adams and Defendant 
were excluded as contributors.  She noted that no blood with a matching DNA profile was 
found  inside  the  victim’s  room,  and  she  agreed  that  no  reason  existed  to  believe  that  a 
suspect had been bleeding.  Agent Newport stated that, if Defendant was known to have 
been inside the victim’s room, it was unsurprising that Defendant’s DNA was found there; 
conversely, she said that the absence of DNA on some of the items tested did not indicate 
that Defendant was not inside the room.

On  cross-examination,  Agent  Newport  testified  that  the  unidentified  male 
corresponding to the hallway blood swab could have been inside the victim’s room.  She 
acknowledged that the unidentified male’s DNA profile was not entered into the Combined 
DNA Index System (CODIS).  Agent Newport agreed that, relative to the iced tea bottle 

- 22 -

and the beer can, her report’s conclusion that “[a]t least two individuals[’]” DNA profiles 
were present meant that it could have contained more than two people’s DNA.  She agreed 
that she tested a swab from the mouth of the bottle and can.  Agent Newport stated that the 
can contained the victim’s and Defendant’s DNA in addition to an allele that “could not be 
attributed  to”  either  of  them.    Agent Newport  agreed  that  the  victim’s  dress  contained 
sperm from an unknown person and an additional allele in the “nonsperm fraction.”  Agent 
Newport  stated  that  the  telephone  cord  contained  “multiple  extra  alleles.”    She 
acknowledged that she did not examine the base of the telephone or the receiver.     

Agent  Newport  testified  that  she  also  analyzed  fifty-five  cigarette  butts  from an 
ashtray in the victim’s room, three of which reflected only the victim’s DNA, one of which 
contained the victim’s DNA “with an additional allele,” and one of which was a mixture 
of the victim’s DNA and an inconclusive minor contributor.  Agent Newport agreed that a 
knife and a scalpel from the room were not examined.  She acknowledged that she did not 
receive swabs from the victim’s neck, wrists, anus, or ankles, or a sheet of paper for testing.  
She further agreed that no “toolmark analysis” was conducted to determine what may have 
cut the cords.  Agent Newport stated that she was not requested to do testing relative to 
fecal matter.

On  redirect  examination,  Agent  Newport  clarified  that  the  blood  swab  from  the 
hallway was ineligible to be entered into CODIS because it had not been connected to the 
victim’s  room  or  her  murder.    Agent  Newport  acknowledged  that  her  office  received a 
paper containing a brown substance, which was not examined or tested.  Agent Newport 
stated that she was unsurprised by extra alleles found on clothing; she noted that if clothing 
was laundered with other items, DNA could transfer to it.  Similarly, she was unsurprised 
to find extra alleles on a hotel landline telephone.  She could not determine when DNA had 
been deposited.      

Hamilton County deputy chief medical examiner Dr. Steven Cogswell, an expert in 
forensic pathology, testified that he conducted the victim’s autopsy.  He estimated that the 
victim died between one and a half and two and a half days before she was discovered.  Dr. 
Cogswell stated that the victim had no “significant” external injuries, that the victim’s body 
had cooled to room temperature, and that there was “some drying artifact that’s associated, 
probably, with the air conditioning blowing on.”  Dr. Cogswell noted that discoloration of 
the victim’s fingertips reflected the drying, which was a “postmortem change that [was] 
not an injury.”  He said that the victim had areas on her central forehead and above her 
right eyebrow that “were probably pre-existing abrasions that had been altered somewhat 
by insects[.]” Dr. Cogswell added that insects did not typically begin feeding on forehead 
skin, which was not soft or delicate; he opined that the insects chose the victim’s forehead 
because “it was wet for some reason, and that reason would be that she’s already got an 
abrasion  there,  the  skin  is  already  damaged  there[.]”    He  noted  that  “there  were  some 

- 23 -

impressions of a ligature around the left wrist.”  Dr. Cogswell elaborated that the skin was 
“dented in” and stated, 

These are an eighth of an inch apart and they run parallel to each other, which 
basically tells you that there is a single thin object . . . . And we’re getting 
these impressions at the margins of that object because that’s where the skin 
is stretched a bit.  On the back of the hand, back of the wrist, in that same 
area, we have . . . just above the base of the thumb, an abrasion.  And then as 
it extends upward, going toward the little finger side of the wrist, there’s also 
a small contusion.  

Dr.  Cogswell  noted  that  a  strap  or  ligature  had  been  around  the  wrist  with  “some  force 
applied” along the back of the arm; however, he also characterized the force required to 
cause the abrasion and bruise as “not a lot.”  Dr. Cogswell also found contusions to the 
knuckles of the right index and middle fingers, on the left hip, and the right groin area.  He 
opined that the ligature marks were caused by the victim’s pulling against the item wrapped 
around her wrist and that her right knuckles were bruised by an impact of some kind.  

Dr. Cogswell testified that the victim had had “an episode of diarrhea” that stained 
her buttocks, thighs, the panties placed on the victim, and some of the bedding, including 
the  pillow  upon  which  her  head  was  lying.  He  explained  that,  for  purposes  of  a  sexual 
assault examination, an anal swab would not have “pick[ed] up” useful evidence because 
“anything that’s there ha[d] now been flushed out[.]”  He noted that a release of the bowels 
was consistent with the dying process.  

Dr.  Cogswell  testified  that  his  internal  examination  revealed  two  areas  of 
hemorrhage  in  the  right  side  thyroidal  hyoid  and  omohyoid  muscles,  which  were  deep 
muscles in the victim’s neck.  He stated that “the superior horn” of the thyroid cartilage 
was broken and that some hemorrhaging occurred around it.  Dr. Cogswell explained that 
cartilage became more brittle as a person aged but that one would “have to produce a fair 
amount of force” to break cartilage in a thirty-year-old person’s body.  Dr. Cogswell noted 
that  the  injuries  occurred  before  the  victim’s  death  and  that  they  were  consistent  with 
manual strangulation.  Dr. Cogswell also observed petechial hemorrhages in the victim’s 
eyelids and eyes.  He opined that it was possible to create the neck injuries and petechiae 
using  one  or  two  hands.    Dr.  Cogswell  estimated  that  a  person  being  strangled  in  this 
manner would lose consciousness within thirty seconds and die within a couple of minutes.   
Dr. Cogswell concluded that the cause of death was strangulation, and the manner of death 
was homicide. 

Dr. Cogswell testified that he conducted a urinalysis, which reflected what drugs or 
alcohol  a  person  had  used  for  about  one  day  before  death,  and  that  he  sent  blood  for  a 
toxicology analysis.  The victim’s urine tested positive for cocaine, cocaine metabolites, 

- 24 -

and  marijuana  metabolites.    Her  blood  toxicology  tested  positive  for nicotine;  cocaine; 
cocaine metabolites; marijuana metabolites; alprazolam; gabapentin; and clonazepam.  Dr. 
Cogswell  noted  that  the  alprazolam  and  gabapentin  were  in  “low  to  therapeutic 
concentrations.”  The victim’s blood alcohol level was .107.

On cross-examination, Dr. Cogswell acknowledged that estimating a time of death 
was imprecise and depended upon many variables.  He stated that, if a struggle occurred, 
decomposition  would  begin  more  quickly  due  to  a  higher  amount  of  lactic  acid in  the 
victim’s muscles; conversely, having a smaller body or having air blown on the body would 
slow  decomposition.    He  agreed  that  the  drugs  in  the  victim’s  system  would  affect  the 
estimated time of death as well.

Dr. Cogswell testified that, because the victim died days before her body was found, 
it was impossible to determine whether she was under the influence of cocaine at her death, 
as opposed to having taken cocaine the day before.  Dr. Cogswell agreed that gabapentin 
was an “abused street drug.”  He did not take swabs of the victim’s neck, ankles, or wrist.

On  redirect  examination,  Dr.  Cogswell  testified  that  he  took  all  variables  into 
account when estimating the victim’s time of death for the autopsy report.  He stated that 
he did not take swabs from the victim’s neck because the evidence of strangulation was not 
apparent until he was conducting the internal examination, at which point the skin of the 
neck had been contaminated.  

After the close of the State’s evidence, Defendant presented proof. Bradleigh Dunn
testified that she was the general manager of the Bitter Alibi bar and had been a manager 
there since 2015.  She stated that, on a Monday night, the bar closed at midnight.  Ms. Dunn 
said that she was unfamiliar with the victim or this case.  

Jessica Finger, an investigator and office manager at the Hamilton County Public 
Defender’s  Office,  testified  that  she  was  assigned  to  Defendant’s  case  when  he  was 
represented by the Public Defender’s Office.  Ms. Finger reviewed the victim’s cell phone 
extraction  report  and  identified  a  photograph  from  the  report,  which  showed  a  bed  with 
bindings attached to the four corners of the bed.

Ms.  Finger  testified  that  she  also  reviewed  the  Chatt  Inn  surveillance  recordings.  
She stated that the copy of the recordings they received from the prosecutor did not initially 
function; she explained that “it was just a formatting system [issue].  It just took several 
attempts  to  try  to  get  a  playable  version[.]”    Ms.  Finger  stated  that  the  recording  was 
composed of 2,043 “very small clips” of different lengths covering a long period of time; 
she estimated that the clips were between three seconds and several minutes in length.  Ms. 
Finger said that the clips were not in sequential order and that she reviewed each clip to 
obtain the start and stop timestamp, which was to ensure that the entire seventy-two-hour 

- 25 -

period had been disclosed to the defense.  Ms. Finger composed a spreadsheet documenting 
gaps she found in the video.  She stated that she found the following gaps:  March 21, 2016, 
between 4:11 p.m. and 6:43 p.m.; March 22, 2016, at 10:59 p.m., for ten minutes, followed 
by another clip, then a second eight-minute gap; March 23, 2016, at 5:00 a.m., during which 
Ms. Finger counted twenty-seven gaps; and March 23 at 9:23 p.m., which had four gaps.  
Defense  counsel  played  assorted  clips,  which  he  described  by  the  number Ms.  Finger 
assigned to them in her spreadsheet.5

Ms.  Finger  testified  that  some  of  the  clips  ended  while  motion  was  occurring  on 
camera or, likewise, that some clips began when no motion was occurring.  She recalled 
one clip depicting no motion at all.  Ms. Finger stated that she did not review the clips for 
their content and that she did not pay attention to where people in the clips went.  

On cross-examination, Ms. Finger testified that she had no training in technology, 
that the clips provided to her were copies, and that she did not know if her computer settings 
might have accounted for the scrambled order of the clips.  She acknowledged that she did 
not work with the recording program and did not know how it was set to record.  Similarly, 
she did not know if clips ever existed for the gaps in time she found, only that she did not 
receive  them.    She  agreed  that  none  of  the  clips  played  for  the  jury  on  her  direct
examination  showed  individuals  entering  the  victim’s  room.    She  denied  seeing  anyone 
else entering the room during her review of the clips.     

The State recalled Mr. Hamilton as a rebuttal witness.  Mr. Hamilton testified that, 
based upon the varying sizes of the surveillance clips, the system was set to motion record 
and that the system would correctly contain gaps in the recording.  

Relative to the victim’s cell phone data extraction, Mr. Hamilton explained that he 
connected the phone to a computer and started the “logical” download process on March 
24, 2016, just before 8:17 p.m., the time the phone received the four text messages from 
Defendant marked as “read.”  Mr. Hamilton recalled that, after he connected the phone to 
power, the phone repeatedly beeped to indicate that messages were being received one at 
a time.  Mr. Hamilton noted that the LG was an “old flip phone[]” and that the messages 
were  not  received  until  the  LG  connected  to  the  network.    He  stated  that,  in  order  to 
navigate to the main screen, he may have had to exit from a text message alert, which could 
have marked the messages from Defendant as “read.”  Mr. Hamilton also stated that, in a 
circumstance when multiple messages were “stacked up” waiting to be read, reading one 
text message from a contact might also mark all messages from that contact as having been 
                                           

5 Relative  to  the  surveillance  footage,  the  trial  exhibits  contained  one  disc  with  thirty-seven 
individual clips and another with the compilation Mr. Hamilton produced for the jury.  The full 2,048 clips 
were not entered into evidence.  Likewise, the spreadsheet and video clips played at this juncture were not 
entered as an exhibit, and it is unclear from the record what the clips depicted.  We glean that at least some 
of the clips showed unidentified people walking through the frame.

- 26 -

read.  Mr. Hamilton said that a “physical” download of a phone’s data, which involved data 
extraction  by  a  software  program,  reflected  when  messages  from  that  phone  were  sent, 
whereas a “logical” download, which occurred by plugging the phone into a computer and 
selecting  messages,  video,  or  call  logs  to  download,  would  reflect  when  a  message  was 
received by that phone. 

Upon this evidence, the jury convicted Defendant of the lesser-included offense of 
second degree murder.  After a sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed a twenty-five-
year sentence.  After the court denied the motion for new trial, Defendant timely appealed.

Analysis

Defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to establish his identity as the 
person who killed the victim, arguing that  (1) “contrary to what the State’s witnesses told 
the jury,” the surveillance video was a continuous recording, and gaps existed in the video 
during the window in which the victim was killed; (2) the police did not watch the entire 
video; (3) Mr. Adams’ alibi was disproved because the bar in which he claimed to be at the 
time of the killing was closed; (4) Mr. Adams and the victim had previously engaged in 
bondage and choking during sex at the victim’s request; (5) on the night of the murder, the 
victim had  texted  several  people  offering  to  show  her  breasts  to  them  in  exchange  for 
cocaine; (6) the beer can and tea bottle in the hotel room contained third parties’ DNA in 
addition to that of the victim and Defendant; (7) text messages Defendant sent the victim 
after he left the hotel room were marked as read on the victim’s phone; and (8) the State 
failed to test sperm found on the victim’s dress and blood found outside the hotel room. 
The State responds that the evidence is sufficient.

Our standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence challenge is “whether, after 
viewing the evidence in the light  most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of 
fact  could  have  found  the  essential  elements  of  the  crime  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.” 
Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979) (emphasis in original); see also Tenn. R. 
App. P. 13(e).  Questions of fact, the credibility of witnesses, and weight of the evidence 
are resolved by the fact finder.  State v. Bland, 958 S.W.2d 651, 659 (Tenn. 1997).  This 
court will not reweigh the evidence.  Id.  Our standard of review “is the same whether the 
conviction is based upon direct or circumstantial evidence.”  State v. Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d 
370,  379  (Tenn.  2011)  (quoting  State  v.  Hanson,  279  S.W.3d  265,  275  (Tenn.  2009)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted).

A  guilty  verdict  removes  the  presumption  of  innocence,  replacing  it  with  a 
presumption of  guilt.  Bland, 958  S.W.2d at 659; State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 
(Tenn.  1982).    The  defendant  bears  the  burden  of  proving  why  the  evidence  was 
insufficient to support the conviction.  Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 659; Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d at 
914.  On appeal, the “State must be afforded the strongest legitimate view of the evidence 

- 27 -

and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom.”  State v. Vasques, 221 S.W.3d 
514, 521 (Tenn. 2007). 

Second degree murder is “[a] knowing killing of another[.]”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-
13-210(a)(1) (2018).  Second degree murder is a “result of conduct” offense.  See State v. 
Brown, 311 S.W.3d 422, 431-32 (Tenn. 2010); State v. Ducker, 27 S.W.3d 889, 896 (Tenn. 
2000).  Accordingly,  the  appropriate  statutory  definition  of  “knowing”  in  the  context  of 
second degree murder is as follows: “A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of 
the  person’s  conduct  when  the  person  is  aware  that the  conduct  is  reasonably  certain  to 
cause the result.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-11-302(b) (2018).  In other words, “[t]he State is 
not required to prove that the defendant wished to cause his victim’s death but only that 
the defendant knew that his or her actions were reasonably certain to cause the victim’s 
death.”  Brown, 311 S.W.3d at 432.

The identity of the perpetrator is “an essential element of any crime.”  State v. Rice, 
184 S.W.3d  646,  662  (Tenn.  2006).  Identity  may  be  established  with  circumstantial 
evidence alone, and the “jury decides the weight to be given to circumstantial evidence, 
and [t]he inferences to be drawn from such evidence . . . .”  Id. (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  The question of identity is a question of fact left to the trier of fact to resolve.
State v. Crawford, 635 S.W.2d 704, 705 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1982).

Viewing  the  evidence  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the  State,  the  evidence  was 
sufficient for a rational juror to find that Defendant knowingly  killed the  victim.  In the 
days preceding the victim’s death, she and Defendant exchanged text messages indicating 
that Defendant wanted a romantic or sexual relationship with the victim, which she did not 
reciprocate, and  that  he  “c[a]me  on  really  strong”  when  he  was  in  the  victim’s  room.  
Despite Defendant’s objections that he had treated the victim respectfully, he referred to 
the victim in text messages to third parties as his “girl” and asked for help obtaining drugs 
so  that  he  could  have  sex  with  her.    The  Chatt  Inn’s  surveillance  recordings  showed 
Defendant entering the victim’s room early in the evening on March 21, 2016, and leaving 
shortly  before  6:00  a.m.  on  March  22,  2016.    Defendant’s  DNA  was  present  on  drink 
containers in the room.  Investigator Fuller testified that he directed officers to review all 
of the surveillance footage between the time Defendant left and when the victim’s body 
was found and that no one was seen entering or leaving the victim’s room after Defendant’s 
departure.

On the morning of March 22, Ms. Combs encountered Defendant at the bus stop, 
and she testified that he was acting more nervous than usual, falling asleep mid-sentence, 
and  repeatedly  talking  about  the  victim’s  acting  “crazy”  and  asking  him  to  leave.    Ms. 
Combs  noted  that  Defendant  had  always  held  the  victim  in  high  esteem  and  had  never 
discussed her in this manner before.  Defendant texted the victim on the evening of March 

- 28 -

22, asking if she was ok.  He also emailed a prospective employer in Nashville on March 
24, inquiring about whether they could pay for him to move immediately for the position.

The medical examiner estimated that the  victim died between one and a half and 
two and a half days before she was found on the morning of March 24.  The victim died of 
manual strangulation caused by at least a couple of minutes of significant pressure to her 
neck; she was undressed from the waist down; she had been restrained by her left wrist and 
had pulled against the restraint with enough force to cause ligature marks, an abrasion, and 
a bruise; her right middle and ring fingers had bruised knuckles; she had two abrasions on 
her  forehead;  and  she  had  bruises  to  her  left hip  and  right  groin  area.    Nylon  cords  and 
electric cords cut from appliances in the room had been tied together, and the victim’s foot 
appeared to have been tied to a chair using a pillowcase.  The victim’s cell phone did not 
send  any  text  messages  or  make  calls  after  Defendant  left  her  room,  and  the  police 
discovered that the cell phone’s battery had been removed and that the battery compartment 
had been damaged.  

We note that several of Defendant’s contentions in his brief are factually incorrect—
Investigator Fuller testified that he assigned portions of the lengthy surveillance recording 
to different officers for review;  Mr. Adams testified that he never used restraints on the 
victim or applied pressure to her neck during sex; Defendant, not the victim, texted multiple 
people stating that the victim would show them her breasts in exchange for cocaine; and 
the TBI tested the sperm on the victim’s dress and the blood found outside the hotel room, 
but the DNA sample was either insufficient to make a conclusive profile (the sperm), or 
unconnected to the victim’s room (the blood).  Nevertheless, all of Defendant’s sufficiency
arguments relate to the weight of the evidence and witness credibility.  Defense counsel 
thoroughly cross-examined the State’s witnesses regarding each of the pieces of evidence 
listed on appeal, and the jury, by its verdict, elected to credit the State’s theory of guilt.  
We  note  that  the  jury  convicted  Defendant  of  a  lesser-included  offense.    It  is  not  the 
purview  of  this  court  to  reweigh  evidence  or  substitute  our  judgment  for  that  of  the 
factfinder.  See Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 659.  Defendant is not entitled to relief on this basis. 

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
