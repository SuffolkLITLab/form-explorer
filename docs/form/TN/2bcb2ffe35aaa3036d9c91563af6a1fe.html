      <pre>IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT KNOXVILLE
January 24, 2023 Session

STATE OF TENNESSEE v. KRISTOPHER JOHNSON

Appeal from the Criminal Court for Knox County
No. 114786    Steven W. Sword, Judge

No. E2022-00302-CCA-R3-CD

The Defendant, Kristopher Johnson, was convicted by a Knox County Criminal Court jury 
of two counts of facilitation of first degree felony murder, a Class A felony; two counts of 
criminally negligent homicide, a Class E felony; two counts of aggravated robbery, a Class 
B felony;  tampering  with  evidence,  a  Class C felony;  aggravated  burglary,  a  Class  C
felony;  and  aggravated  assault,  a  Class  C felony.    See  T.C.A.  §§  39-11-403  (2018) 
(facilitation), 39-13-202(a)(2) (2018) (subsequently amended) (first degree felony murder), 
39-13-212(a)  (2018)  (criminally  negligent  homicide),  39-13-402 (2018) (aggravated 
robbery), 39-16-503  (2018)  (tampering  with  evidence),  39-14-403  (2018)  (repealed  and 
replaced by § 39-13-1003) (aggravated burglary), 39-13-102 (Supp. 2017) (subsequently 
amended)  (aggravated  assault).  The  court  merged  the  criminally  negligent  homicide 
convictions  with  the  facilitation  of  first  degree felony  murder  convictions.    The  court 
sentenced the Defendant, a Range II offender, to thirty years for each of the counts of the 
facilitation of first degree felony murder, eighteen years at 85% for each of the counts of 
aggravated  robbery,  ten  years  for  tampering  with  evidence,  ten  years  for  aggravated 
burglary,  and  ten  years  for  aggravated  assault.   The  court  imposed  partially  consecutive 
sentencing, with an effective sentence of seventy years.  On appeal, the Defendant contends 
that: (1) the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions for the homicide and robbery 
offenses, (2) the court erred in allowing the State to introduce evidence of the Defendant’s 
street  gang  affiliation,  (3)  he was  denied  his  fundamental  right  to  cross-examine  two 
witnesses, (4) the court erred in ruling that a witness’s statement was hearsay, (5) the court 
erred  in  determining  that  no  violation  of  Tennessee  Rule  of  Evidence  615  regarding 
sequestration of witnesses occurred, (6) cumulative trial errors require reversal, and (7) the 
court erred in its application of a sentencing enhancement factor.  We affirm the judgments 
of the trial court.

General; Charme P. Allen, District Attorney General; Nathaniel R. Ogle, Assistant District 
Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.

OPINION

The Defendant’s convictions relate to a June 22, 2017 incident in which Rico Cook
shot Sergio  Rivera,  Jaolen  Morris,  and  Damon  Albert during  a purported marijuana
transaction which was, in fact, a robbery.  Mr. Rivera and Mr. Morris, both age eighteen,
died from their injuries.  Mr. Albert, then age sixteen, was injured.  The State’s theory at 
the  trial  was  that  Mr.  Cook  acted  at  the  Defendant’s  direction,  that Deon  Nolbert
participated in the robbery, and that the Defendant committed additional offenses after Mr. 
Cook shot the victims.  

The Defendant, Rico Cook, and Deon Nolbert were charged with various offenses 
related to the incident.  Mr. Cook and Mr. Nolbert were juveniles at the time of the incident, 
although  they  were  eventually  transferred  to  Criminal  Court  for  prosecution.    The 
Defendant was an adult at the time of the offenses.  In a separate proceeding, Mr. Cook 
was  convicted  of  two  counts  of  first  degree felony  murder  and  other  offenses,  and  his 
convictions were affirmed on appeal.  See State v. Rico Cook, No. E2020-01494-CCA-R3-
CD, 2022 WL 353701, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 7, 2022), perm. app. denied (Tenn. 
June 8, 2022).   As part of a plea agreement, Mr. Nolbert agreed to cooperate with the State 
and testified at Mr. Cook’s trial, after which he pleaded guilty to two counts of facilitation 
of  first  degree murder and  to  facilitation  of  attempted  first  degree  murder,  which  were 
lesser-included  offenses  of  some  of  the  originally  charged  offenses,  and  the  remaining 
charges were dismissed.  As part of the plea agreement, Mr. Nolbert received assurances 
that  the  victims’  families  would  not  oppose  parole  and  that  the  State  would  write  a 
favorable  letter  to  the  parole  board  regarding  Mr.  Nolbert’s  cooperation  with  the 
prosecutions of Mr. Cook and the Defendant.  The Defendant was charged with two counts 
of first degree felony murder, two counts of first degree premeditated murder, attempted 
first degree premeditated murder, two counts of especially aggravated robbery, tampering 
with evidence, aggravated burglary, and aggravated assault.

At  the  Defendant’s  trial,  the  State’s  evidence  showed  that  Mr.  Rivera  and  Mr. 
Morris came from Michigan to Knoxville to visit Mr. Albert, who was Mr. Morris’s half-

-2-

brother.  Mr. Rivera and Mr. Morris brought marijuana with them and planned to sell it in 
Knoxville to finance their trip and activities.  Mr. Morris agreed to assist them and sent 
messages through a social media application to Laurissa Brockwell to inquire if she might 
want to purchase some of the marijuana.  Although Ms. Brockwell did not have the funds 
to make a purchase, she connected the victims with Mr. Nolbert.  After being introduced 
by Ms. Brockwell, Mr. Albert and Mr. Nolbert exchanged social media messages and spoke 
by telephone, and Mr. Nolbert agreed to purchase ten grams of marijuana from the larger 
quantity that Mr. Rivera and Mr. Morris possessed.  After negotiation over the location for 
the  transaction,  the  victims  drove  into  the  parking  lot  of  the  Montgomery  Village 
neighborhood, where Mr. Cook and Mr. Nolbert approached the car and the Defendant sat 
on the porch of an apartment facing the parking lot.  Mr. Nolbert stood outside the front 
passenger door and spoke with Mr. Morris, who was seated inside the car with the other 
victims.  Mr. Cook entered the backseat of the car.  As Mr. Rivera was about to give the 
marijuana  to  Mr.  Cook,  Mr.  Cook  fired  several  shots,  striking  each  of  the  victims.    Mr. 
Cook took marijuana from Mr. Rivera’s hand and got out of the car.

Mr. Nolbert testified that on June 22, 2017, he was a high school student who lived 
in East Knoxville with his grandmother but that he had been staying with his girlfriend at 
her family’s home in Montgomery Village in South Knoxville.  He identified Mr. Cook as 
his  girlfriend’s  younger  brother.    Mr.  Nolbert  said  that he knew  the  Defendant  from 
Montgomery Village and that the Defendant’s nickname was “Money.”  Mr. Nolbert said 
that he knew the Defendant was in the  “60s,” which was affiliated with the  Crips street 
gang, based upon a statement the Defendant made in Mr. Nolbert’s presence and upon the 
Defendant’s reputation in the community.  Mr. Nolbert said Mr. Cook was known to be the 
Defendant’s “do-boy.”  Mr. Nolbert explained that this term meant, “Send him out, tell him 
to do something, he’ll do something,” referring to criminal activity.

Mr.  Nolbert  said  that  on  June  22,  2017,  he  received  a  message  through  a social 
media application from Larissa Brockwell, who inquired if he was interested in purchasing 
marijuana.    He  said  that  Mr.  Cook  was  present  during  his  message  exchanges  with  Ms. 
Brockwell.  Mr. Nolbert said that Ms. Brockwell connected him with the person selling
marijuana,  Mr.  Albert, and  that Mr.  Nolbert  and  Mr.  Albert exchanged  messages.    Mr. 
Nolbert said that Mr. Cook spoke by telephone with Mr. Albert about the transaction and 
that Mr. Cook had counterfeit $100 bills, which Mr. Nolbert and Mr. Cook intended to use 
to “purchase” one ounce of marijuana from the victims.  Mr. Nolbert denied that he and 
Mr. Cook planned to “rob” the victims.

Mr. Nolbert testified that he had planned to go to the front entrance of Montgomery 
Village to get the marijuana from the victims but that after he saw a police car, he called 

-3-

Mr.  Albert  and  instructed  him  to  go  to  Parking  Lot  C  inside  Montgomery  Village.    Mr. 
Nolbert said that Mr. Albert stated that the victims would not sell  marijuana to him and 
Mr. Cook unless one of them got into the victims’ car.

Mr. Nolbert testified that as he and Mr. Cook approached Lot C, the Defendant came 
from  the  opposite  direction.    Mr.  Nolbert  said  Mr.  Cook  ran  to  the  Defendant  and  said, 
“[H]e got a lick,” which Mr. Nolbert explained referred to a robbery.  Mr. Nolbert said that 
as they walked to a porch which faced Lot C, Mr. Cook and the Defendant whispered to 
each other and that when they reached the porch, Mr. Cook and the Defendant went inside 
the  apartment  for  about five  minutes  while  Mr.  Nolbert  and  others  present  remained 
outside.  Mr. Nolbert acknowledged that in previous testimony, he had said Mr. Cook and 
the  Defendant  had  a  private  conversation  on  the  sidewalk and  that  he  had  not  said  they 
went inside the apartment together.

Mr. Nolbert testified that when the victims’ car pulled into Lot C, Mr. Cook and the 
Defendant emerged from the apartment.  Mr. Nolbert said he saw the Defendant hand a 
gun to Mr. Cook, which Mr. Cook put in his pocket.  Mr. Nolbert said the Defendant sat 
on the porch and watched what transpired “like he was watching a movie.”  Mr. Nolbert 
said that he and Mr. Cook approached the victim’s car, that Mr. Nolbert stood outside the 
front passenger’s side talking to Mr. Morris, that Mr. Cook got into the back driver’s side, 
and  that  while  Mr.  Nolbert  talked  to  Mr.  Morris,  Mr.  Cook  took  out  the  gun  and  began 
firing  at  the  victims  while  saying  “b----”  each  time  he  pulled  the  trigger.    Mr.  Nolbert 
professed his surprise at the turn of events and stated that he had no reason to think this 
was  going  to  happen.    Mr.  Nolbert  denied  that  he  had  seen  anyone  struggling  for  the 
marijuana but later acknowledged he had seen Mr. Cook take the marijuana.  

Mr. Nolbert testified that he fled the parking lot on foot and that from a nearby field, 
he saw Mr. Cook give the gun to the Defendant.  Mr. Nolbert denied seeing Mr. Cook give 
anything else to the Defendant.  However, he later said he had seen Mr. Cook give a gun 
and marijuana to the Defendant.

Mr. Nolbert testified that Mr. Cook’s girlfriend drove Mr. Nolbert and Mr. Cook to 
another part of town immediately after the incident and that during the ride, Mr. Nolbert 
asked Mr. Cook, “What the f--- was that?”  Mr. Nolbert said Mr. Cook stated, “I sprayed 
they a--,” and “I’m about to be Crip.”

Mr. Nolbert testified that he had talked to the police voluntarily and that, initially, 
he had been untruthful with them about the incident.   He said he had been scared.  He said 
he told Detective Loeffler that Mr. Cook was a “hot boy,” which he said was the same thing 

-4-

as a do-boy.  Mr. Nolbert said that he knew Mr. Cook robbed people and that he had been 
present a couple of times when Mr. Cook committed robberies.

Courtney Walker, a Montgomery Village resident, testified that on June 22, 2017, 
she knew the Defendant as someone she saw spending time “across the parking lot.”  She 
said that she knew him as someone who had dated a person she knew but that he did not 
“hang  out”  at  her  apartment.    She  said  that  on  June  22,  she  was  cleaning  her  apartment 
when she heard gunshots coming from Lot C, which faced the back of her apartment.  She 
said her friend, Amanda Pride, was also in her apartment at the time.  Ms. Walker said that 
she was concerned about her children, who were at a vacation Bible school program nearby, 
and that she looked outside her back door and then went out her front door to investigate.  
Ms. Walker said she saw a “white guy” screaming, bleeding, and holding his face.  She 
said she saw the Defendant, Mr. Cook, and Mr. Nolbert, all of whom were “running around 
the  back  side  over  there  where  the  fence  was.”    She  later  stated  that  she had  testified 
previously that she did not recall seeing Mr. Nolbert but that she knew he had been there.  
She  also  acknowledged  that  in  her  previous  testimony,  she  had  said  she  had  seen  the 
Defendant running but that she had not seen anyone else running.

Ms. Walker testified that she went inside her apartment and that the Defendant was 
“right there.”  She said that he was not welcome in her apartment and that she told him to 
get out.  She said he pointed a gun at her and stated that he was not leaving.  Ms. Walker 
said the Defendant instructed Ms. Pride and her to close the door.  Ms. Walker said she did 
not want trouble in her apartment because she was on probation.  She later acknowledged 
that she was on probation for fraudulent use of a credit card.  She said that she asked the 
Defendant why he did not go to his mother’s house because she lived nearby and that the 
Defendant said he did not want to go there because his niece lived there.  Ms. Walker said 
she  told  him  that  her  children  were  in  her  house,  although  she  acknowledged  in  her 
testimony that they had not been home at the time.  

Ms. Walker testified that the Defendant took a chair upstairs and that she and Ms. 
Pride left the apartment.  Ms. Walker said she went to the apartment complex’s office to 
report the Defendant’s armed intrusion.  Ms. Walker stated that she did not have a gun in 
her attic.

Ms. Walker testified that she was taken to the police station for an interview, that 
she had seen a news report about the Defendant’s having been brought out of her apartment, 
and that when she returned home, she had smelled marijuana in her apartment, even though 
she did not smoke it.  

-5-

Ms. Walker testified that the Defendant arrived at her apartment shortly after she 
returned home from the police station.  She said he had worn Ms. Pride’s pants when he 
returned and that he asked Ms. Pride and her what they had said to the police.  Ms. Walker 
said the Defendant “flew up the stairs” and came back downstairs with a rolled up pair of 
pants and marijuana.  She acknowledged that in prior testimony, she had said she had not 
seen the Defendant with marijuana when he came downstairs.

Amanda Pride testified that she knew the Defendant, whom she knew as “Money,” 
from her friend, Ms. Walker’s, neighborhood.   Ms. Walker said she also knew Mr. Cook
as  someone  who  “[ran]  around  with  the  rest  of  the  kids”  in  the  neighborhood.    She 
described  Mr.  Cook  as  someone  who  “was  a  decent  person  until  he  got  around  other 
people.”  Ms. Walker said that Mr. Cook “acted like he looked up to” the Defendant and 
that Mr. Cook and the Defendant “were just really close.”  She said the Defendant and Mr. 
Cook occasionally would  “stop through” Ms. Walker’s apartment, where Ms. Pride was 
living on June 22, 2017.  Ms. Pride said that she knew the Defendant was in the Crips gang 
because of statements the Defendant made and because “they always throw up their sets.”  

Ms. Pride testified that on the morning of June 22, 2017, the Defendant had come 
to  Ms.  Walker’s  apartment,  which  Ms.  Pride  described  as  unusual.    Ms.  Pride  said  that 
although the Defendant used to come to the apartment when he had dated a friend of Ms. 
Pride’s, there had been no reason for him to come to the apartment on the morning of June 
22.  She said the Defendant’s demeanor “wasn’t like normal.”  She said, “[W]e all kind of 
felt something was going to happen, but we just didn’t know what.”  Ms. Pride said that 
Ms.  Walker  inquired  what  was  “going  on” and  that  Ms.  Pride  “knew  some  weed  was 
coming,” although Ms. Pride professed not to remember further details. She described the 
Defendant as restless and said that when he left, he said he was going to the “next parking 
lot.”  She said that she knew Mr. Cook was “over there” and that the Defendant needed to 
go there because Mr. Cook was there and because “there was somebody coming.”  

Ms. Pride testified that as she and Ms. Walker performed household tasks, Ms. Pride 
heard gunshots and that Ms. Walker came downstairs.  Ms. Pride said that the Defendant 
“[came]  flying  through  the  [back]  door.”    She  said  this  was  not  “cool”  because  Ms. 
Walker’s children were in the house. Ms. Pride said she saw two other people she did not 
recognize  run  past  the  door.  Ms.  Pride  said  that  she  and  Ms.  Walker  tried  to  get  the 
Defendant to leave, that Ms. Walker and the Defendant argued, and that he “was going off 
on” Ms. Walker.  Ms. Pride said the Defendant had a gun when he argued with Ms. Walker.  
Ms. Pride stated that the Defendant was out of breath, that he paced, and that “you could 
tell something wasn’t right.”  She said that the Defendant went upstairs and that she and 
Ms. Walker left the apartment with Ms. Walker’s children.  Ms. Pride said she tried to get 

-6-

a  male friend  to  convince  the  Defendant  to  leave  the  apartment  but  that  the  Defendant 
stated he would leave when he wanted to leave.  She said the Defendant stated he would 
leave after changing clothes.  Ms. Pride said that she later saw the Defendant surrender to 
the police outside the apartment and that he was wearing a pair of her pants.  

Regarding a statement Ms. Pride made previously to Ms. Walker about Mr. Cook’s
“earning his stars and stripes,” Ms. Pride testified that she had meant Mr. Cook had “done 
something that a person told him to do so he can move up the chart” in the Crips.  She said 
that both Mr. Cook and the person at whose instructions he had acted would “move up.”

Knoxville Police Department (KPD) officer Daryl Sexton testified that he received 
information from another officer that a man had entered a woman’s apartment and hid a 
gun in the attic.  He said he and other officers went to the apartment to do a “call out” for 
the man to come outside.  Other evidence  showed that the Defendant was the  man who 
emerged from the apartment, which was Ms. Walker’s apartment.

KPD crime scene technician Russell Whitfield testified that he went to an apartment 
in Montgomery Village on June 22, 2017, where he photographed a Glock nine-millimeter 
firearm lying on attic insulation.  He said the weapon was empty but was capable of holding 
ten rounds of ammunition.  

Knox County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO) Captain Steven Patrick, a records custodian 
of  the  jail’s  inmate  telephone  system  records and  internal  surveillance  footage,  testified 
regarding telephone calls, “video visits,” and surveillance footage related to the Defendant.  
Captain  Patrick  said  that  he  viewed  a  video  visit  made  about  six  days  earlier  from  an 
inmate’s  account  who  was  not  the  Defendant  but  that  Captain  Patrick  determined  by 
reviewing a recording of the call and the surveillance footage that the other inmate placed 
the call and then handed the receiver to the Defendant.  Captain Patrick said that computer 
analysis also determined “a high probability” existed that the inmate who spoke on the call 
was the Defendant.  A recording of the call was played for the jury, and in it, a male voice 
instructed the person on the other end of the call to tell “Shell” to tell “girl” that she heard 
the shot around 1:00 and that she saw the man “pick up the strap.”  Other evidence showed 
that a strap referred to a gun.

KPD  Detective  A.J.  Loeffler  testified  that  he  responded  to  the  scene  on  June  22, 
2017,  and  that  Mr.  Albert,  who  was  bleeding  from  his  head  and  face,  “gave  [Detective 
Loeffler] a name of Deon.”  Detective Loeffler said that Mr. Albert stated he had spoken 
with Deon by telephone and that after Mr. Albert gave Detective Loeffler the passcode to 
Mr.  Albert’s  cell  phone,  Detective  Loeffler  found  social  media  messages  between  Mr. 

-7-

Albert and Ms. Brockwell and between Mr. Albert and Deon Nolbert.  Detective Loeffler 
said  that  the  Defendant  was  taken  into  custody  after  emerging  from  Ms.  Walker’s 
apartment and that officers later found a gun in the apartment’s attic.  Detective Loeffler 
said that when the officers entered the apartment, they had not searched for marijuana.

Detective Loeffler testified that he interviewed the Defendant at the police station 
on June 22, 2017.  A recording of the interview was played for the jury.  In it, Detective 
Loeffler encouraged the Defendant to be forthcoming about the shooting incident because 
two young men were dead and another was injured.  Detective Loeffler told the Defendant 
that  the  Defendant  could  help  himself  and  that  other  people  would  not  be  there  for  the 
Defendant.  The Defendant waived his Miranda rights and agreed to speak to Detective 
Loeffler.  

In  his  statement,  the  Defendant  said  that  he  had  seen  what  had  happened  in  the 
shooting incident from his vantage point on a nearby porch where he sat with two other 
men.    The  Defendant  said  he  saw  “two  black  dudes”  walk  down  the  street  and  then 
approach a blue car that pulled up.  The Defendant said that a man in a white shirt stood 
outside the car and that a man with dreadlocks got into the backseat of the car and began 
firing gunshots.  The Defendant said he walked away.

Later in the statement, the Defendant identified “Rico” as the person who had fired 
the shots from the backseat of the car but claimed he did not know the identity of the man 
in the white shirt who stood outside the car.  The Defendant claimed he had not seen what 
kind of gun Rico had but stated it had not been a revolver.  The Defendant stated that Rico’s 
mother drove up and that Rico and the man in the white shirt left with her.  

When Detective Loeffler asked the Defendant during the interview if the gun that 
had  been  recovered  from  Ms.  Walker’s  apartment  had  been  used  in  the  shooting,  the 
Defendant  professed  no  knowledge  of  the  gun  at  the  apartment.    After  a  break  in  the 
interview,  the  Defendant  identified  Mr.  Cook  as  “Rico,”  the  person  who  had  been  the 
shooter, but he did not make an identification from a second lineup of the man in the white 
shirt.

As the interview continued, Detective Loeffler told the Defendant that he would be 
unable to help the Defendant if the Defendant were not truthful in the interview and the 
Defendant’s DNA was later identified on the gun from Ms. Walker’s apartment.  Detective 
Loeffler asked the Defendant if the Defendant had picked up the gun from the street after 
the shooting or if “that boy” had handed off the gun to the Defendant after the shooting.  
Detective  Loeffler said he could help the Defendant if the Defendant were truthful now.  

-8-

The Defendant continued to deny any involvement with the shooting and again claimed he 
had  not  known  about  the  gun  at  Ms.  Walker’s  apartment;  however,  the  Defendant 
eventually said Mr. Cook had discarded the gun “on the side” of a building and that the 
Defendant had picked it up and hid it in Ms. Walker’s attic because he wanted to keep it 
and “love[d] guns.”  The Defendant said that Mr. Cook had not asked him to hold or dispose 
of the gun and that the Defendant had not known the shooting was going to happen.  The 
Defendant again professed not to know the identity of the man in the white shirt.

Detective  Loeffler  testified that after  he  interviewed  the  Defendant, he  also 
interviewed  Mr.  Cook  and  Mr.  Nolbert.    Detective  Loeffler  said  that  at  the  end  of  the 
Defendant’s interview, he did not think the Defendant had been involved in the shooting 
incident.  Detective Loeffler said that the term “strap” was slang meaning a gun.  He said 
that Mr. Nolbert had been the first person to say that “they” got the gun from the Defendant.  
He agreed that Mr. Cook and Mr. Nolbert were charged first and that the Defendant was 
charged several months later, but before Mr. Cook’s trial.  

Two  stipulations  were  read  to  the  jury.    In  the  first,  the  parties  stipulated  that  if 
called as a witness, a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) agent, who was an expert 
in  firearms  identification,  would  testify  that  the  Glock  nine-millimeter  pistol  recovered 
from Ms. Walker’s apartment had been test fired and that the test-fired cartridge casings 
were consistent with several of the cartridge casings recovered from the victims’ car and
bullets from Mr. Morris’s body and that they had been fired from the same gun.  The parties 
stipulated,  as  well,  that  other  comparison  of  the  test-fired  cartridge  casings  and  the 
remaining  cartridge  casings  recovered  from  the  car  had  been  inconclusive  but  that  the 
remaining recovered cartridge casings had the same class characteristics as the test-fired 
cartridge casings.

The parties also stipulated that if a TBI agent, who was an expert in serology and 
DNA evidence, were called as a witness, she would testify that comparison of swabs of the 
Glock  nine-millimeter  weapon’s  pistol  grip  and  magazine  with  buccal  swabs  of  the 
Defendant, Mr. Nolbert, and Mr. Cook had been inconclusive.

Dr. Darinka Mileusnic-Polchan, an expert in forensic pathology, testified that Mr. 
Morris and Mr. Rivera both died from  multiple gunshot wounds and that the  manner of 
death for both was homicide.

The  Defendant  elected  not  to  present  evidence.    After  its  deliberations,  the  jury 
found the Defendant guilty of two counts of facilitation of first degree felony murder in the 
attempt  to  perpetrate  theft  for  the  homicides  of  Mr.  Morris  and  Mr.  Rivera,  as  lesser-

-9-

included  offenses  of  first  degree felony  murder;  two  counts  of  criminally  negligent 
homicide for the homicides of Mr. Morris and Mr. Rivera, as lesser-included offenses of 
first degree premeditated murder; two counts of aggravated robbery of Mr. Morris and Mr. 
Rivera,  as  lesser-included  offenses  of  especially  aggravated  robbery;  tampering  with 
evidence; aggravated burglary of Ms. Walker’s apartment; and aggravated assault of Ms. 
Walker.    The  jury  acquitted  the  Defendant  of  the  attempted  first  degree premeditated 
murder  of  Mr.  Albert. The  trial  court  merged  the  criminally  negligent  homicide 
convictions  with  the  facilitation  of  first  degree felony  murder  convictions.    The  court 
imposed an effective seventy-year sentence.  This appeal followed.  

I

Sufficiency of the Evidence

The Defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions 
for facilitation of felony murder, criminally negligent homicide, and aggravated robbery.  
He  does  not  challenge  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  to  support  his  convictions  for 
tampering  with  evidence,  aggravated  burglary,  and  aggravated  assault.    The  Defendant 
argues that the evidence failed to establish that (1) his conduct resulted in the death of Mr. 
Rivera  and  Mr.  Morris,  (2)  he  knowingly  furnished  substantial  assistance  in  the 
commission  of  the  offenses,  (3)  he  intended  to  promote  or  assist  Mr.  Cook  in  the 
commission of the offenses, (4) he acted with the intent to benefit in the proceeds or result 
of  the  offenses,  or  (5)  he  solicited,  directed,  aided,  or  attempted  to  aid  Mr.  Cook  in  the 
commission of the offenses.  The State counters that the evidence is sufficient to support 
the convictions.  We agree with the State.

In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, the standard of review is “whether, 
after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier 
of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); see State v. Vasques, 221 S.W.3d 514, 521 
(Tenn. 2007).  The State is “afforded the strongest legitimate view of the evidence and all 
reasonable  inferences”  from  that  evidence.  Vasques,  221  S.W.3d  at  521.  The  appellate 
courts do not “reweigh or reevaluate the evidence,” and questions regarding “the credibility 
of witnesses [and] the weight and value to be given the evidence . . . are resolved by the 
trier of fact.”  State v. Bland, 958 S.W.2d 651, 659 (Tenn. 1997); see State v. Sheffield, 676 
S.W.2d 542, 547 (Tenn. 1984).

-10-

“A  crime  may  be  established  by  direct  evidence,  circumstantial  evidence,  or  a 
combination of the two.” State v. Hall, 976 S.W.2d 121, 140 (Tenn. 1998); see State v. 
Sutton, 166 S.W.3d 686, 691 (Tenn. 2005).  “The standard of review ‘is the same whether 
the conviction is based upon direct or circumstantial evidence.’”  State v. Dorantes, 331 
S.W.3d  370,  379  (Tenn.  2011)  (quoting  State  v.  Hanson,  279  S.W.3d  265,  275  (Tenn. 
2009)).

A. Homicide Offenses

The  Defendant  was  convicted  of  facilitation  of  felony  murder  and  of  criminally 
negligent homicide related to the deaths of Mr. Rivera and Mr. Morris, and the convictions 
as to each victim were merged.  As defined at the time of the offense and as relevant here,
felony  murder  is  “[a]  killing  of  another  committed  in  the  perpetration  or  attempt  to 
perpetrate any . . . theft[.]”  T.C.A. § 39-13-202(a)(2) (2018) (subsequently amended).  “A 
person  is  criminally  responsible  for  the  facilitation  of  a  felony,  if,  knowing  that  another 
intends  to  commit  a  specific  felony,  but  without  the  intent  required  for  criminal 
responsibility under § 39-11-402(2), the person knowingly furnishes substantial assistance 
in the commission of the felony.”  Id. § 39-11-403 (2018).  “Criminally negligent conduct 
that results in death constitutes criminally negligent homicide.”  Id. § 39-13-212(a) (2018).  

‘Criminal negligence’ refers to a person who acts with criminal negligence 
with respect to the circumstances surrounding that person’s conduct or the 
result of that conduct when the person ought to be aware of a substantial and 
unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist or the result will occur.  The 
risk  must  be  of  such  a  nature  and  degree  that  the  failure  to  perceive  it 
constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person 
would  exercise  under  all  the  circumstances  as  viewed  from  the  accused 
person’s standpoint[.]

Id. § 39-11-106(4) (2018) (subsequently amended and renumbered).

Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence shows that Mr. Cook 
was  the  Defendant’s  “do-boy,” meaning  Mr.  Cook  engaged  in  criminal  activities  at  the 
Defendant’s direction.  Mr. Nolbert testified that he and Mr. Cook arranged to purchase 
marijuana from the victims, although they initially planned to use counterfeit $100 bills to 
complete  the  transaction.    As  Mr.  Nolbert  and  Mr.  Cook  walked  to  the  area  where  they 
planned to meet the victims, Mr. Cook ran to the Defendant and told the Defendant that 
Mr. Cook “got a lick,” which Mr. Nolbert said meant a robbery.  After being informed that 
Mr. Cook had an intended robbery target, the Defendant whispered with Mr. Cook before 

-11-

they disappeared inside an apartment alone together for about five  minutes.  When they 
emerged, the Defendant handed Mr. Cook a gun.  Mr. Cook and Mr. Nolbert approached 
the victims’ car, and once inside, Mr. Cook shot the victims and took marijuana from Mr. 
Rivera.  Mr. Cook got out of the car and took the gun and the marijuana to the Defendant 
before fleeing on foot.  The Defendant ran to Ms. Walker’s apartment, where he hid the 
gun in the attic and changed his pants before returning later in the evening to retrieve his 
pants and the marijuana.  After Mr. Cook shot the victims, he told Mr. Nolbert that he was 
about to become a member of the Crips street gang, and other evidence showed that the 
Defendant was a member of the gang and that the Defendant would attain higher status in 
the  gang  as  a  result  of  the  crimes.    From  this  evidence,  a  rational  jury  could  conclude 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant knew Mr. Cook intended to commit a theft, 
that the Defendant furnished substantial assistance to Mr. Cook in the commission of the 
theft, and that Mr. Cook killed Mr. Rivera and Mr. Morris in the perpetration of the theft.  
Likewise,  a  rational  jury  could  conclude  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  Defendant 
should  have  been  aware  of  a  substantial  and  unjustifiable  risk  that  Mr.  Rivera  and  Mr. 
Morris would be shot and killed with the gun the Defendant provided to Mr. Cook and that 
the  Defendant’s  providing  the  gun  to  Mr.  Cook  despite  this  known  risk  was  a  gross 
deviation  from  the  standard  of  care  that  an  ordinary  person  would  exercise  in  the 
circumstances.    We  conclude  that  the  evidence  is  sufficient  to  support  the  Defendant’s 
homicide convictions.

B. Aggravated Robbery

“Robbery is the intentional or knowing theft of property from the person of another 
by violence or putting the person in fear[.]”  Id. § 39-13-401 (2018).  The offense becomes 
aggravated robbery, inter alia, if it is “[a]ccomplished with a deadly weapon” or “[w]here 
the  victim  suffers  serious  bodily  injury.”    Id.  §  39-13-402(a)  (2018).
“Criminal 
responsibility, while not a separate crime, is an alternative theory under which the  State 
may  establish  guilt  based  upon  the  conduct  of  another.”    Dorantes,  331  S.W.3d  at 386 
(quoting State v. Lemacks, 996 S.W.2d 166, 170 (Tenn. 1999)).

A person is criminally responsible for an offense committed by the conduct 
of another, if: 

. . . 

(2) Acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense, or 
to benefit in the proceeds or results of the offense, the person solicits, directs, 
aids, or attempts to aid another person to commit the offense[.]

-12-

T.C.A. § 39-11-402(2) (2018).  For a defendant to be convicted of a crime under the theory 
of  criminal  responsibility,  the  “evidence  must  establish  that  the  defendant  in  some  way 
knowingly  and  voluntarily  shared  in  the  criminal  intent  of  the  crime  and  promoted  its 
commission.”    Dorantes,  331  S.W.3d  at  386;  see  State  v.  Maxey,  898  S.W.2d  756,  757 
(Tenn. Crim. App. 1994).  

Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence shows that Mr. Cook 
told the Defendant that he had an intended robbery target; that the Defendant and Mr. Cook 
spoke privately, after which the Defendant provided Mr. Cook with a gun; that Mr. Cook 
met with Mr. Rivera and Mr. Morris, during which time he fatally shot them and took the 
marijuana  that  they  had  planned  to  sell  to  Mr.  Cook.    After  the  incident,  Mr.  Cook 
immediately  went  to  the  Defendant  and  gave  him  the  gun  and  the  marijuana,  and  the 
Defendant hid the gun inside Ms. Walker’s apartment.  From this evidence, a rational jury 
could  conclude  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  Defendant  shared  in  Mr.  Cook’s 
criminal  intent  and  that  the  Defendant  promoted  the  commission  of  the  crimes.    See 
Dorantes,  331  S.W.3d  at  386.    The  evidence  is  sufficient  to  support  the  Defendant’s 
aggravated robbery convictions via a criminal responsibility theory.  The Defendant is not 
entitled to relief on this basis.

II

Evidentiary Rulings

The Defendant challenges several of the trial court’s evidentiary rulings regarding 

the admission and exclusion of evidence.  

A. Street Gang Evidence

The Defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the 
State to offer evidence that the Defendant was a member of the Crips street gang and that 
after the shooting, Mr. Cook stated that he was about to become a Crip.  The Defendant 
argues  that  this  evidence  was  inadmissible  character  evidence  which  was  barred  by 
Tennessee Rule of Evidence 404(b).  The State responds that the court properly admitted 
this evidence as probative of Mr. Cook’s motive in committing the homicides and robberies 
and of Mr. Cook’s connection to the Defendant.  We conclude that the court did not abuse 
its discretion in admitting the evidence.

-13-

Tennessee Rule of Evidence 404(b) prohibits the admission of evidence related to 
other crimes, wrongs, or acts offered to show a character trait in order to establish that a 
defendant  acted  in  conformity  with  the  trait.    Tenn.  R.  Evid.  404(b).    Such  evidence, 
though,  “may  .  .  .  be  admissible  for  other  purposes,”  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
establishing identity, motive, common scheme or plan, intent, or absence of mistake.  Id.;
see State v. McCary, 119 S.W.3d 226, 243 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003).  Before a trial court 
determines the admissibility of such evidence,

(1) The court upon request must hold a hearing outside the jury’s presence;

(2) The court must determine that a material issue exists other than conduct 
conforming with a character trait and must upon request state on the record 
the material issue, the ruling, and the reasons for admitting the evidence;

(3) The court must find proof of the other crime, wrong, or act to be clear and 
convincing; and 

(4) The court must exclude the evidence if its probative value is outweighed 
by the danger of unfair prejudice.   

Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b)(1)-(4).  The standard of review is for an abuse of discretion, provided 
a trial court substantially complied with the procedural requirements.  State v. Clark, 452 
S.W.3d 268, 287 (Tenn. 2014); State v. DuBose, 953 S.W.2d 649, 652 (Tenn. 1997); see 
State  v.  Electroplating,  Inc.,  990  S.W.2d  211  (Tenn.  Crim.  App.  1998).  An  abuse  of 
discretion occurs when a court “‘causes an injustice to the party challenging the decision 
by  (1)  applying  an  incorrect  legal  standard,  (2)  reaching  an  illogical  or  unreasonable 
decision,  or  (3)  basing  its  decision  on  a  clearly  erroneous  assessment  of  the  evidence.’”  
State v. Reynolds, 635 S.W.3d 893, 921 (Tenn. 2021) (quoting Lee Med., Inc. v. Beecher, 
312 S.W.3d 515, 524 (Tenn. 2010)).

As required by Rule 404(b), the trial court conducted a hearing on the Defendant’s
motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence of the Defendant’s membership in the Crips 
street gang and of Mr. Cook’s having committed offenses in order to become a member of 
the Crips.  At the hearing, Mr. Nolbert testified that the Defendant was in the Rollin’ 60s 
Crips  gang  and  that  Mr.  Cook  was  often  with  the  Defendant.    Mr.  Nolbert  said  the 
Defendant made statements in Mr. Nolbert’s presence which indicated that the Defendant 
was a gang member and that the Defendant had a reputation in the community as a gang 
member.  Mr. Nolbert agreed that Mr. Cook “was an underling” of the Defendant and that 
Mr.  Cook  “was  .  .  .  moving  out  in  the  community  and  in  the  neighborhood  at  [the 

-14-

Defendant’s] behest.”  Mr. Nolbert said Mr. Cook “was trying to be a member of the Crips.”  
Mr. Nolbert said that after the crimes in the present case, he was in a car with Mr. Cook 
and that Mr. Cook said he was “about to be Crip.”

Crediting Mr. Nolbert’s testimony, the trial court found that the State had shown by 
clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the  Defendant  made  statements  in  Mr.  Nolbert’s 
presence  about  being  a  Rollin’  60s  Crips  gang  member  and  that  the  Defendant  had  a 
reputation in the community as being a Rollin’ 60s Crips gang member.  The court found 
that  the  evidence  was  relevant  to  material  issues  other  than  conduct  conforming  with  a 
character trait.  The court stated that, “most importantly,” the evidence related to motive, 
in that the State theorized that the Defendant’s involvement in the crimes consisted of his 
directing Mr. Cook’s actions.  The court found, as well, that the evidence was probative of 
the  mens  rea  required  for  first  degree  premeditated  murder.    The  court  found  that  these 
issues were “highly, highly material” and were “the central issue[s] of the case.”  Further, 
the court found that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger 
of unfair prejudice.  The court ruled that Mr. Nolbert’s testimony, as well as the testimony 
of any other individuals with firsthand knowledge of the Defendant’s gang membership or 
of the Defendant’s reputation in the community as a gang member would be admissible.  
The court stated that it would give a limiting instruction at the time any such evidence was 
offered and again in its final jury instructions.

As we have stated above, Mr. Nolbert and Ms. Pride testified at the trial that they 
knew the Defendant was a member of the Rollin’ 60s Crips gang based upon his statements 
in their presence.  Ms. Pride also said she had seen the Defendant “throw[ing] up . . . sets” 
indicating his gang membership.  Mr. Nolbert testified, as well, that the Defendant had a 
reputation in the community as a Rollin’ 60s Crips member.

This court has recognized that evidence of gang membership is character evidence.  
See, e.g., State v. Cortez Lebron Sims, No. E2018-01268-CCA-R3-CD, 2020 WL 5088737, 
at *7 (Tenn. Crim.  App. Aug. 28, 2020), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Feb. 4. 2021).  That
said, both this court and our supreme court have held that gang membership evidence may 
be admissible for other purposes not related to propensity, as permitted by Rule 404(b).  
See Reynolds, 635 S.W.3d at 921; Cortez Lebron Sims, 2020 WL 5088737, at *7.

The Defendant acknowledges that the trial court followed the procedure required by 
Rule  404(b)  but  argues  that  its  findings  were  erroneous  regarding (1)  the  existence  of  a 
material issue other than conduct conforming with a character trait and (2) the probative 
value of the evidence outweighing the danger of unfair prejudice.  The Defendant asserts, 
“The State’s argument regarding [the Defendant] is essentially that he directed Mr. Cook 
to commit this offense in the same way that [the Defendant] was allegedly known to ‘run’ 
teenagers as a gang leader.”   The Defendant argues that this was evidence of conduct in 
conformity with a character trait and did not touch on a material issue. 

-15-

To the contrary, the record reflects the trial court’s finding that the Defendant’s gang 
membership and Mr. Cook’s aspiration to join the gang were relevant to show the motive 
for the offenses and to explain the Defendant’s involvement.  The jury could convict the 
Defendant  for  the  shootings  and  robberies  based  upon  theories of  direct  responsibility
through his own actions or of criminal responsibility for the conduct of Mr. Cook.  The 
gang  evidence  was  particularly  relevant  and  probative  to  show  the  relationship  between 
Mr. Cook and the Defendant and Mr. Cook’s  motive to commit the offenses in order to 
become  a  member  of  the  Defendant’s gang.    The  record  reflects  that  the  court  gave  a 
limiting  instruction  regarding  the  jury’s  consideration  of  this  evidence.    The  record 
supports the court’s ruling that the evidence was admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b), and 
the  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  admitting  it.    See  State  v.  Shasta  Jackson,  No. 
E2014-01387-CCA-R3-CD, 2015 WL 6756318, at *8-10 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 5, 2015) 
(holding  that  the  trial  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  admitting  evidence  of  the 
defendant’s “group” membership as probative of the common motive of the defendant and 
other group members and of the defendant’s criminal responsibility for the offenses), perm. 
app. denied (Tenn. May 5, 2016); see also Reynolds, 635 S.W.3d at 922 (holding that the 
trial  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  admitting  evidence  of  gang  membership  of  the 
defendant and others as relevant to prove a connection among them and to explain how the 
weapon used in the homicide could end up in a car owned by a gang member who had not 
been present on the night of the homicide, which was probative of identity and relevant as 
contextual  background  evidence); State  v.  Johnson,  743  S.W.2d  134,  158  (Tenn.  1987) 
(holding  that  the  trial  court  properly  admitted  evidence  of  the  defendant’s  gang 
membership as relevant to witness’s fear of the defendant and witness’s delay in reporting 
the homicide); State v. Stephen Donatae Lester, No. E2107-02154-CCA-R3-CD, 2018 WL 
6498700, at *10-13 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 10, 2018) (holding that the defendant’s gang 
membership  was  relevant  to  prove  identity  and  the  defendant’s  relationship  to  other 
involved parties), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Apr. 11, 2019).  The Defendant is not entitled 
to relief on this basis.

B. Evidence Related to Mr. Nolbert’s Plea Agreement and Sentencing

The Defendant contends that the trial court denied his fundamental constitutional 
right  to  cross-examine  witnesses  by  ruling that  he  could  not  cross-examine  Mr.  Nolbert 
and Detective Loeffler about the potential sentence Mr. Nolbert faced if Mr. Nolbert had 
been convicted at a jury trial and about the sentence Mr. Nolbert received as a result of his 
guilty plea and cooperation with the State.  The State responds that the court did not abuse 
its discretion by limiting cross-examination based upon Tennessee Code Annotated section 
40-35-201(b),  pertaining  to  the  prohibition  against  the  judge  instructing  or  attorneys 
commenting on the possible penalties for an offense and any lesser included offenses.  The 
State argues that no exception from the general purpose of section 40-35-201(b) should be 

-16-

permitted for attorneys to elicit this otherwise-prohibited information from the witnesses.  
We conclude that no abuse of discretion has been shown.

When  cross-examining  Mr.  Nolbert  during  the  State’s  case-in-chief,  defense 
counsel asked Mr. Nolbert about Mr. Nolbert’s decision to plead guilty and cooperate with 
the  State and about the  terms  of  the  agreement.   After the  State  objected,  the  trial  court 
ruled  that  defense  counsel  could  not  ask  Mr.  Nolbert  about  the  sentence  or  release 
eligibility  percentage  Mr.  Nolbert  would  have  faced  if  he  had  gone to  trial.    The  court 
permitted cross-examination about Mr. Nolbert’s eligibility for parole the upcoming year.  
The court reasoned that information about the sentence Mr. Nolbert faced if he had gone 
to trial was inadmissible because Mr. Nolbert had been charged with the same offenses as 
the  Defendant,  and  the  jury  was  not  permitted  to  know  the  possible  punishment  for  a 
defendant’s  charges.    Defense  counsel  cross-examined  Mr.  Nolbert  about  the  specific 
lesser-included  offenses  to  which  he  pleaded guilty, his  having  received  a  sentence  that 
was “significantly less” than what he faced if convicted of the charged offenses, and his 
having  avoided  the  possibility  of  consecutive  sentencing.    Counsel  also  questioned  Mr. 
Nolbert about the State’s agreement to write a favorable letter to the parole board and about 
the victims’ families’ agreement not to oppose parole.  

During the cross-examination of Detective Loeffler, the trial court ruled that defense 
counsel could not ask the witness what the witness had meant when he said, “This is going 
to save the rest of your life,” during the recorded interview.  The court stated its belief that 
the  defense  was  “wanting  to  get  in  the  fact  that  [Detective]  Loeffler  knew  it  was  a  life 
sentence you’re looking at” and ruled that the evidence regarding the witness’s meaning 
was inadmissible.

Evidence is relevant and generally admissible when it has “any tendency to make 
the  existence  of  any  fact  that  is  of  consequence  to  the  determination of the  action  more 
probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.”  Tenn. R. Evid. 401, 402. 
Relevant  evidence,  however,  “may  be  excluded  if  its  probative  value  is  substantially 
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the 
jury,  or  by  considerations  of  undue  delay,  waste  of  time,  or  needless  presentation  of 
cumulative evidence.”  Id. 403.

“The Sixth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 
clearly  guarantee  a  criminal  defendant  the  right  to  present  a  defense  which  includes  the 
right to present witnesses favorable to the defense.”  State v. Brown, 29 S.W.3d 427, 432 
(Tenn. 2000); see Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 119 (1967). Likewise, due process 
protects a criminal defendant’s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.  Chambers 
v.  Mississippi,  410  U.S.  284,  294  (1973);  see  Pennsylvania  v.  Ritchie,  480  U.S.  39,  51 
(1987); State v. Dishman, 915 S.W.2d 458, 463 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995).  “[A] denial of 
the  right  to  an  effective  cross-examination  is  ‘constitutional  error  of  the  first  magnitude 

-17-

and amounts to a violation of the basic right to a fair trial.’”  Dishman, 915 S.W.2d at 463 
(quoting State v. Hill, 598 S.W.2d 815, 819 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1980)).  “The propriety, 
scope, manner, and control of cross-examination of witnesses, however, remain within the 
discretion of the trial court.”  State v. Echols, 382 S.W.3d 266, 285 (Tenn. 2012).  In that 
regard, a court may limit cross-examination due to such factors as “harassment, prejudice, 
issue confusion, witness safety, or merely repetitive or marginally relevant interrogation.” 
State v. Reid, 882 S.W.2d 423, 430 (Tenn. 1994).

Our  supreme  court  has  said,  “[P]roof  suggesting  that  a  witness  received  or  had 
reason to expect leniency from the State typically constitutes relevant evidence of bias.”  
Echols, 382 S.W.3d at 285.  Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-201(b) provides:

In all contested criminal cases, except for capital crimes that are governed by 
the procedures contained in §§ 39-13-204 and 39-13-205, and as necessary 
to comply with the Tennessee Constitution, article VI, § 14 and § 40-35-301, 
the judge shall not instruct the jury, nor shall the attorneys be permitted to 
comment at any time to the jury, on possible penalties for the offense charged 
nor all lesser included offenses.

The  Defendant  argues  that  resolution  of  this  issue  is  controlled  by  our  supreme 
court’s decision in Echols, in which the trial court allowed the State to redact portions of 
the defendant’s recorded statement because the interviewing detective made references to 
the defendant’s either spending “the rest of [his] life” in prison or serving “a little bit of 
time,” depending on the defendant’s truthfulness in the interview.  See Echols, 382 S.W.3d 
at  287-88.    The  trial  court  in  Echols  did  not  allow  the  defendant  to  cross-examine  the 
detective who conducted the interview about the redactions, and the court based its decision
upon its earlier ruling that the confession had been given  voluntarily and upon the basis 
that  the  parties  were  “not  going  into  punishments”  in  accord  with  Code  section  40-35-
201(b).  Id. at 288.  The supreme court held that Code section 40-35-201(b) did not prohibit 
admission of a suspect’s statement made before the suspect was charged that the suspect 
could face a life sentence or a short sentence, depending on the content of the statement 
the suspect made.  See id.  The supreme court also held that the trial court had abused its 
discretion  in  limiting  cross-examination  of  the  detective  but  that  the  error  was  harmless 
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  because  the  jury  was  otherwise  aware,  in  considering  the 
truthfulness  of  the  defendant’s  statement,  that  the  interviewing  detective  had  used 
“interrogation  techniques  designed  to  elicit  an  incriminating  statement”  and  that  the 
Defendant’s statement had been consistent with his defense theory at the trial.  See id. at 
289.

In  the  present  case,  the  trial  court  distinguished  Echols on  the  basis  that  the 
defendant in that case sought to cross-examine the detective about the redacted statements 
the detective made to the defendant in order to address “why [the defendant] would give a 

-18-

statement.”    On the  other  hand,  the  trial  court  reasoned,  the  defense  in  the  present  case 
“want[ed] to  get  in  the  fact  that  [Detective]  Loeffler  knew  it  was  a  life  sentence  you’re 
looking at,” rather than any issue regarding the circumstances in which the statement was 
given.  The court was also concerned that because the Defendant was on trial for the same 
offenses  with  which  Mr.  Nolbert  was  originally  charged,  inquiry  into  the  sentencing 
consequences of Mr. Nolbert’s original charges would inform the jury of the sentencing 
consequences the Defendant faced, contrary to Code section 40-35-201(b).

We acknowledge our supreme court has said  that nothing in Code section 40-35-
201(b)  bars  cross-examination  about  whether  a  suspect  might  face  a  lengthy  or  short 
sentence, depending upon the information the suspect provided to the police.  See id. at 
288.  However,  a  defendant’s  constitutional  right  to  cross-examine  witnesses  remains 
subject to general rules of relevance and concerns such as presentation of cumulative or 
marginally relevant  information.    See Tenn.  R.  Evid.  403; Reid,  882  S.W.2d  at 430.  
Ultimately, “the Confrontation Clause only guarantees ‘an opportunity for effective cross-
examination,  not  cross-examination  that  is  effective  in  whatever  way,  and  to  whatever 
extent,  the  defense  might  wish.”    Delaware  v.  Fenstereer,  474  U.S.  15,  20  (1985);  see 
Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 53; State v. Rimmer, 623 S.W.3d 235, 290 (Tenn. 2021).

The jury in the present case heard the statements Detective  Loeffler made during 
the Defendant’s interview about possible punishments.  The defense was allowed to cross-
examine Mr. Nolbert about the offenses with which he had been charged and the offenses 
to  which  he  had  pleaded  guilty  pursuant  to  the  plea  agreement.    The  defense  was  also 
allowed to cross-examine Mr. Nolbert about his cooperation with the State and the fact that 
he had received a very favorable resolution to his case, as compared with the conviction 
and  sentencing  exposure  he  faced  if  he  had  been  convicted  at  a  jury  trial.    Any  further 
information  about  the  specific  sentence Mr.  Nolbert  received  as  a  result  of  his  plea 
agreement and the potential sentence he would have faced if he had been convicted at a 
jury trial was of minimal additional probative value in impeaching his credibility and in 
showing  any  bias  he  had  in  favor  of  the  State.   Given  the  facts  of  the  present  case,  we 
conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination of 
Mr.  Nolbert  about  further  specifics  of  his  actual  and  potential  sentences and  that  the 
Defendant was not deprived of due process by the court’s limits on cross-examination.

Regarding the propriety of the trial court’s ruling relative to cross-examination of 
Detective Loeffler, the court found that the defense’s purpose in asking Detective Loeffler 
what he meant by, “This is going to save the rest of your life,” was to inform the jury of 
the  possibility  of  a  life  sentence,  not  to  probe  the  voluntariness  of  the  Defendant’s 
statement.    The  record  reflects  that  defense  counsel  made  vigorous  attempts  to  cross-
examine Mr. Nolbert about the specifics of his actual and potential sentences and that cross-
examination  elicited  many  details,  the  most  significant  of  which  was  that  Mr.  Nolbert 
received a very favorable disposition of his case predicated upon his cooperation with the 

-19-

State in  the  prosecutions  of  Mr.  Cook  and  the  Defendant.   After  the  court  sustained  the 
State’s objections to defense counsel’s questions to Mr. Nolbert about the granular details 
of  the  actual  and  potential  sentences,  defense  counsel  later  sought  to  elicit  substantially 
similar information from Detective Loeffler.  The court was concerned that this question 
was designed to highlight the possibility of a life sentence.   Detective Loeffler’s statement 
itself was part of the evidence the jury heard, and it could infer from it that any cooperation 
Mr. Nolbert provided to the authorities would be to his advantage. Given that the statement 
itself was evidence the jury heard, Detective Loeffler’s subjective intent or “meaning” in 
making the statement was not relevant.  See Tenn. R. Evid. 401, 402.  The court did not 
abuse its discretion in sustaining the State’s objection to defense counsel’s question about 
Detective Loeffler’s meaning about Mr. Nolbert’s opportunity to “save [his] life,” and the 
Defendant’s right to due process was not violated by the court’s ruling.

C. Exclusion of Evidence of Any Alleged Benefit to Laurissa Brockwell from the 

Robbery

The Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding as hearsay Detective 
Loeffler’s prospective testimony that Ms. Brockwell, who did not testify, told Detective 
Loeffler  that  she  had  been  supposed  to  receive  a  portion  of  the  robbery  proceeds.    The 
Defendant  argues  on  appeal  that  the  evidence  was  admissible  under  Tennessee  Rule  of 
Evidence 803(3), the hearsay exception for evidence of the declarant’s then-existing state 
of mind.  The State responds that the Defendant has waived consideration of the evidence 
as admissible under Rule 803(3) because he did not assert this basis for admissibility in the 
trial court.  We agree with the State.

Hearsay “is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the 
trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.”  Tenn. R. 
Evid.  801(c).  Hearsay  is  inadmissible  unless  it  qualifies  as  an  exception.    Id.  at  802.  
Tennessee Rule of Evidence 803(3) provides:

Hearsay Exceptions. – The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule:

. . . .

(3) Then Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition. – A statement of the 
declarant’s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as 
intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a 
statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to 
the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant’s will.  

A trial court’s factual findings and credibility determinations relative to a hearsay 
issue are binding upon an appellate court unless the evidence preponderates against them.  

-20-

Kendrick v. State, 454 S.W.3d 450, 479 (Tenn. 2015).  The determination of whether the 
statement in question is hearsay and whether a hearsay exception applies are questions of 
law that are reviewed de novo.  Id.

At a bench conference during the trial, the defense argued that Dectective Loeffler 
should  be  permitted  to  testify  about  Ms.  Brockwell’s  purported  statement  to  Detective 
Loeffler that she was going to receive one-half of the robbery proceeds.  Defense counsel 
posited, “I think it goes toward motive and intent on behalf of Deon Nolbert.  If they’re
joined at the hip, you know, if they enter into this scheme together and she’s the one that 
connects him to these guys that are coming in.”  The trial court ruled that under this theory, 
the evidence was inadmissible hearsay because it would be introduced to prove the truth of 
the matter asserted.  The Defendant first asserted that the evidence was admissible under 
Rule 803(3) in his amended motion for a new trial.  It is well-settled that after advancing 
an unsuccessful theory of admissibility at the trial, a party may not thereafter advance an 
alternative theory in the motion for a new trial or on appeal.  See, e.g., State v. Vance, 596 
S.W.3d 229, 253 (Tenn. 2020) (citing State v. Adkisson, 899 S.W.2d 626, 634-35 (Tenn. 
Crim.  App.  1994);  State  v.  Howard,  504  S.W.3d  260,  277  (Tenn.  2016).    The  issue  is 
waived.

In  reaching  this  conclusion,  we  have  considered  the  Defendant’s  argument  in  his 
reply brief that the defense argued at the trial that questioning Detective Loeffler about Ms. 
Brockwell’s purported statement “would highlight ‘motive and intent of Deon Nolbert,’” 
and that “[r]ead alongside Tenn. R. Evid. 803(3), this argument by . . . trial counsel is a 
clear  and  unequivocal  invocation  of  the  exact  language  of  the  applicable  hearsay 
exception.”  The problem with the Defendant’s argument in this respect is that even if we 
were to accept this strained interpretation of the record, “only the declarant’s conduct, not 
some third party’s conduct, is provable by this hearsay exception.”  Tenn. R. Evid. 803(3) 
(Advisory  Comm’n  Cmts.). Thus,  the  Defendant’s  argument  is  that  Ms.  Brockwell’s 
statement is relevant and admissible evidence to show Mr. Nolbert’s state of mind.  The 
Advisory  Commission  Comments  demonstrate  the  fault  in  the  Defendant’s  theory  of 
admissibility.  

Finally, we have considered the Defendant’s argument in his reply brief that he was 
denied a fair trial by the trial court’s ruling.  Again, this issue is waived because it was not 
advanced in the trial court.  See Howard, 504 S.W.3d at 277.

The Defendant is not entitled to relief on this basis.

III

Sequestration of the Witnesses Pursuant to Tenn. R. Evid. 615

The  Defendant  contends  that  the  trial  court  failed  to  find  that  a  violation  of 
Tennessee Rule of Evidence 615 occurred and to impose sanctions.  The Defendant does 
not advocate that the court should have imposed any specific remedy and merely contends 
that the combined effect of this and other alleged trial errors deprived him of a fair trial. 
The  State  responds  that  the  court  did  not err in  determining  that  no  Rule  615  violation 
occurred and, therefore,  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  by  not  imposing  any  sanction  or 
remedy.  We agree with the state.

Rule 615 provides, in pertinent part:

At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses, including rebuttal 
witnesses,  excluded  at  trial  or  other  adjudicatory  hearing.
In  the  court’s 
discretion, the requested sequestration may be effective before voir dire, but 
in  any  event  shall  be  effective  before  opening  statements.  The  court  shall 
order all persons not to disclose by any means to excluded witnesses any live 
trial testimony or exhibits created in the courtroom by a witness.

If a trial court finds that a violation of the rule has occurred, the court has the discretion to 
impose a sanction or remedy tailored to the circumstances.  State v. Black, 75 S.W.3d 422, 
424 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001).  An appellate court will not revisit the issue in the absence 
of an abuse of discretion and prejudice to the complaining party.  Id. at 424-25.

The record reflects that after a lunch break in the trial proceedings, the court stated 
that an unidentified person had approached a member of the court’s staff and stated that 
Ms. Pride and Ms. Walker had discussed their testimony during the break.  Ms. Walker had 
already testified, and the lunch break took place in the middle of cross-examination of Ms. 
Pride.  

The trial court permitted the defense to offer evidence related to the allegation.  The 
defense  called  Michelle  Maxwell,  a  friend  of the  Defendant’s  family,  who  testified  that 
during  the  break,  she  had  seen  Ms.  Pride  and  Ms.  Walker  outside  the  courtroom.    Ms. 
Maxwell said that she saw Ms. Pride and Ms. Walker smoking and talking to each other 
but that she was unable to hear their conversation.  

The trial court called Ms. Pride as a witness, and she testified that during the break, 
she and Ms. Walker had not discussed Ms. Walker’s testimony.  Ms. Pride stated that she 
and  Ms.  Walker  had  been  upset  and  that  Ms.  Pride  was  “on  a  time  limit  at  home”  and 
needed  to  leave  court  promptly.    Ms.  Pride  said  that  Ms.  Walker  had  been  tearful  for  a 

-22-

reason that Ms. Pride did not know and that Ms. Pride told Ms. Walker, “[W]e can’t talk.”  
Ms. Pride said an unidentified man approached them and said they could not talk to each 
other.  When questioned further, Ms. Pride said,

Ms. Walker came out there, asked for a cigarette and was, like, calm down.
Stop  crying.  It’s  okay.  I  was,  like,  no, ‘cause  all  this  is,  like,  crazy.
It’s 
crazy.  It’s obvious what all happened.  And it’s crazy that everybody has to 
put their life back out there.

. . . .

I said, all this is crazy. We all don’t have to come back to court years later 
over this.  It’s all crazy.  No one discussed what was talked about in here. 
No one talked about what anyone else knows. 

After receiving the evidence, the trial court found that no violation of Rule 615 had 
occurred.    The  Defendant  has  not  articulated  any  prejudice  he  alleges  he  suffered  from 
these  facts,  and  none  is  apparent.    Likewise,  he  has  failed  to  articulate  any  remedy  he 
contends the court should have fashioned to address any purported prejudice.  Although 
the record reflects that Ms. Walker and Ms. Pride, who were friends, spoke to each other 
during the trial, the evidence does not preponderate against the court’s determination that 
no violation of Rule 615 occurred.  The court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief.  
The Defendant is not entitled to relief on this basis.

IV

Cumulative Error

The Defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the record reflects 
that  he  was  prejudiced  by  multiple  errors  which  occurred  during  the  trial.    The  State 
responds that the Defendant is not entitled to relief because he has not shown that multiple 
errors occurred during the trial, from which he suffered cumulative prejudice.  We agree 
with the State.

The cumulative error doctrine requires relief when “multiple errors [are] committed 
in  the  trial  proceedings,  each  of  which  in  isolation  constitutes  mere  harmless  error,  but 
which when aggregated, have a cumulative effect on the proceedings so great as to require 
reversal in order to preserve a defendant’s right to a fair trial.”  State v. Hester, 324 S.W.3d 
1, 76–77 (Tenn. 2010) (internal citations omitted); see State v. Jordan, 325 S.W.3d 1, 79 
(Tenn. 2010) (“‘[T]he combination of multiple errors may necessitate . . . reversal . . . even 
if individual errors do not require relief.’”) (quoting State v. Cribbs, 967 S.W.2d 773, 789 
(Tenn. 1998)).

-23-

We have rejected each of the Defendant’s allegations of trial error.  He is not entitled 

to relief on the basis of the prejudicial effect of multiple errors.

V

Sentencing

Finally,  the  Defendant  contends  that  the  trial  court  abused  its discretion  in 
sentencing him because it erroneously found that he was a leader in the commission of the 
offenses.  See T.C.A. § 40-35-114(2) (Supp. 2016) (subsequently amended). He challenges 
the application of this factor to the offenses involving Mr. Rivera and Mr. Morris.  The 
State responds that the record supports the application of the “leader in the commission of 
the offense” enhancement factor and that the court acted within its discretion in sentencing 
the Defendant.  We agree with the State.

This  court  reviews  challenges  to  the  length  of  a  sentence  within  the  appropriate 
sentence  range  “under  an  abuse  of  discretion  standard  with  a  ‘presumption  of 
reasonableness.’”    State  v.  Bise,  380  S.W.3d 682,  708  (Tenn.  2012).   A  trial  court  must 
consider any evidence received at the trial and sentencing hearing, the presentence report, 
the principles of sentencing, counsel’s arguments as to sentencing alternatives, the nature 
and  characteristics  of  the  criminal  conduct,  any  mitigating  or  statutory  enhancement 
factors, statistical information provided by the Administrative Office of the Courts as to 
sentencing  practices  for  similar  offenses  in  Tennessee,  any  statement  that  the  defendant 
made on his own behalf, the potential for rehabilitation or treatment, and the result of the 
validated risk and needs assessment.  T.C.A. §§ 40-35-103 (2019), -210 (2019); State v. 
Ashby,  823  S.W.2d  166,  168  (Tenn.  1991);  State  v.  Moss,  727  S.W.2d  229,  236  (Tenn. 
1986); State v. Taylor, 744 S.W.2d 919, 920 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987); see T.C.A. § 40-35-
102 (2019).

Likewise,  a  trial  court’s  application of  enhancement  and  mitigating  factors  are 
reviewed for an abuse of discretion with “a presumption of reasonableness to within-range 
sentencing decisions that reflect a proper application of the purposes and principles of our 
Sentencing  Act.”  Bise,  380  S.W.3d  at  707.    “[A]  trial  court’s  misapplication  of  an 
enhancement or mitigating factor does not invalidate the sentence imposed unless the trial 
court wholly departed from the 1989 Act, as amended in 2005.”  Id. at 706.  “So long as 
there  are  other  reasons  consistent  with  the  purposes  and  principles  of  sentencing,  as 
provided by statute, a sentence imposed . . . within the appropriate range” will be upheld 
on appeal.  Id.

The abuse of discretion with a presumption of reasonableness standard also applies 
to the imposition of consecutive sentences.  State v. Pollard, 432 S.W.3d 851, 859 (Tenn. 

-24-

2013).  A trial court has broad discretion in determining whether to impose consecutive 
service.  Id.  A trial court may impose consecutive sentencing if it finds by a preponderance 
of the evidence that one criterion is satisfied in Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-
115(b)(1)-(7)  (2019) (subsequently  amended).    In  determining  whether  to  impose 
consecutive sentences, though, a trial court must ensure the sentence is “no greater than 
that  deserved  for  the  offense  committed”  and  is  “the  least  severe  measure necessary  to 
achieve  the  purposes  for  which  the  sentence  is  imposed.”    T.C.A.  §  40-35-103(2),  (4) 
(2019); see State v. Desirey, 909 S.W.2d 20, 33 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995).

At  the  sentencing  hearing,  the  trial  court  received  the  presentence  report and 
certified copies of the Defendant’s prior convictions.  The court heard the arguments of the 
parties.  In an allocution, the Defendant acknowledged that he “gave these people a gun.”  
He apologized to the victims’ families.  The court found that the Defendant was a Range 
II  offender.    In  considering  the  statutory  enhancement  factors,  the  court  found  that  the 
Defendant had an extensive history of criminal convictions or behavior, that the Defendant 
was a leader in the commission of an offense involving two or more criminal actors, that 
the personal injuries or property damage inflicted upon a victim were particularly great as 
to the homicide offenses, that the Defendant possessed or employed a firearm during the 
commission of the homicide offenses, and that the Defendant had no hesitation to commit 
the offenses when the risk to human life was high.  See T.C.A. § 40-35-114(1), (2), (6), (9), 
(10).  The court declined to apply any mitigating factors.  See id. § 40-35-113 (2019).  With 
respect to consecutive sentencing, the court found that the Defendant’s history of criminal 
activity  was  extensive  and  that  his  behavior  showed  little  regard  for  human  life  and  no 
hesitation to commit an offense when the risk to human life was high.  See id. § 40-35-
115(b)(2),  (4).    The  court  found,  as  well,  that  the  circumstances  of  the  offenses  were 
aggravated and that an extended period of confinement was necessary to protect the public 
from the Defendant.  See State v. Wilkerson, 905 S.W.2d 933 (Tenn. 1995).  Based upon 
these findings, the court imposed an effective seventy-year sentence.

As we have stated, the Defendant’s sole argument on appeal is that the trial court 
erred in enhancing the length of his individual sentences based upon its application of the 
enhancement factor for his having been a leader in the commission of the offenses in which 
Mr.  Rivera,  Mr.  Morris,  and  Mr.  Albert  were  the  victims.    Accordingly,  we  limit  our 
consideration to the propriety of the court’s finding in this regard.  The record reflects that 
Mr. Cook and Mr. Nolbert arranged a transaction with the victims, whereby Mr. Cook and 
Mr.  Nolbert  were  going  to  “buy”  marijuana  with  counterfeit  $100  bills  from  the 
unsuspecting victims.  Before the planned meeting, Mr. Cook told the Defendant that he 
had a “lick,” and after they conversed privately, the Defendant provided Mr. Cook with a 
gun.  The Defendant watched from a nearby vantage point as Mr. Cook and Mr. Nolbert 
approached the victims, and Mr. Cook shot the victims and took the marijuana from Mr. 
Rivera.  The Defendant’s injection of the gun into the encounter escalated the situation and 
the ultimate danger to the victims.  After the shootings and the robbery, Mr. Cook gave the 

-25-

gun  and  the  marijuana  to  the  Defendant,  and  the  Defendant  hid  the  gun and  left  the 
marijuana in Ms. Walker’s apartment after threatening her with the gun when she told him 
to leave.  Thus, the Defendant concealed evidence of an instrumentality of the crimes.  The 
evidence  showed  that  Mr.  Cook  wanted  to  join  the  Defendant’s  street  gang  and  that  he 
committed the offenses in order to be inducted into the gang, which would enhance both 
his own and the Defendant’s stature.  The evidence does not preponderate against the trial 
court’s application of the “leader in the commission of the offense” enhancement factor.

Because  the  record  supports  the  trial  court’s  application  of  the  challenged 
enhancement factor, the Defendant has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion 
in sentencing him.  He is not entitled to relief on this basis.

In consideration of the foregoing and the record as a whole, the judgments of the 

trial court are affirmed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
