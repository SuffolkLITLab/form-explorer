      <pre>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT KNOXVILLE
January 19, 2023 Session

MICHAEL F. THOMAS v. KEN SMITH AUTO PARTS

Appeal from the Circuit Court for Hamilton County
No. 17C720      Ward Jeffrey Hollingsworth, Judge

No. E2022-00591-COA-R3-CV

This  appeal  concerns  breach  of  contract.    In  2012,  Michael  F.  Thomas  (“Thomas”), 
president  and  owner  of  CCW  Systems,  Inc.  (“CCW”),  completed  and  signed  an  open 
account application (“the Application”) with Ken Smith Auto Parts (“Ken Smith”).  The 
one page Application provided that Thomas would personally guarantee all invoices due 
to  Ken  Smith,  which sold  auto  parts  to  CCW.    Later  on,  CCW  became  delinquent  and 
dissolved.  In 2017, Ken Smith filed a civil warrant against Thomas in the General Sessions 
Court for Hamilton County.  This followed two unsuccessful attempts to serve Thomas on 
previous civil warrants.  The General Sessions Court ruled in favor of Ken Smith.  Thomas 
appealed to the Circuit Court for Hamilton County (“the Trial Court”).  The Trial Court 
granted  partial  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  Ken  Smith,  holding  that  Thomas  was 
personally liable for CCW’s debt.  After a bench trial, the Trial Court found, inter alia, that 
the four-year statute of limitations had not expired on Ken Smith’s breach of contract claim
because, in 2013, Thomas promised to pay the debt which served to renew the statute of 
limitations.  Thomas appeals to this Court.  We affirm.  

Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed;

03/21/2023OPINION

Background

In February 2012, Thomas, the president and owner of CCW, completed and signed 
the Application with Ken Smith.  Under the Application, which was one page in length, 
Thomas  personally  guaranteed all  invoices  due  to  Ken  Smith,  which  sold  auto  parts to 
CCW.  Later on, CCW became delinquent and dissolved.  The matter was then turned over 
to attorneys for collection.  In July 2013, Thomas told the firm handling the debt collection 
that he was closing a real estate deal and would “take care” of the debt.  However, the debt
went unpaid.  In December 2015, Ken Smith filed a civil warrant against Thomas in the 
General  Sessions  Court  for  Hamilton  County.    In  February  2016,  the  civil  warrant  and 
summons  were  returned  unserved.    That  same  month,  Ken  Smith  filed  its  second  civil 
warrant.    In  March  2016,  the  second  civil  warrant  and  alias  summons  were  returned 
unserved.  In February 2017, Ken Smith filed its third civil warrant.  On February 28, 2017, 
the third civil warrant and pluries summons were served on Thomas.  

In  June  2017, the  General  Sessions  Court  ruled  in  favor  of  Ken  Smith.    Thomas 
appealed  to the  Trial  Court,  where  a  dispute  arose  concerning  the  Trial  Court’s 
jurisdiction.1  This issue eventually went before the Tennessee Supreme Court on appeal.  
In Ken Smith Auto Parts v. Thomas, 599 S.W.3d 555 (Tenn. 2020), the Tennessee Supreme 
Court affirmed the Court of Appeals in holding that the Trial Court had jurisdiction in this 
case.  The case then returned to the Trial Court, where Thomas and Ken Smith had filed 
competing motions for summary judgment.  As part of his response to Ken Smith’s motion 
for summary judgment, Thomas filed a declaration, in which he asserted:

1. I am the defendant in this civil action.  I am over the age of eighteen, 

and I am otherwise competent to make this declaration.

2.  I  am  making  this  declaration  in  opposition  to  the  Motion  for 

Summary Judgment in this case filed by Ken Smith Auto Parts.

3.  On  or  about  February  7,  2012,  I  signed  an  Open  Account 
Application  for  Ken Smith  Auto  Parts  on  behalf  of  CCW  Systems,  Inc.    I 
signed  the  application  only  in  my  capacity  as President  of  CCW  Systems, 
Inc.,  and  I  indicated  this  by  writing  “Pres./Owner” on  the  line  next to  the 
heading “Title.”

4. I only signed the Open Account Application once — as President 
of CCW Systems, Inc.  I did not sign the Open Account Application in my
individual or personal capacity.

                                                  
1 The facts of this jurisdictional dispute are irrelevant to the appeal at bar.

-2-

5. Over the years, I have been involved in several businesses in the 
construction, automobile,  and  related  industries.  I  am  familiar  with  the 
process  of opening  accounts  with suppliers,  and  I  have  signed  many  open 
account and credit applications.  In my experience in connection with open 
account applications, a personal guarantee is ordinarily a separate document 
which  requires  a  separate  signature  from  the  guarantor  in  the  guarantor’s 
personal capacity.  At the very least, personal guarantee language is typically 
set  off  from  the  other language  in  the  application  and  highlighted  to  draw 
attention to the fact that the signatory is personally guaranteeing the entity’s 
debt.

6.  When  presented  with  Ken  Smith  Auto  Parts’ Open  Account 
Application, I glanced at the form quickly.  Because everything appeared to 
be in order, I simply signed the application in my representative capacity as 
president of CCW Systems, Inc. and returned the form to Ken Smith Auto 
Parts.    I  did  not  notice  the  single  sentence  at  the  bottom  of  the  form  that
contains personal guarantee language.  I was not aware, at the time I signed 
the application, that I was potentially personally guaranteeing obligations of 
CCW  Systems,  Inc,  owed  to  Ken  Smith Auto  Parts.    I  never,  at  any  time, 
intended to personally guarantee any obligations of CCW Systems, Inc.

It is Thomas’ position that the applicable four-year statute of limitations began to 
run  no  later  than October  15,  2012,  the date  by  which  Ken  Smith  demanded  payment.  
According  to  Thomas,  Ken  Smith’s  February  2017  civil  warrant—the  first  to  be 
successfully served upon him—was filed outside of the limitations period.

In September 2021, the Trial Court entered its memorandum order in which it ruled
on the parties’ competing motions for summary judgment.  In its memorandum order, the 
Trial Court stated, as relevant:

FACTS

Ken Smith opened an account for CCW.  Michael Thomas signed the 
Open Account Application for CCW on February 7, 2012.  A representative 
of Ken Smith signed on February 8, 2012.  This is the contract between the
parties.  

The paragraph above Michael Thomas’ signature states, among other 
things, “I personally guarantee all invoices due Ken Smith Auto Parts, Inc.”
Ken  Smith  provided  auto  parts  to  CCW.    CCW  did  not  pay.    Ken 
Smith’s suit against Thomas started in Sessions Court.  That judgment was 
appealed to this court.  After proceedings in this court, the Court of Appeals 
and the Tennessee Supreme Court, the case was remanded back to this court 

-3-

for  further  proceedings.    The  motions  for  summary  judgment  have  been
pending during all of the appellate proceedings.
Ken Smith’s motion

In its motion, Ken Smith argues that this court should find, as a matter 
of  law  that Michael  Thomas  is  personally  liable  for  any  debt  due  to  Ken 
Smith  under  the  contract.    For  the reasons  set  forth  below,  that  motion  is 
GRANTED.

The  language  in  the  contract  is  clear  and  unambiguous.  As  noted 
previously, the last sentence states “I personally guarantee all invoices due 
Ken Smith Auto Parts, Inc.”.  Under the reasoning of the Tennessee Supreme 
Court’s decision in M.L.G. Enterprises, LLC  v[.] Richard  L. Johnson (Tn. 
2016), the fact that Mr. Thomas signed the contract only once and identified
himself as president of CCW, does not invalidate the clear personal guarantee 
in the contract.  Therefore, Ken Smith’s motion is Granted and it is held that
Michael  Thomas  is  personally  liable to  Ken  Smith  for  all  sums  owed  by 
CCW under this contract.
Michael Thomas’ Motion

Mr.  Thomas  argues  in  his  motion  that  the  four  (4)  year  statute  of 
limitation  in  TCA 47-2-725  expired  before  Ken  Smith’s  law  suit  was 
properly commenced in the Sessions Court.  Ken Smith argues that the six 
(6) year statute of limitations applies, because Michael Thomas is being sued 
on a personal guarantee and not on the initial debt of CCW for payment for 
the auto parts.  The court agrees with Thomas that the four year statute of 
limitations applies.  However, because Ken Smith has produced proof that 
its  right  of  action  against  CCW  accrued  within  four (4)  years  of  the 
commencement of the Sessions Court action, Thomas’ motion is Denied.

The undisputed facts are as follows:

1) On February 7, 2012, CCW completed the Open Account Application with 
Ken Smith which serves as the contract in this case.  Michael Thomas signed 
the personal guarantee on the same date.
2) On October 3, 2012, CCW made its final payment to Ken Smith.  As of 
October 5, 2012, CCW owed Ken Smith $6,222.22.
3)  On  October  5,  2012,  Ken  Smith  made  a  demand  for  payment  of  the 
remaining balance by October 15, 2012.  CCW did not pay and on October 
17, 2012, Ken Smith turned the matter over to the lawyer for collection.

As  a  result  of  those  facts,  Ken  Smith’s  right  of  action  occurred  on 

October 5, 2012 or no later than October 15, 2012.

In  response  to  this  motion,  Ken  Smith  submitted  the  affidavit  of 
Patricia  Lester,  an employee  of  Mayfield  &  Lester,  Ken  Smith’s  lawyers.
Ms.  Lester  states  in  her  affidavit  that  on July  12,  2013,  Michael  Thomas 
stated in a phone call that he was closing a real estate deal and would pay the 

-4-

debt from the proceeds of that sale.  On July 31, 2013, Mr. Thomas stated in
another phone call, that the real estate deal had not closed but would close 
soon, indicating again he would pay the money owed to Ken Smith from that 
sale.

In Graves v[.] Sawyer, 588 SW2nd (Tn. 1979), the Court ruled that 
the acknowledgment of a debt and the indication of a willingness to pay tolls 
the running of a statute of limitations.  Therefore, there is an issue of fact as 
to  whether  the  statute  of  limitations  began  running  on October  5,  2012  or 
July 12 or July 31, 2013.  If the statute began to run in July, 2013, the facts
show that the Sessions Court proceeding was commenced on February 28, 
2017 at the latest, which is within four (4) years of July, 2013.

Therefore,  Michael  Thomas’ motion  for  summary  judgment  is 

DENIED.

Therefore, it is Ordered that the motion for summary judgment filed 
by Ken Smith Auto Parts, Inc., be Granted.  As a result, it is the ruling of this
court that Michael Thomas is personally liable for all sums due to Ken Smith 
Auto Parts, Inc. from CCW Systems, LLC.

It is further Ordered that the motion for summary judgment filed by 

Michael Thomas be DENIED.

A question thus remained for trial as to whether the alleged debt was barred by the 
applicable four-year statute of limitations found at Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-2-725.  Following 
a March 2022 bench trial, the Trial Court found that Ken Smith’s claim was not barred by 
the statute of limitations.  In its April 2022 final order, the Trial Court ruled in favor of Ken 
Smith, awarding it a judgment of $22,280.42.  This figure represented the initial balance 
owed by CCW of $6,222.22 plus interest at 1.5 percent per month as well as attorney’s fees 
calculated as one-third of the amount of the combined principal and interest.  In its final 
judgment, the Trial Court stated, as relevant:

The Court first heard testimony of a representative from Ken Smith 
Auto Parts.  The Court found that the testimony and documentary evidence 
put on at trial showed that Michael Thomas personally guaranteed the debt 
of CCW Systems, Inc[.] to Plaintiff.  The proof included invoices, ledgers, 
and a statement of account which identified $6,222.22 as owed at the time 
the debt  was  turned  for  collection.    Additionally,  the  “Open  Account 
Application” signed by Michael Thomas obligated him to pay attorney fees 
and bound him to the terms of the invoices which included a 1.5% per month 
late fee.  The amount owing through the date of trial is $16,710.32.  After 
adding a 1/3 attorney fee that the Court finds Plaintiff is entitled to pursuant 
to its contingency fee arrangement with its attorneys, the total due and owing 
is $22,280.42.

The Court next heard testimony from a representative of the collection 
law  firm, Mayfield  and  Lester.    The  testimony  and  documentary  evidence 
showed that Defendant Thomas had spoken with a representative of the law 
firm  on  July  12,  2013,  and  July  31,  2013,  and communicated  his 
acknowledgment of the debt as well as his promise to pay the debt from the
proceeds  of  an  upcoming  real  estate  closing  when  he  would  “take  care  of
[the]  bal[ance].”    The law  firm  representative  offered  testimony  as  to  the 
protocols at the law firm regarding contemporaneous file notations and how 
the  file  is  maintained  which  this  Court  found  credible.    Additionally,  the 
Court  heard  testimony  and  observed  phone  records  which  linked  the 
telephone communications with the file notes.

At  the  close  of  Plaintiff’s  proof,  Defendant  moved  that  the  case  be 
dismissed arguing that the four year statute of limitation had run.  The Court 
denied the motion based on the cases of Graves v. Sawyer, 588 S.W.2d 542 
(Tenn[.] 1979)  and  Ingram  v[.] Earthman,  993  S.W.2d  611  (Tenn[.] Ct[.]
App[.] 1998) and the communications between Thomas and the law firm.

Lastly, the Court heard testimony of Michael Thomas.  Mr. Thomas 
offered testimony that some of the parts had been repossessed by Ken Smith 
without credit being given.  The Court observed return slips identifying part 
numbers, but Mr. Thomas did not identify how much he was billed for these 
items or how much credit that he was allegedly due.  The testimony was also
contradicted  by  the  Ken  Smith  representative’s  earlier  trial  testimony  that 
consignment items are not billed until the items are sold.  Mr. Thomas further 
offered  testimony  that  he  did  not  own  any real  estate  at  the  time  of  the 
communications with Mayfield and Lester.  The Court, upon observing the 
witnesses and considering the documentary evidence presented at trial finds 
the Plaintiff[’s] proof to be the more credible.

Therefore, based on the above findings, it is

ORDERED that a judgment shall be and is hereby entered against Defendant 
Michael F. Thomas in the amount of $22,280.42 plus court costs which shall 
be taxed against Mr. Thomas, Defendant for which execution shall issue if 
necessary.

Thomas timely appealed to this Court.

Although not stated exactly as such, Thomas raises the following issues on appeal: 
1)  whether  the  Trial  Court  erred  in  granting  partial  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  Ken 
Smith on the issue of Thomas’ personal liability for amounts purportedly owed by CCW; 
2) whether  the  Trial  Court  erred  in  finding  that  the  four-year  statute  of  limitations 

Discussion

-6-

applicable to Ken Smith’s claims under Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-2-725 was tolled based on 
a  promise  to  pay  the  debt;  3)  whether  the  Trial  Court  erred  in  awarding  1.5 percent  per 
month in prejudgment interest on the amount purportedly owed by Thomas to Ken Smith 
where such interest was not authorized by the parties’ written agreement; and 4) whether 
the Trial Court erred in awarding attorney’s fees to Ken Smith equal to one-third of the
amount awarded without considering the factors set out in Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 1.5. 

With respect to that portion of the case decided after the bench trial, our review is 
de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of correctness of the findings of 
fact of the trial court, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.  Tenn. R. App. 
P. 13(d); Bogan v. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d 721, 727 (Tenn. 2001).  A trial court’s conclusions 
of law are subject to a de novo review with no presumption of correctness.  S. Constructors, 
Inc. v. Loudon Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 58 S.W.3d 706, 710 (Tenn. 2001).  This case was also 
decided in part by summary judgment.  Regarding the standard of review for cases decided
by summary judgment, the Tennessee Supreme Court has instructed:

Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, depositions, 
answers  to  interrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file,  together  with  the 
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Tenn. 
R. Civ. P. 56.04.  We review a trial court’s ruling on a motion for summary 
judgment de novo, without a presumption of correctness.  Bain v. Wells, 936 
S.W.2d 618, 622 (Tenn. 1997); see also Abshure v. Methodist Healthcare–
Memphis Hosp., 325 S.W.3d 98, 103 (Tenn. 2010).  In doing so, we make a 
fresh determination of whether the requirements of Rule 56 of the Tennessee 
Rules of Civil Procedure have been satisfied.  Estate of Brown, 402 S.W.3d 
193, 198 (Tenn. 2013) (citing Hughes v. New Life Dev. Corp., 387 S.W.3d 
453, 471 (Tenn. 2012)).

[I]n Tennessee, as in the federal system, when the moving party does not bear 
the  burden  of  proof  at  trial,  the  moving  party  may  satisfy  its  burden  of 
production  either  (1)  by  affirmatively  negating  an  essential  element  of  the 
nonmoving party’s claim or (2) by demonstrating that the nonmoving party’s 
evidence  at  the  summary  judgment  stage is  insufficient  to  establish  the 
nonmoving  party’s  claim  or  defense.    We  reiterate  that  a  moving  party 
seeking  summary  judgment  by  attacking  the  nonmoving  party’s  evidence
must do more than  make a conclusory assertion that summary judgment is 
appropriate on this basis.  Rather, Tennessee Rule 56.03 requires the moving 
party  to  support  its  motion  with  “a  separate  concise  statement  of  material 

***

-7-

facts  as  to  which  the  moving  party  contends  there  is  no  genuine  issue  for 
trial.”    Tenn.  R.  Civ.  P.  56.03.   “Each  fact  is to  be  set  forth  in  a  separate, 
numbered paragraph and supported by a specific citation to the record.”  Id.  
When such a motion is made, any party opposing summary judgment must 
file a response to each fact set forth by the movant in the manner provided in 
Tennessee Rule 56.03.  “[W]hen a  motion for summary judgment is  made 
[and] . . . supported as provided in [Tennessee Rule 56],” to survive summary 
judgment, the nonmoving party “may not rest upon the mere allegations or 
denials of [its] pleading,” but must respond, and by affidavits or one of the 
other means provided in Tennessee Rule 56, “set forth specific facts” at the 
summary  judgment  stage “showing  that  there  is  a  genuine  issue  for  trial.”  
Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.06.  The nonmoving party “must do more than simply 
show  that  there  is  some  metaphysical  doubt  as  to  the  material  facts.”  
Matsushita  Elec.  Indus.  Co. [v.  Zenith  Radio Corp.],  475  U.S.  [574,]  586, 
106  S.Ct.  1348[,  89 L.Ed.2d  538  (1986)].    The  nonmoving  party  must 
demonstrate the existence of specific facts in the record which could lead a 
rational trier of fact to find in favor of the nonmoving party.  If a summary 
judgment  motion  is  filed  before  adequate  time for  discovery  has  been 
provided,  the  nonmoving  party  may  seek  a  continuance  to  engage  in 
additional discovery as provided in Tennessee Rule 56.07.  However, after 
adequate time for discovery has been provided, summary judgment should 
be granted if the nonmoving party’s evidence at the summary judgment stage
is insufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact for 
trial.    Tenn.  R.  Civ.  P.  56.04,  56.06.    The  focus  is  on  the  evidence  the 
nonmoving party comes forward with at the summary judgment stage, not on 
hypothetical  evidence  that  theoretically  could  be  adduced,  despite  the 
passage of discovery deadlines, at a future trial.

Rye  v.  Women’s  Care  Ctr.  of  Memphis,  MPLLC, 477  S.W.3d  235,  250,  264-65  (Tenn. 
2015).  “Whether the nonmoving party is a plaintiff or a defendant—and whether or not 
the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof at trial on the challenged claim or defense—
at the summary judgment stage, ‘[t]he nonmoving party must demonstrate the existence of 
specific facts in the record which could lead a rational trier of fact to find in favor of the 
nonmoving  party.’”    TWB  Architects,  Inc.  v.  The  Braxton,  LLC,  578  S.W.3d  879,  889 
(Tenn. 2019) (quoting Rye, 477 S.W.3d at 265).

We first address whether the Trial Court erred in granting partial summary judgment 
in favor of Ken Smith on the issue of Thomas’ personal liability for amounts purportedly 
owed by CCW.  Thomas cites 84 Lumber Co. v. Smith, 356 S.W.3d 380, 382-83 (Tenn. 
2011)  for  the  proposition  that  while  a  signatory  to a  contract  who  signs  only  in  a 
representative  capacity  may  be  held  personally  liable  for  the  debt,  a  determination  of 

-8-

liability requires a finding that “the clear intent of the contract is to bind the representative.”  
(citations omitted).   Further, “[i]n most cases, a representative who signs a contract is not 
personally  bound  to  the  contract.”    Id.  at  382 (citations  omitted).    Thomas  also  cites
Creekside Partners v. Scott, No. M2012-00623-COA-R3-CV, 2013 WL 139573 (Tenn. Ct. 
App. Jan. 10, 2013), no appl. perm. appeal filed, in which this Court found that a signatory 
to a commercial lease who signed the lease only once and only in a representative capacity 
was  not  personally  liable  despite  unambiguous  personal  guaranty  language  in  the  lease.  
This Court stated, as pertinent:

Having closely examined the relevant language and the placement of 
that  language  in  the  credit  application  in  84  Lumber and  the  relevant 
language  and  the  placement  of  that  language  in  the  Lease  in  this  case,  we 
find significant differences.  In 84 Lumber, the guaranty provision is in all 
capital letters, set off from the rest of the text, and is immediately followed 
by Mr. Smith’s signature on the same page of the credit application.  Here, 
the guaranty provision is in the same size font as all the other provisions in 
the lease and is separated from Mr. Scott’s signature by two pages.

Furthermore,  where  Mr.  Smith’s  personal  obligation  is  exceedingly 
clear  in  the  guarantee  language  in  the  84  Lumber credit  application,  Mr. 
Scott’s  alleged personal  obligation  under  the  Lease  is  in  contradiction  to 
other provisions in the Lease.

Finally,  page  eleven  of  the  Lease  provides  that,  “[n]otices  to  any 
guarantor  shall  be  deemed  sent  when  sent  to  the  address  shown  on  the 
signatory page hereof,” yet no addresses for guarantors are listed.  Indeed, of 
the nineteen pages and 1,267 lines of text that comprise the Lease, only once 
does Mr. Scott’s name appear in relation to the words “guarantee” or “co-
tenant” and that is on line 826.

[W]e find the facts of this case distinguishable from 84 Lumber and conclude 
that the Lease does not show a clear intent that Mr. Scott was contracting as 
an  individual  guarantor  of  NTS’s  obligations.    Therefore,  we  affirm  the 
decision of the trial court.

Creekside Partners, 2013 WL 139573, at *5-6 (citations and footnote omitted).

According  to  Thomas,  the  personal  guarantee  language  in  the  Application  was 
“inconspicuous” and buried within the document.  He notes that it was non-bolded, and of 
the  same  font  and  style  of  a  paragraph  of  unrelated  provisions.    Thomas  asserts  that  he 
never intended to make himself personally liable.  Having reviewed the Application, we 
conclude  that  the  facts  of  this  case  are  distinct  from  those  of  Creekside Partners.    In 
Creekside Partners, the document at issue was nineteen pages long with 1,267 lines of text.  
Creekside Partners, 2013 WL 139573, at *5.  Here, the Application is only one page in 
length including  the  signature  lines,  and  the  contract  language  appears  in  a  single 
paragraph; it is a very brief document.  In his declaration filed below, Thomas asserted that 
he “glanced at the form quickly.”  Respectfully, if he had read the document, it would have 
been clear that he was agreeing to make himself personally liable to Ken Smith for unpaid 
invoices.  This is not a case where the personal guarantee language was buried within a 
lengthy or confusing document.  The provision was easy to spot in the one-page document.  
As Ken Smith points out, Thomas’ signature almost touches the word “personally” directly 
above the signature line.  We therefore affirm the Trial Court’s determination that Thomas 
agreed to make himself personally liable to Ken Smith for unpaid invoices.

We next address whether the Trial Court erred in finding that the four-year statute 
of limitations applicable to Ken Smith’s claims under Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-2-725 was 
tolled based on a promise to pay the debt.  The parties agree on appeal that the applicable 
statute of limitations is four years.  Ken Smith demanded payment by October 15, 2012.  
Four years from that date was October 15, 2016.  To recap, Ken Smith filed its first and 
second civil warrants in December 2015 and February 2016 respectively.  Summonses for 
both  were  returned  unserved.    It  was  only  in February  of  2017  that  Thomas was served 
with summons in connection with the third civil warrant.  Thomas contends that Ken Smith 
could not rely on its previous attempts to serve him for statute of limitations purposes.  He 
cites Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-15-710, which provides:

The suing out of a warrant is the commencement of a civil action within the 
meaning of this title, whether it is served or not; but if the process is returned 
unserved, plaintiff, if plaintiff wishes to rely on the original commencement 
as a bar to the running of a statute of limitations, must either prosecute and 
continue the action by applying for and obtaining new process from time to 
time,  each  new  process  to  be  obtained  within  nine  (9)  months  from  return 
unserved  of  the  previous  process,  or  plaintiff must  recommence  the  action 
within one (1) year after the return of the initial process not served.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-15-710.

Thomas notes that some eleven months passed between the return without service 
of Ken Smith’s alias warrant in March 2016 and issuance of the pluries warrant in February

-10-

2017.    Therefore,  per  Thomas’  argument,  Ken  Smith’s  claim  was  time-barred.  
Nevertheless, the Trial Court found that Ken Smith’s claim was timely filed because of a 
statement Thomas made over the telephone on July 12, 2013 to an individual at Mayfield 
& Lester, Ken Smith’s law firm, in which he advised that he was closing on a real estate 
deal soon and he would take care of the balance.  The individual Thomas spoke to did not 
testify.  Instead, Patricia Lester, a representative of Mayfield & Lester, relied on account 
notes in testifying to the conversation.

Thomas contends that the Trial Court erred on this issue concerning the statute of 
limitations  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  to  wit:  that  the  alleged  statements  by  Thomas  were 
inadmissible hearsay; that the individual who  spoke to Thomas did not testify; that Ken 
Smith’s sole reliance on notes indicates a lack of trustworthiness of the evidence; that the 
statement by Thomas, if made, did not amount to a distinct and unconditional promise to 
pay; that the statute of limitations could not be tolled because any promise allegedly made 
by Thomas to pay the debt was made in his individual capacity and not as a representative 
of CCW; and that, even if tolling were justified, the tolling period would have lasted only 
until August 21, 2013 at most when account notes reflect that Thomas told the firm that he 
had no money to pay the debt.  For its part, Ken Smith states that Thomas’ August 2013 
statement that he had no money was not a renunciation of his earlier promise to pay, and 
that it was only on July 24, 2014 when a file note reflects that Thomas said  he was not 
going to pay.

Concerning  evidentiary  issues,  “[t]he  appellate  court affords  the  trial  court  wide 
discretion  regarding  the  admissibility  of  evidence  and  will  not  overturn  the  trial  court’s 
determination absent an abuse  of that discretion.”  Goodale v. Langenberg, 243 S.W.3d 
575,  587  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2007) (citation  omitted).    Regarding  the  abuse  of  discretion 
standard of review, “[a] court abuses its discretion when it causes an injustice to the party 
challenging  the  decision  by  (1)  applying  an  incorrect  legal  standard,  (2)  reaching  an 
illogical  or  unreasonable  decision,  or  (3)  basing  its  decision  on  a  clearly  erroneous 
assessment  of  the  evidence.”    Fisher  v.  Hargett,  604  S.W.3d  381,  395  (Tenn.  2020) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Harmon v. Hickman Cmty. Healthcare Servs., 
Inc., 594 S.W.3d 297, 305-06 (Tenn. 2020) (citations omitted)).  Thomas objected below 
to the admission of the account notes.  The Trial Court overruled the objection, finding that 
the business records exception applied to allow the evidence.  We agree.  The Trial Court 
later found that “[t]he law firm representative offered testimony as to the protocols at the 
law firm regarding contemporaneous file notations and how the file is maintained which 
this  Court  found  credible.   Additionally,  the Court  heard  testimony  and  observed  phone 
records which linked the telephone communications with the file notes.”  The Trial Court 
further  found  that  “[t]he  Court,  upon  observing  the  witnesses  and  considering  the 
documentary  evidence  presented  at  trial  finds  the  Plaintiff[’s] proof  to  be  the  more 
credible.”  We discern no hint of untrustworthiness or unreliability in the account notes.  

-11-

Thomas’ statements to the firm were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.  That 
is, Thomas’ statements were not offered to prove that he really was going to pay the debt.  
Rather, the statements were offered to show that Thomas made the promise to pay the debt.  
We also note that the statements by Thomas fit squarely under Tennessee Rule of Evidence 
803(1.2) as admission by party-opponent.  As to the account notes, which are hearsay, we 
find no error in the Trial Court’s finding that the business records exception applies.  See
Tenn. R. Evid. 803(6).  We find no reversible error in the Trial Court’s decision to admit 
the account notes.

With respect to whether Thomas’ statement constituted a distinct and unconditional 
promise to pay the debt, Thomas cites, among other cases, Alexander v. Muse, 112 Tenn. 
233, 79 S.W. 117 (Tenn. 1904) for the proposition that a “weak” and “indefinite” promise 
to pay sometime in the future is insufficient to remove the bar of the statute of limitations.  
However, Thomas’ statement that he would “take care” of the balance was not conditioned 
on anything.  He did not say, for example, that there was a chance that the real estate deal 
would not go through.  In other words, it was a matter of when and not if he would pay the 
debt.  He did not link his taking care of the balance to any other condition.  While perhaps 
stated informally, Thomas’ statement that he would take care of the balance constituted a 
distinct and unconditional promise to pay the debt for which he was liable.  

Regarding the effect of Thomas’ promise on the statute of limitations, both parties 
discuss the case of Graves v. Sawyer, 588 S.W.2d 542 (Tenn. 1979), which also was cited 
by  the  Trial  Court  in  its  order.    In  Graves,  the Tennessee Supreme  Court  considered 
whether  a  voluntary,  unconditional  payment  of  interest  on  a  promissory  note  tolled  the 
statute of limitations to the date of the payment.  Id.  In 1969, the respondents executed a 
promissory note of $2,500, due 180 days after execution.  Id.  No payments were made on 
the principal, but the respondents made three  interest payments on the note after its due 
date, with the final coming in 1972.  Id. at 543.  In 1976, the petitioner filed suit to collect 
the note.  Id.  The respondents relied on the six-year statute of limitations.  Id.  The trial 
court ruled for the petitioner.  Id.  On appeal, the Tennessee Court of Appeals reversed the 
trial court.  Id.  Our Supreme Court in turn reversed the Court of Appeals, stating in part:

[W]e  think  the  affirmative  act  of  a  debtor  in  making  a  voluntary, 
unconditional payment on a debt, or interest due on a debt, is such an act that 
implies “a willingness to pay.”  What act, short of an unconditional, express 
promise to pay, could more strongly indicate  a willingness to pay than the 
payment itself?

***

-12-

Ultimately,  the  effect  of  part  payment  of  a  debt  or  a  payment  of 
interest on a debt depends, of course, upon the circumstances in which the 
payment is made.  But in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we hold 
that such a payment is an acknowledgment of the debt and implies a promise 
of  payment  which  operates  to  keep  the  debt  alive  for  the  statutory  period 
from that time.

Graves, 588 S.W.2d at 544.

In  Ingram  v.  Earthman,  993  S.W.2d  611 (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1998),  this  Court 

elaborated on the doctrines of estoppel and revival, stating in part:

Estoppel  and  revival  are  complementary  responses  to  a  statute  of 
limitations  defense.  A  defendant  will  be  estopped  to  assert  a  statute  of 
limitations  defense  when  it  induces  a  plaintiff  to  refrain  from  filing  suit 
during the applicable limitations period.  Statements or conduct that support 
an estoppel claim include representations, made prior to the expiration of the 
limitations  period,  that  the  defendant  either  would  not  assert  a  statute  of 
limitations defense or that the dispute would be amicably resolved without 
filing  suit.    Persons  who  successfully  establish  the  estoppel  exception  to  a 
statute  of  limitations  defense  must  file  suit  within  a  reasonable  time  after 
becoming aware that the debtor will not pay the debt.

Similarly, a defendant may revive a plaintiff’s remedy that had been 
barred by the running of a statute of limitations either by expressly promising 
to pay the debt or by acknowledging the debt and expressing a willingness to 
pay it.  The defendant must make the promise or give the acknowledgment 
directly to the plaintiff or someone standing in such a close relationship with 
the plaintiff that it is reasonable to infer that the defendant’s statements will 
reach the plaintiff.  

The expression of willingness to pay the debt that must accompany 
the acknowledgment of the debt may be implied from the defendant’s words 
or acts but, in whatever form, the words or acts must amount to a recognition 
of the continuing obligation.  Persons who successfully establish the revival 
exception to a statute of limitations defense must file suit with the applicable 
limitations period measured from when the conduct constituting the revival 
occurred.

Ingram, 993 S.W.2d at 633-34 (footnote and citations omitted).2

Our  Supreme  Court  has  further  discussed  the  effect  of  a  defendant  misleading  a 

plaintiff, and the time in which a plaintiff has to file suit after being misled, as follows:

Having  held  that  the  discovery  rule  and  equitable  estoppel  are 
different, we must now decide how long the statute of limitations is tolled 
when  a  plaintiff  successfully  invokes  the  latter.    The  answer  is  clear:  the 
tolling period equals the amount of time the defendant misled the plaintiff.  
See Lusk [v. Consol. Aluminum Corp.], 655 S.W.2d [917,] 920-921 [(Tenn. 
1983)].  Equitable estoppel is premised on the defendant’s wrongdoing, and, 
consequently, the plaintiff must be given the time during which the defendant 
misled  the  plaintiff  so  that  plaintiff’s  entitlement  to  the  full  statutory  time 
period is preserved.  This is similar to the result in discovery rule cases, where 
the  defendant’s  fraudulent  concealment  prevents 
the  plaintiff  from 
discovering his cause of action.  See Vance [v. Schulder], 547 S.W.2d [927,]
930  [(Tenn.  1977)]  (“[The  statute]  begins  to  run  as  of  the  time  of  the 
discovery of the fraud by the plaintiff.”).  Any other result would reward the 
defendant  for  his  deception.    As  discussed  above,  Fahrner  claims  that  he 
missed the time deadline because SW Manufacturing misled him until May 
1998.  If true—as will be determined on remand—Fahrner would be entitled 
to  a  full  year  from  that  time,  assuming  he  is  entitled  to  equitable  estoppel 
relief.    Since  Fahrner  filed  suit  in  December  1998,  he  will  have  met  the 
deadline.

Fahrner v. SW Mfg., Inc., 48 S.W.3d 141, 146 (Tenn. 2001).

In his reply brief, Thomas discusses Graves and Ingram, stating that “the distinction 
drawn in Ingram between the estoppel-based tolling that occurs when a promise to pay is 
made before the statute of limitations runs out and the revival of the limitations period that 

                                                  
2 In Redwing v. Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 363 S.W.3d 436, 461 n.25 (Tenn. 2012), our 
Supreme Court stated as follows regarding Ingram v. Earthman:

On this point, Fahrner v. SW Mfg., Inc. [48 S.W.3d 141 (Tenn. 2001)] appears to reverse 
Ingram v. Earthman, 993 S.W.2d at 633 and Fairway Vill. Condo. Ass’n v. Connecticut 
Mut.  Life  Ins.  Co.,  934  S.W.2d  342,  346  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1996)  in  which  the  Court  of 
Appeals adopted the majority rule that if the basis for estoppel ends before the statute of 
limitations  has  run,  the  plaintiff  must  file  suit  within  the  original  limitations  period  if 
reasonable time remains within which to file suit.  Likewise, if the basis for estoppel ends 
after the statute of limitations has run, the plaintiff must file suit within a reasonable time.  
Because the parties in this case have not joined issue on this point, we need not reconsider 
it in the present case.

occurs upon a promise to pay made after the statute of limitations expires contradicts [Ken 
Smith’s] argument.”  (Emphasis in original).  We note first that Graves is an opinion by 
the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court,  whereas  Ingram is  by  the  Tennessee  Court  of  Appeals.  
Graves has never  been  overturned.    We  must adhere  to  our  Supreme  Court’s  binding 
precedent.  In Graves, our Supreme Court stated that “in the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, we hold that such a payment [on a debt] is an acknowledgment of the debt and 
implies  a  promise  of  payment  which  operates  to  keep  the  debt  alive for  the  statutory 
period  from  that  time.”    Graves,  588  S.W.2d at  544 (emphasis  added).    The  Supreme 
Court also asked rhetorically,  “[w]hat act, short of an unconditional, express promise to 
pay, could more strongly indicate a willingness to pay than the payment itself?”  Id.  In the 
appeal  at  bar,  Thomas  made  an  unconditional,  express promise  in  July  2013  to  pay  the 
balance  for  which  he  was  liable.    Notwithstanding  the  discussion  on  the  differences 
between estoppel and revival contained in Ingram, we hold that Graves is more directly on 
point and controls.  Thomas’ July 2013 promise to pay the balance served to “keep the debt 
alive  for  the  statutory  period  from  that  time.”    Graves,  588  S.W.2d at  544.    Thus,  the 
applicable four-year statute of limitations began to run from July 2013.

In addition, Thomas’ argument that he could not toll the statute of limitations in his 
individual  capacity  is  unpersuasive,  as  well.    Thomas  cites  to  C.A.  Hobbs,  Jr.,  Inc.  v. 
Brainard, 919 S.W.2d 337, 339 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995) for the proposition that statements 
made  by  someone  other  than  the  original  obligor  are  insufficient  to  toll  the  statute  of 
limitations.  (“Only a maker of a note can remove an already existing note from the statute 
of limitations by expressing a willingness to pay without the execution of a new note.”).  
Thomas  states  that,  since payment  of  the  debt  was  sought  from  him  in  his  individual 
capacity, any alleged conversation he had with Mayfield & Lester could only have occurred 
in  his individual  capacity  and not  in  his  capacity as  a  representative  of  CCW,  thus  his 
statements could not serve to toll the statute of limitations.  However, Thomas signed the 
Application on CCW’s behalf.  CCW acted through Thomas.  Thomas also agreed to be 
personally  liable  to  Ken  Smith  for  unpaid  invoices  through  his  signature  on  the 
Application.    Under  these  circumstances,  Thomas’  attempt  to  compartmentalize  his 
capacities is without merit.

In sum, the Trial Court did not err in admitting the account notes; Thomas’ 2013 
statement that he would take care of the debt constituted an unconditional promise to pay 
the debt; and the effect of Thomas’ unconditional promise was to keep the debt alive for 
the statutory period from that time, in accordance with Graves.  Ken Smith’s action against 
Thomas for breach of contract was timely filed.  We affirm the Trial Court as to this issue.

We next address whether the Trial Court erred in awarding 1.5 percent per month 
in prejudgment interest on the amount purportedly owed by Thomas to Ken Smith where 
such interest was not authorized by the parties’ written agreement.  Thomas notes that the 

-15-

Application itself does not allow Ken Smith to recover any interest or late fees.  Instead, it 
is only on the back of invoices sent by Ken Smith to CCW where it is stated that interest 
will accrue on unpaid balances at 1.5 percent per month.  While the Application states that 
“I  also  agree  to  be  bound  by  any  terms  listed  on  an  invoice  in  addition  to  those  on  this 
application,” Thomas says that this represents a mere “agreement to agree” and is therefore 
unenforceable under Tennessee law.  He also says that it is an unenforceable consent to 
allow unilateral modification of a contract.  In Abbott v. Abbott, No. E2015-01233-COA-
R3-CV, 2016 WL 3976760, at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 20, 2016), no appl. perm. appeal 
filed,  this  Court  stated:  “Because  of  the  uncertainty  implicit  in  these  agreements, 
agreements to agree are simply not enforceable in Tennessee courts.  Similarly, because 
the provision omits a sales price or a method to determine a sales price, the trial court erred 
in finding that the provision was enforceable.”  

Thomas  is  correct  regarding  the  unenforceability  of  agreements  to  agree  in 
Tennessee.  This, however, neither was an agreement to agree later on an amount of interest 
or  late  fees nor  an  unenforceable  consent  to  allow  unilateral  modification  of  a  contract.  
Rather, Thomas agreed to be bound by whatever terms as to interest or late fees would be 
listed  on  an  invoice.    Here, there  were  a  series  of  invoices.    This  shows that  Thomas 
repeatedly made purchases notwithstanding the language in the invoices about interest.  If 
Thomas was dissatisfied with the 1.5 percent interest provision on the invoices, he simply 
could have stopped making purchases.  As it happened, he did not.  In short, there was no 
contractual term left open for future bargaining, and the interest provision in the invoices 
was not an unenforceable agreement to agree.  We affirm the Trial Court’s award of interest 
to Ken Smith.

The final issue we address is whether the Trial Court erred in awarding attorney’s
fees  to  Ken  Smith  equal  to  one-third  of  the  amount  owed,  plus  prejudgment  interest, 
without  considering  the  factors  set  out  in  Tenn.  Sup.  Ct.  R.  8,  RPC  1.5.    Both  the 
Application and invoices contained attorney’s fee provisions.  Thomas argues that the Trial 
Court’s  award  to  Ken  Smith  of  attorney’s  fees  must be  vacated for  failure  to  apply  the 
relevant factors.3  “[A] determination of attorney’s fees is within the discretion of the trial 
                                                  
3 As pertinent, Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 1.5 provides:

(a) A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an 
unreasonable  amount  for  expenses.    The  factors  to  be  considered  in  determining  the 
reasonableness of a fee include the following:
(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and 
the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;
(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment 
will preclude other employment by the lawyer;
(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;
(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;

court and will be upheld unless the trial court abuses its discretion.”  Wright ex rel. Wright 
v. Wright, 337 S.W.3d 166, 176 (Tenn. 2011) (citations omitted).  The Wright court stated 
that, in awarding attorney’s fees, trial courts should develop an evidentiary record, make 
findings concerning each factor, and determine a reasonable fee based on the circumstances 
of the case.  Id. at 185-86 (citation omitted).  

The Trial Court did not apply the factors set out in Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 1.5.  
Thomas is correct in that vacating and remanding for the Trial Court to apply the Tenn. 
Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 1.5 factors is an option.  However, the Trial Court awarded Ken Smith 
approximately  $5,570 in  attorney’s  fees,  a  figure  representing one-third  of  the  principal 
amount owed plus prejudgment interest totaling $16,710.32.  To put the $5,570 figure in 
context, this case has lasted for over five years.  It has been litigated at the general sessions 
court level, the circuit court level, twice in this Court, and in the Tennessee Supreme Court.  
If  we  were  to  vacate  and  remand  for  a  new  determination  of  reasonable  attorney’s  fees 
applying the Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 1.5 factors, the amount awarded to Ken Smith would 
almost certainly be larger than the $5,570 awarded.  Thus, while this was error by the Trial 
Court, it was harmless as to Thomas.  Therefore, in the interest of judicial economy, we 
decline to vacate the Trial Court’s award of attorney’s fees despite its failure to consider 
the Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 1.5 factors.  We affirm the judgment of the Trial Court in all 
respects.

Conclusion

The judgment of the Trial Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the Trial 
Court  for  collection  of  the  costs  below.    The  costs  on  appeal  are  assessed  against  the 
Appellant, Michael F. Thomas, and his surety, if any.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
