      <pre>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT NASHVILLE
Assigned on Briefs January 3, 2023

IN RE KHLOE B.1

Appeal from the Chancery Court for Warren County
No. 781-A Larry B. Stanley, Chancellor
___________________________________

No. M2022-01013-COA-R3-PT
___________________________________

This  is  the  second  appeal  involving  the  termination  of  a  mother’s  parental  rights  to  this
child.  Following a bench trial, the court found that clear and convincing evidence existed 
to support termination but failed to identify any specific statutory section in support of its 
decision.  We vacated the trial court’s decision and remanded for sufficient findings of fact 
and conclusions of law.  Upon remand, the court offered additional findings of fact and 
conclusions of law before ultimately holding that the evidence presented established the 
following statutory grounds of termination: (1) abandonment and (2) failure to manifest an 
ability and willingness to care for the child.  The court also found that termination of the 
mother’s rights was in the best interest of the child.  We now affirm the court’s ultimate 
termination decision.

Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Chancery Court
Affirmed in Part, Reversed in Part; Case Remanded

JOHN W. MCCLARTY, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which W. NEAL MCBRAYER
and KENNY W. ARMSTRONG, JJ., joined.  

Sheila F. Younglove, Dunlap, Tennessee, for the appellant, Summer K.  

Robert W. Newman, McMinnville, Tennessee, for the appellees, Heather and Michael B.

Christine S. Stanford, McMinnville, Tennessee, guardian ad litem for the minor child.

                                           

1 This court has a policy of protecting the identity of children in parental rights termination cases 
by initializing the last name of the parties.  The record reflects that the child’s last name was changed to 
that of her adoptive parents during the pendency of the second appeal of this termination proceeding.  

03/14/2023OPINION

I.

BACKGROUND

Khloe B.  (“the  Child”)  was  born  to  Summer  K. (“Mother”)  and  Christopher O.2
(“Father”)  in  November 2016.    In  June  2018,  the  Tennessee  Department  of  Children’s 
Services (“DCS”) received a referral alleging environmental neglect, drug exposure, and 
lack  of  supervision.    At  that  time,  the  Child  was  living  with  her  maternal  grandparents, 
whose  home  was  described as  “deplorable”  and  unsafe.    The  Child  was  malnourished, 
underweight,  jaundiced,  and  had  not  regularly  attended  her  recommended  pediatrician 
appointments.  She also could not walk and had been diagnosed with an epilepsy disorder 
and delays in speech and learning.  

The  Child  was  placed  with  the  maternal  great  aunt  and  uncle (collectively 
“Petitioners”)  upon  removal.    She  was  later  adjudicated  as  dependent  and  neglected.  
Mother was granted supervised visitation.  DCS requested closure of the case in July 2019, 
citing Mother’s failure to address the issues that led to removal.  The court closed the case, 
allowing the Child to remain with Petitioners as her guardians, effective August 2019.  

Petitioners  moved to  terminate  Mother’s  parental  rights  on  September  17,  2020, 
alleging abandonment for failure to visit and to remit child support.  Mother responded by 
stating  that  Petitioners  had  thwarted  her  efforts  to  visit  and  that  she  was  attempting  to 
secure  employment  to  assist  in  her  payment  of  child  support.  The  case  proceeded  to  a 
hearing on July 12, 2021.3  

The record reflects that, in the four months prior to the termination petition, Mother 
paid  $20  in  child  support.    However,  her  $1,200  stimulus  check  was  also automatically 
applied to her child support arrearage.  Mother attended two visits with the Child during 
the pertinent time period, each lasting approximately two hours.  Petitioners alleged that 
Mother was distracted by two cellphones during these visits and that she spent more time 
on her phones than with the Child.  Petitioners expressed a desire to adopt the Child, with 
whom they alleged to have established a loving relationship as mother and father. 

Mother testified that Petitioners often cancelled her visits at the last minute or failed 
to respond to her efforts to schedule a visit.  She confirmed that she secured employment 
on a number of occasions but that she was unable to maintain a position for longer than a 
few days.  She stated that she lives with her parents and that her current residence did not 
have running water.  

                                           

2 Father voluntarily surrendered his parental rights and is not a party to this appeal. 

3 A statement of proceedings was provided in lieu of a transcript.

Following  the  hearing,  the  court  entered  an  order  listing  its  findings  of  fact.  
Thereafter, the court entered its final order, granting the termination petition and adopting 
its  previously  entered  findings  of  fact.    The  court  also  stated  that  it  found  by  clear  and 
convincing evidence that Mother failed to manifest an ability and willingness to parent the 
Child, a ground not alleged in the termination petition.  The final order did not include any 
citation to any particular statutory ground of termination.  Mother appealed. 

A  panel  of  this  court  vacated  the  decision  and  remanded  for  the  preparation  of 
findings of fact and conclusions of law.  In re Khloe O., No. M2021-01125-COA-R3-PT, 
2022  WL  2164288,  at  *5-6  (Tenn.  Ct. App.  June  16,  2022).    Upon  remand,  the  parties
entered  an  agreed  order  to  conform  the  pleadings  to  the  evidence,  adding  the  statutory 
ground of failure to manifest an ability and willingness to assume custody of the Child to 
the termination petition.  The court then issued a new final order in which it found that the 
evidence presented established the statutory grounds of (1) abandonment and (2) failure to 
manifest  an  ability  and  willingness  to  care  for  the  Child.  The  court  also  found  that 
termination of Mother’s rights was in the best interest of the Child.  This appeal followed.  

II.

ISSUES

We consolidate and restate the issues pertinent to this appeal as follows: 

A. Whether  clear  and  convincing  evidence  supports  the  trial  court’s 
finding of statutory grounds for termination. 

B. Whether  clear  and  convincing  evidence  supports  the  trial  court’s 
finding that termination of was in the best interest of the Child. 

III.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

Parents have a fundamental right to the care, custody, and control of their children.  
Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972); In re Drinnon, 776 S.W.2d 96, 97 (Tenn. Ct. 
App. 1988).  This right “is among the oldest of the judicially recognized liberty interests 
protected by the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.”  In re M.J.B., 
140 S.W.3d 643, 652-53 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004).  “Termination of a person’s rights as a 
parent is a grave and final decision, irrevocably altering the lives of the parent and child 
involved and ‘severing forever all legal rights and obligations’ of the parent.”  Means v. 
Ashby,  130  S.W.3d  48,  54  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2003)  (quoting Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-
113(I)(1)).  “‘[F]ew consequences of judicial action are so grave as the severance of natural 
family ties.’”  M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 119 (1996) (quoting Santosky v. Kramer, 455 
U.S. 745, 787 (1982)).

- 3 -

Although  parental  rights  are  superior  to  the  claims  of  other  persons  and  the 
government,  they  are  not  absolute  and  may  be  terminated  upon  appropriate  statutory 
grounds.  See In Re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d 240, 250 (Tenn. 2010); Blair v. Badenhope, 77 
S.W.3d 137, 141 (Tenn. 2002).  Due process requires clear and convincing evidence of the 
existence of the grounds for termination.  In re Drinnon, 776 S.W.2d at 97.  A parent’s 
rights may be terminated only upon

(1) [a] finding by the court by clear and convincing evidence that the grounds 
for termination of parental or guardianship rights have been established; and
(2)  [t]hat  termination  of  the  parent’s  or  guardian’s  rights  is  in  the  best 
interest[ ] of the child.

Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-113(c).  “[A]  court  must  determine  that  clear  and  convincing 
evidence  proves  not  only  that  statutory  grounds  exist  [for  the  termination]  but  also  that 
termination  is  in  the  child’s  best  interest.”    In  re Valentine,  79  S.W.3d  539,  546  (Tenn. 
2002).  The existence of at least one statutory basis for termination of parental rights will 
support the trial court’s decision to terminate those rights.  In re C.W.W., 37 S.W.3d 467, 
473 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000), abrogated on other grounds by In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 
838 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).

The heightened burden of proof in parental termination cases minimizes the risk of 
erroneous decisions.  In re C.W.W., 37 S.W.3d at 474; In re M.W.A., Jr., 980 S.W.2d 620, 
622 (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1998).
“Evidence  satisfying  the  clear  and  convincing  evidence 
standard establishes that the truth of the facts asserted is highly probable and eliminates 
any serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of the conclusions drawn from the 
evidence.”  In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 861 (citations omitted).  It produces in a fact-
finder’s  mind  a  firm  belief  or  conviction  regarding  the  truth  of  the  facts  sought  to  be 
established.    In  re  A.D.A.,  84  S.W.3d  592,  596  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2002); Ray  v.  Ray,  83 
S.W.3d 726, 733 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001); In re C.W.W., 37 S.W.3d at 474.

In 2016, the Tennessee Supreme Court provided guidance to this court in reviewing 

cases involving the termination of parental rights:

An  appellate  court  reviews  a  trial  court’s  findings  of  fact  in  termination 
proceedings using the standard of review in Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d).  Under 
Rule  13(d),  appellate  courts  review  factual  findings  de  novo  on  the  record 
and accord these findings a presumption of correctness unless the evidence 
In  light  of  the  heightened  burden  of  proof  in 
preponderates  otherwise. 
termination  proceedings,  however,  the  reviewing  court  must  make  its  own 
determination as to whether the facts, either as found by the trial court or as 
supported  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  amount  to  clear  and 
convincing evidence of the elements necessary to terminate parental rights. 
The trial court’s ruling that the evidence sufficiently supports termination of
- 4 -

parental rights is a conclusion of law, which appellate courts review de novo 
with no presumption of correctness.  Additionally, all other questions of law 
in  parental  termination  appeals,  as  in  other  appeals,  are  reviewed  de  novo 
with no presumption of correctness.

In re Carrington H., 483 S.W.3d 507, 523-24 (Tenn. 2016) (citations omitted); see also In 
re Gabriella D., 531 S.W.3d 662, 680 (Tenn. 2017).

Lastly,  in  the  event  that  the  “resolution  of  an  issue  in  a  case  depends  upon  the 
truthfulness  of  witnesses,  the  trial  judge,  who  has  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  the 
witnesses and their manner and demeanor while testifying, is in a far better position than 
this Court to decide those issues.”  In re Navada N., 498 S.W.3d 579, 591 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
2016) (citing McCaleb v. Saturn Corp., 910 S.W.2d 412, 415 (Tenn. 1995); Whitaker v. 
Whitaker,  957  S.W.2d  834,  837  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1997)).  “Thus,  this  court  gives  great 
weight  to  the  credibility  accorded  to  a  particular  witness  by  the  trial  court.”    In  re 
Christopher J., No. W2016-02149-COA-R3-PT, 2017 WL 5992359 at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
Dec. 4, 2017) (citing Whitaker, 957 S.W.2d at 837).

As  indicated  above,  the  court  granted  the  termination  petition  based  upon  the 
following  statutory  grounds:  (1)  abandonment  and  (2)  failure  to  manifest  an  ability  and 
willingness  to  care  for  the  Child.    Mother  does  not  offer  any  argument  disputing  the 
statutory grounds of termination.  Nevertheless, we will consider each ground as required 
by  our  Supreme  Court.    In  re  Carrington  H.,  483  S.W.3d  at  525-26  (“[T]he  Court  of
Appeals must review the trial court’s findings as to each ground for termination and as to 
whether  termination  is  in  the  child’s  best  interests,  regardless  of  whether  the  parent 
challenges these findings on appeal.”).  

IV. DISCUSSION

A.

1.

Abandonment

Failure to Visit

Parental  rights  may  be  terminated  for abandonment  when  a  parent  fails  to  visit  a 
child for a period of four consecutive months immediately before the filing of a petition to 
terminate parental rights.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(A)(i).  A failure to visit “means 
the  failure,  for  a  period  of  four  (4)  consecutive  months,  to  visit  or  engage  in  more  than 
token  visitation.”    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-102(1)(E).  The  statute  requires  that  parents 
offer  their  children  more  than  “token  visitation,”  defined  as  visitation  that  “under  the 
circumstances of the individual case, constitutes nothing more than perfunctory visitation 
- 5 -

or visitation of such an infrequent nature or of such short duration as to merely establish 
minimal or insubstantial contact with the child.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(C).

A parent may assert as an affirmative defense pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil 
Procedure 8.03 that his or her failure to visit was not “willful.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-
102(1)(I).  The  burden  is  on  the  parent  asserting  the  affirmative  defense  to  prove  by  a 
preponderance of the evidence that his or her failure to visit the child was not willful.  Id.;
In re Kolton C., No. E2019-00736-COA-R3-PT, 2019 WL 6341042 at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
Nov. 26, 2019).

Here, Petitioners filed their petition on September 17, 2020, so the relevant four-
month period is May 17, 2020, to September 16, 2020.  See In re Jacob C.H., No. E2013-
00587-COA-R3-PT, 2014 WL 689085 at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 20, 2014) (statutory four-
month period covers four months preceding the day the termination petition was filed and 
does  not  include  the  day  petition  was  filed).  Mother  raised  a  lack  of  willfulness  as  an 
affirmative  defense  in  her  answer to  the  petition.    Mother  claimed  at  the  hearing  that 
Petitioners thwarted her efforts at visitation.  The trial court found that her testimony on 
this issue was not credible and that Mother did not engage in meaningful visitation in the 
two  visitations  she  attended.    The  record  reflects  that  Mother visited  twice  during  the 
relevant time period but that she was distracted by two telephones during the visits.  With 
these considerations in  mind, we affirm  the trial court’s determination that the evidence 
clearly and convincingly established that Mother abandoned the Child by failure to visit. 

Failure to Remit Support

Abandonment can occur when a parent has “failed to support or [] failed to make 
reasonable  payments  toward  the  support  of  the  child”  for  a  period  of  four  consecutive 
months immediately before the filing of a petition to terminate parental rights.  Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(A)(i).  The statute defines failure to support as a parent’s failure “for a 
period of four (4) consecutive months, to provide monetary support or the failure to provide 
more  than  token  payments  toward  the  support  of  the  child.”    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-
102(1)(D).  By  statute,  parents  are  expected  to  offer  more  than  “token  support,”  which 
“means  that  the  support,  under  the  circumstances  of  the  individual  case,  is  insignificant 
given  the  parent’s  means.”    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-102(1)(B). Furthermore,  “[e]very 
parent  who  is  eighteen  (18)  years  of  age or  older  is  presumed  to  have  knowledge  of  a 
parent’s legal obligation to support such parent’s child or children.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 
36-1-102(1)(H).

A lack of willfulness can constitute an affirmative defense to the ground of failure 
to support.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(I).  A parent “shall bear the burden of proof 
that the failure to . . . support was not willful” and must establish the lack of willfulness by 
a preponderance of evidence.  Id.  Efforts to frustrate or impede a parent’s visitation do not 
- 6 -

justify a parent’s failure to financially support a child.  In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.

There is no dispute that Mother remitted $1,220 in child support during the pertinent 
time period.  However, $1,200 of the support rendered was taken from Mother’s stimulus 
check without her consent.  Mother remitted the remaining $20 from her own funds.  The 
trial court found that Mother’s payments via the stimulus check and the $20 of her own 
funds were token in nature given her inability to consent to the application of her stimulus 
check  to  her  support  arrearage and  her  overall  ability  to  work.    The  record  reflects  that 
Mother  was  largely  unemployed  throughout  the  custodial  episode  and  that  her  own 
residence did not have running water.  Without further information concerning Mother’s 
ability to remit payment, we cannot say that her support payments were token in nature.  
We reverse this ground of termination.  This conclusion does not end our inquiry as only 
one ground of termination is required to support a trial court’s termination decision.  Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 36-1-113(g).

2.

Failure to manifest an ability and willingness to assume custody

The trial court found that Petitioners had proven by clear and convincing evidence 
that Mother’s parental rights should be terminated pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated 
section 36-1-113(g)(14), which provides as follows:

A  legal  parent  or  guardian  has  failed  to  manifest,  by  act  or  omission,  an 
ability  and  willingness  to  personally  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  or 
financial responsibility of the child, and placing the child in the person’s legal 
and physical custody would pose a risk of substantial harm to the physical or 
psychological welfare of the child.

Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-113(g)(14).  This  ground  requires  the  petitioner  to  prove  two 
elements by clear and convincing evidence.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(c)(1), (g)(14). 
First, a petitioner must prove that the parent failed to manifest “an ability and willingness 
to personally assume legal and physical custody or financial responsibility of the child.”  
Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(g)(14).  Second, a petitioner must prove that placing the child 
in  the  parent’s  “legal  and  physical  custody  would  pose  a  risk  of  substantial  harm  to  the 
physical or psychological welfare of the child.”  Id.

As to the first element, our Supreme Court instructed as follows: 

[S]ection  36-1-113(g)(14)  places  a  conjunctive  obligation  on  a  parent  or 
guardian  to  manifest  both  an  ability  and  willingness  to  personally  assume 
legal and physical custody or financial responsibility for the child.  If a person 
seeking to terminate parental rights proves by clear and convincing proof that 
a parent or guardian has failed to manifest either ability or willingness, then 
the first prong of the statute is satisfied.
- 7 -

In re Neveah M., 614 S.W.3d 659, 677 (Tenn. 2020) (citation omitted) (resolving the split 
in authority regarding whether parental rights can be terminated if a parent has manifested 
a willingness, but not an ability to personally assume legal and physical custody or financial 
responsibility for the child).  

As to the second element, whether placing the child in the parent’s custody “would 
pose a risk of substantial harm to the physical or psychological welfare of the child,” we 
have explained:

The courts have not undertaken to define the circumstances that pose a risk 
of  substantial  harm  to  a  child.  These  circumstances  are  not  amenable  to 
precise definition because of the variability of human conduct.  However, the 
use  of  the  modifier  “substantial”  indicates  two  things.  First,  it  connotes  a 
real hazard or danger that is not minor, trivial, or insignificant. Second, it 
indicates that the harm must be more than a theoretical possibility.  While 
the harm need not be inevitable, it must be sufficiently probable to prompt a 
reasonable person to believe that the harm will occur more likely than not.

In re Virgil W., No. E2018-00091-COA-R3-PT, 2018 WL 4931470, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
Oct. 11, 2018) (quoting Ray, 83 S.W.3d at 732).

The  trial  court  offered  the  following  findings  in  support  of  its  application  of  this 

statutory ground: 

dirty, 

unbathed, 

[C]hild  was  malnourished, 

The 
underweight, 
underdeveloped,  jaundiced,  and  suffering  from  squalid  living  conditions 
while  in  [Mother’s] care.    [Mother]  has  been  unable  to  maintain  gainful 
employment for longer than a few days at a time.  [Mother] has not fulfilled 
her  child  support  obligations.    [She]  has  been  distracted  by  and  more 
interested in her cellphones at visitation than the [C]hild.  [She] has not taken 
action to create a meaningful relationship with the [C]hild.  [She] is not able 
to take care of herself, much less the [Child].  Moreover, [the Child] suffers 
from  epilepsy  and  other  developmental  and  learning  disorders  that  require 
additional attention and care.  

From  these  facts,  we  agree  with  the  trial  court  that  Mother  displayed  an  overall  lack  of 
willingness  and  ability  to  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  of  the  Child.    The  record
further supports  a  finding  that  placing  the Child with  Mother would  pose  a  risk  of 
substantial physical harm to the Child’s welfare given the evidence of neglect exhibited 
toward the Child prior to removal and Mother’s failure to establish her ability to remedy 
these concerns of neglect by evidencing her ability to care for the Child.  We affirm the 
court’s finding on this issue.

B.

Having concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence supporting at least 
one statutory ground of termination, we must consider whether termination was in the best 
interest of the Child.  Effective April 22, 2021, the General Assembly amended Tennessee 
Code  Annotated  §  36-1-113(i)  by  deleting  the  previous  subsection  in  its  entirety  and 
substituting  a  new  subsection  providing,  inter  alia,  twenty  factors  to  be  considered  in 
determining whether termination is in the best interest of the child.  See 2021 Tenn. Pub. 
Acts,  Ch.  190  §  1  (S.B.  205).  The  amended  statute  does  not  apply  to  this  action,  filed 
before April 22, 2021.  In re Riley S., No. M2020-01602-COA-R3-PT, 2022 WL 128482, 
at *14 n.10 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 14, 2022) perm. app. denied (Tenn. Mar. 17, 2022).  The 
record reflects that the trial court erroneously applied the amended statute with the newly 
expanded best interest factors.  However, such error was harmless when the old factors are 
included within the amended statute.  See generally In re Da’Moni J., No. E2021-00477-
COA-R3-PT, 2022 WL 214712, at *23 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 25, 2022) perm. app. denied
(Tenn. Apr. 1, 2022).  

The following non-exhaustive list of factors are applicable to this action:

(i)
In determining whether termination of parental or guardianship rights 
is in the best interest of the child . . . the court shall consider, but is not limited 
to, the following:

(1) Whether  the  parent  or  guardian  has  made  such  an  adjustment  of 
circumstance, conduct, or conditions as to make it safe and in the child’s 
best interest to be in the home of the parent or guardian;

(2) Whether  the  parent  or  guardian  has  failed  to  effect  a  lasting 
adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social services agencies 
for  such  duration  of  time  that  lasting  adjustment  does  not  reasonably 
appear possible;4

(3) Whether  the  parent  or  guardian  has  maintained  regular  visitation  or 
other contact with the child;

(4) Whether  a  meaningful  relationship  has  otherwise  been  established 
between the parent or guardian and the child;

                                           

4 In re Kaliyah S., 455 S.W.3d at 555 (“[I]n a termination proceeding, the extent of DCS’s efforts 
to reunify the family is weighed in the court’s best-interest analysis, but proof of reasonable efforts is not a 
precondition to termination of the parental rights of the respondent parent.”).

- 9 -

(5) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely 
to have on the child’s emotional, psychological and medical condition;

(6) Whether  the  parent  or  guardian,  or  other  person  residing  with  the 
parent  or  guardian,  has  shown  brutality,  physical,  sexual,  emotional  or 
psychological abuse, or neglect toward the child, or another child or adult 
in the family or household;

(7) Whether the physical environment of the parent’s or guardian’s home 
is  healthy  and  safe,  whether  there  is  criminal  activity  in  the  home,  or 
whether  there  is  such  use  of  alcohol  or  controlled  substances  as  may 
render the parent or guardian consistently unable to care for the child in 
a safe and stable manner;

(8) Whether  the  parent’s  or  guardian’s  mental  and/or  emotional  status 
would be detrimental to the child or prevent the parent or guardian from 
effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision for the child; 
or

(9) Whether the parent or guardian has paid child support consistent with 
the child support guidelines promulgated by the department pursuant to 
[section] 36-5-101.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(i).  “This list is not exhaustive, and the statute does not require 
a trial court to find the existence of each enumerated factor before it  may conclude that 
terminating a parent’s parental rights is in the best interest of a child.”  In re M.A.R., 183 
S.W.3d 652, 667 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).  The General Assembly has also stated that “when 
the  best  interest[]  of  the  child  and  those  of  the  adults  are  in  conflict,  such  conflict  shall 
always be resolved to favor the rights and the best interest[] of the child, which interests 
are hereby recognized as constitutionally protected.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-101(d); see 
also White  v.  Moody,  171  S.W.3d  187,  194  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2004)  (holding  that  when 
considering a child’s best interest, the court must take the child’s perspective, rather than 
the parent’s).

Mother has failed to ready herself for the Child’s return.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-
113(i)(1).    She  further  failed  to  regularly  visit  or  otherwise  maintain  a  meaningful 
relationship with the Child.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(i)(3), (4).  Meanwhile, the Child
is now in a foster home with parents who wish to adopt her as their own and who have 
taken care of her medical needs.  A change of caretakers at this point would be detrimental 
to  her  medical condition.    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-113(i)(5).    Questions  remain  as  to 
Mother’s ability to provide a safe and stable home for the Child given her past instance of 
neglect and failure to address the concerns that led to neglect.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-
113(i)(6), (7).  With all of the above considerations in mind, we conclude that there was 
- 10 -

clear and convincing evidence to establish that termination of Mother’s parental rights was 
in the best interest of the Child.  We affirm the trial court.

V.

CONCLUSION

The  judgment  of  the  trial  court  is affirmed,  in  part,  and  reversed,  as  to  the  trial 
court’s finding that Mother abandoned the Child by failure to remit child support.  The case 
is  remanded  for  such  further  proceedings as  may  be  necessary.    Costs  of  the  appeal  are 
taxed to the appellant, Summer K.
