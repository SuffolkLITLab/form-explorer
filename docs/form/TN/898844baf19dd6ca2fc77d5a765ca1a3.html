Introduction 

The  Tennessee Supreme Court (the  “Court”) declared  Access  to  Justice its number one 

strategic  priority  in  August  2008  and  officially  launched  its  Access  to  Justice  Initiative  (the 

“Initiative”) later that  year. As an integral part of the Initiative the Court created the Access to 

Justice  Commission  (the  “Commission”)  in  2009.  The  Court  adopted  Supreme  Court  Rule  50 

(“Rule 50”) to provide the Commission with guidance and authority to develop a strategic plan 

for improving access to justice in Tennessee. The strategic plan should educate the public on the 

need  for  legal  representation  to  meet  the  ideal  of  equal  justice  under  the  law,  identify  the 

priorities  to  meet  the  need  of  improved  access  to  justice,  and  include  recommendations  to  the 

Court for projects and programs the Commission determines to be necessary and appropriate for 

enhancing access to justice in Tennessee. The Commission must update the strategic plan every 

two years.  

This  2016  Strategic  Plan  outlines  the  history  and  successes  of  prior  strategic  plans  and 

details the Commission’s vision for the next two years. The Commission is now entering a new 

phase  in  its  existence.  It  has  identified  and  addressed  immediate  needs  and  now  must  position 

itself  as  an  integral  and  coordinating  part  of  the  access  to  justice  culture  in  Tennessee.  The 

Commission  is  very  mindful  that  its  success  is  directly  attributed  to  the  Court’s  unwavering 

commitment to increasing access to justice for Tennessee’s most vulnerable citizens. The Court 

as a whole – and each individual Justice – continuously demonstrates the importance of access to 

justice through presentations and speeches both locally and nationally, participation in meetings 

and training events, and strong encouragement of those involved in access to justice, including 

the  Commission  and  all  of  its  access  to  justice  partners.  Tennessee  remains  one  of  very  few 

states to have  the entire Supreme Court  dedicated to improving meaningful access to  the court 

system and the Commission thanks the Court for its steadfast support.

II. 

Overview of the Commission’s 2010 and 2012 Strategic Plans 

A. 

2010 Strategic Plan.  The  Commission  submitted  its  first  strategic  plan  to  the 

Court in 2010. The Commission focused on Rule 50 directives to craft this Plan. Specifically, it 

set four goals: 

better served; 

1) 

Involve more lawyers and law students in meeting legal needs so that the public is 

2) 

Provide  greater  educational  opportunities  and  resources  for  policymakers,  self-

represented litigants, the community, lawyers, court personnel, and others; 

Make the justice system more user-friendly; 

3) 

4) 

Remove  barriers  to  access  to  justice  including  but  not  limited  to  disability, 

language, literacy, and geography.  

As the Commission navigated through its first years, these four goals served as its guide. 

The  Commission  built  upon  the  Court’s  proactive  approach  to  eliminating  the  barriers  for 

attorneys to perform pro bono work, and a statewide Pro Bono Summit was held in 2011. The 

Pro  Bono  Summit  brought  together  judges,  court  clerks,  law  school  faculty  and  staff,  private 

attorneys, legal aid attorneys, librarians, faith leaders, social service providers, and a wide range 

of  other  stakeholders.  The  attendees  participated  in  specialized  break-out  sessions,  discussing 

and developing initiatives to increase pro bono for their respective communities.  

The Commission unveiled some of its initiatives at the Pro Bono Summit including the 

Pro Bono Clinic in a Box project, that has all the forms and guidance an organization would need 

to  start  a 

free 

legal  advice  clinic.  The 

free  online  civil 

legal  advice  website, 

www.OnlineTNJustice.org,  a  collaboration  between  the  Tennessee  Bar  Association,  the 

Tennessee  Alliance  for  Legal  Services  and  the  Commission,  was  debuted,  and  attendees  were 

able  to  sign  up  as  volunteers  on  the  site.  An  entire  plenary  session  was  devoted  to  how 

2 
 

technology can be used to make it easier for the public to get legal information and legal help. 

The  Court  unveiled  its  stand-alone  website,  www.JusticeForAllTN.com,  and  illustrated  an 

interactive map feature that allows users to click on a county to find contact information for legal 

and social services in their area.  

Also addressed by  the Commission was the growing number of  Tennesseans  who must 

represent themselves because they can’t afford an attorney for civil legal issues, some precluded 

from getting help through a local legal aid office. The Commission developed a packet of plain 

language forms written in a fifth to eighth grade reading level for uncontested divorces when the 

spouses do not have any minor children, have no real property, and no retirement accounts.1 This 

project was a response to multiple surveys from court clerks and legal aid lawyers who identified 

the huge need for family law resources. The Court adopted Supreme Court Rule 52 (“Rule 52”) 

to approve plain language forms as universally acceptable as legally sufficient in all Tennessee 

counties.  The  Commission  created  additional  plain  language  forms  commonly  used  in  general 

sessions court, as general sessions judges and the court clerks reported the majority of litigants in 

that court are self-represented.2 

To  assist  the  front  line  profession  in  helping  self-represented  litigants,  the  Commission 

put  forth  Guidelines  for  Tennessee  Court  Clerks  Who  Assist  Self-Represented  Persons  (the 

“Guidelines”)3. Various court clerks participated in this project, and the Tennessee Court Clerks 

Association  readily  adopted  the  Guidelines.  Under  the  leadership  of  a  general  sessions  judge 

committed to aiding self-represented litigants, the Commission drafted a bench book directed to 

                                                 
1 The plain language divorce forms for uncontested divorces when there are no minor children are available at

give  those  who  could  not  afford  a  civil  attorney  a  better  understanding  of  the  court  process: 

Meeting the Challenges of Self-Represented  Litigants (the “Bench Book”)4 with corresponding 

supplemental  local  rules.  The  Tennessee  General  Sessions  Judges  Conference  approved  the 

Bench  Book  and  supplemental  rules  which  are  both  written  in  plain  language.  The  Guidelines 

and Bench Book are made available on the Administrative Office of the Courts’ website and are 

routinely distributed to the court clerks and general sessions judges at their training events.  

B. 

2012 Strategic Plan.  When the Commission met to craft its 2012 Strategic Plan, 

it  determined  that  the  primary  objectives  of  the  2012  Strategic  Plan  were  to  provide  quality 

representation to indigent Tennesseans, and create better ways to connect clients with a lawyer 

for civil needs. It focused on the first goal of the 2010 Strategic Plan as the first step in meeting 

the primary objectives, to better serve the public by involving more lawyers and law students in 

meeting  legal  needs.  The  Commission  decided  to  quantify  this  goal,  on  or  before  January  1, 

2015,  as  50%  of  licensed  attorneys  residing  in  Tennessee  would  provide  pro  bono  services  as 

defined  by  the  Court  at  an  average  of  50  hours  per  year.  This  goal  would  be  measured  by 

attorneys who voluntarily report their pro bono work when they renew their attorney license with 

the Board of Professional Responsibility.  

At  the  writing  of  this  Plan,  41.56%  of  Tennessee  attorneys  reported  in  2015  that  they 

provided 568,170 hours of pro bono service in 2014, at an average of 74.61 hours per reporting 

attorney.5 The percentage of Tennessee attorneys reporting pro bono work is up slightly, by .5%, 

from  last  year.  The  highest  percentage  rate  that  the  Commission  has  tracked  was  47.20%  of 

Tennessee attorneys reporting pro bono work in 2012. Since 2011, when the Commission began 

                                                 
4 The Bench Book is available at http://www.tncourts.gov/administration/judicial-resources/forms-documents/other-
forms-resources.  
5 Attorney pro bono reporting data is available in the 2015 Pro Bono Report attached as Appendix XX.  Pro Bono 
Reports from prior years are available at http://www.tncourts.gov/programs/access-justice.  

4 
 

tracking  the  amount  of  pro  bono  work  reported  by  Tennessee  attorneys,  the  percentage  of 

reporting attorneys has been greater than 40%.  

Recruiting new lawyers to do pro bono work was paramount to expanding the scope of 

free legal services available to low income Tennesseans. The 2003 Legal Needs Study6 showed 

that  there  were  over  one  million  Tennesseans  who  qualified  for  free  legal  assistance.  At  that 

time,  there  were  only  roughly  80  lawyers  employed  at  legal  aid  organizations  in  Tennessee 

funded by the Legal Services Corporation. There was no way that these 80 lawyers could meet 

the stated need. The Commission outlined objectives in the 2012 Strategic Plan that were either 

met or surpassed. The number of law firms that adopted pro bono policies increased by 15 with 

two  additional  firms  in  the  process  of  adopting  pro  bono  policies  at  the  close  of  the  2012 

Strategic  Plan.  Pillar  Law  Firm  models  were  launched  in  Memphis  and  Knoxville,  and 

Chattanooga  was  in  the  process  of  launching  its  model.  The  Pillar  Law  Firm  model  is  one 

through which firms commit to accept pro bono cases on a specific legal issue referred from the 

local legal aid office. The legal aid office trains the firms’ lawyers on that specific legal issue. 

The  Commission  assisted  the  TBA  in  planning  of  the  first  Law  School  Pro  Bono  &  Public 

Interest Conference at Belmont College of Law in January 2013. One noteworthy result of this 

Conference  is  the  law  schools  have  partnered  together  on  Alternative  Spring  Break  projects  to 

provide on-going legal representation to low income Tennesseans. The TBA now sponsors this 

annual meeting, while the Commission remains a strong supporter and participant.  

The  Commission’s  Pro  Bono  Advisory  Committee  proposed  a  pro  bono  recognition 

program,  Attorneys  for  Justice,  whereby  individual  attorneys  who  do  50  or  more  hours  of  pro 

bono  service  in  a  calendar  year  are  recognized  by  the  Court.  The  Court  also  recognizes  law 

offices  with  an  average  of  50  hours  or  pro  bono  work  per  attorney  in  a  calendar  year.  To 
                                                 
6 The 2003 Legal Needs Study is available at http://justiceforalltn.org/i-can-help/resources-and-guidelines.   

5 
 

encourage  more  law  students  to  become  involved  in  doing  pro  bono  work,  the  proposal  also 

included a recognition program for them, Law Students for Justice. Law students who provide 50 

or more hours of pro bono work during their law school career are recognized. Each attorney or 

law student who is recognized receives certificate signed by all of the Justices on the Court. He 

or  she  also  receives  an  electronic  version  of  the  recognition  seal  that  may  be  used  on  their 

website, letterhead, and other marketing material. Lastly, the Court recognizes the attorneys, law 

offices, and law students at regional events to celebrate their pro bono efforts and encourage their 

peers to participate.  

Next the Commission focused on how to educate the newly-recruited attorneys. Based on 

the  2003  Legal  Needs  Study,  the  Commission  determined  that  family  law  and  debtor/creditor 

issues are High Needs areas of law, as low income Tennesseans frequently experience problems 

in these issues. The Commission set out to create an online curriculum on High Needs areas of 

law  for  pro  bono  attorneys  to  familiarize  themselves  with  these  subjects  if  they  are  outside  of 

their day-to-day practice. The videos are available to attorneys free of charge. Currently there are 

over ten videos available on the access to justice website and the Commission continues to add to 

the  curriculum.7  The  Commission  emphasized  the  Pillar  Law  Firm  model  as  another  way  to 

educate pro bono attorneys on High Needs areas of law 

The  Commission  officially  indicated  its  intent  to  propose  to  the  Commission  on 

Continuing Legal Education and Specialization (the “CLE Commission”) that excess CLE funds 

be designated by the CLE Commission and the Court to provide for development and promotion 

of the High Needs CLE training and the other access to justice initiatives.  The cost to develop 

the  curriculum  ended  up  being  very  nominal  due  to  the  generosity  of  the  Tennessee  Bar 

Association. The TBA provided its production studio and services free of charge for some of the 
                                                 
7 The attorney education videos are available at http://www.justiceforalltn.com/videos.  

6 
 

videos. Other videos are recordings of live training sessions sponsored by the Commission which 

have proven to be a very successful method to both recruit and train new pro bono lawyers.  

The Commission made two requests to the CLE Commission for specific access to justice 

initiatives. The first was to hire a Pro Bono Coordinator to cultivate, monitor, and report new pro 

bono  initiatives.  The  Faith-Based  Initiatives  Advisory  Committee  identified  the  need  for 

statewide  pro  bono  coordination  during  the  formation  of  its  partnership  with  the  United 

Methodist Church. Many of the pastors indicated that pro bono resources are scarce, particularly 

in  rural  areas  of  the  state.  They  also  indicated  that  face-to-face  interaction  is  key  to  securing 

commitment  by  potential  partners.  These  specific  needs  could  not  be  met  by  the  Access  to 

Justice  Coordinator  alone.  While  the  need  for  the  position  was  identified  by  the  Faith-Based 

Initiatives  Committee,  the  position  is  not  limited  to  faith-based  projects.  The  Pro  Bono 

Coordinator works with  non-religious institutions to develop  new  pro bono  programs.  The Pro 

Bono Coordinator maintains a statewide directory of pro bono and legal service programs8 and 

uses that database to identify pockets of the state where pro bono resources are lacking.  

The  CLE  Commission’s  commitment  to  access  to  justice  enabled  the  Commission  to 

create the Tennessee Faith & Justice Alliance (the “TFJA”).9 The TFJA is an alliance of faith-

based groups in Tennessee who commit to providing legal assistance to their congregations and 

communities.  The  goal is to attract attorneys  who are  not  currently  involved  in  pro bono work 

and  to  connect  them  with  low  income  Tennesseans  in  need  of  legal  services.  The  assumption 

behind the program is that people in need will go to their houses of worship for help. Some of the 

collaborative projects created by the TFJA are training sessions for clergy to help them identify 

legal  issues  when  listening  to  their  parishioners,  using  a  Referral  Model  designed  to  pair 

                                                 
8 The statewide pro bono and legal service programs is available at http://www.justiceforalltn.com/resource/legal-
clinics-tennessee.   
9 Additional information on the TFJA is available at http://www.justiceforalltn.com/i-can-help/faith-based-initiative.

volunteer lawyers with congregants in need, establishing inter-faith free legal advice clinics, and 

providing community education.  

The  second  request  the  Commission  made  to  the  CLE  Commission  addresses  the 

Commission’s  emphasis  on  connecting  people  in  need  with  pro  bono  lawyers  and  other  legal 

services.  As  part  of  the  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Commission  explored  the  feasibility  of 

establishing  a  statewide  toll  free  information  phone  line,  staffed  by  lawyers,  which  the  public 

could access for information on available resources. The Chair of the Commission and the ATJ 

Coordinator  attended  numerous  training  sessions  providing  information  on  similar  information 

lines and consulted with many access to justice stakeholders at the local, state, and national level. 

After much  review,  the  Commission  determined that TALS was the most appropriate entity to 

host  the  information  line,  1-888-aLEGALz,  and  TALS  welcomed  this  addition  to  its 

programming. The CLE Commission funded the information line attorney beginning in January 

2013 and continues to support the position. TALS re-branded the information line with the help 

of  the  Commission’s  Public  Awareness  Advisory  Committee  in  2015  to  Help4TN.  In  January 

2016, just three years after its launch, 1-844-Help4TN helped its 10,000th caller.  

While  the  2012  Strategic  Plan  had  a  primary  focus  to  increase  the  amount  of  pro  bono 

work  provided  across  the  state,  the  Commission  recognized  inevitably  that  some  Tennesseans 

will not have access to pro bono help. Therefore it did include projects designed to assist self-

represented  litigants.  The  Commission  produced  a  series  of  educational  videos  for  self-

represented  litigants  on  specific  legal  issues  and  the  court  process  in  general.10  Throughout  its 

existence,  the  Commission  has  surveyed  court  clerks,  judges,  and  others  who  frequently 

encounter  self-represented  litigants.  The  majority  of  survey  respondents  express  the  need  for 

guidance  and  resources  to  provide  service  effectively  to  self-represented  litigants.  The 
                                                 
10 The videos for self-represented litigants are available at http://www.justiceforalltn.com/videos.  

8 
 

Commission  developed  a  policy  clearly  defining  legal  information  and  legal  advice.11  This 

policy guides court staff, clerks, and others who regularly assist people who represent themselves 

in  legal  matters.  The  Commission  created  additional  guidance  for  court  clerks  and  staff  for 

signage  to  help  self-represented  litigants  navigate  the  courthouse.12  Plain  language  forms  and 

instructional  resources  continue  to  be  one  of  the  Commission’s  priorities  to  assist  self-

represented litigants.  

III.  Accomplishments and Highlights of the 2014 Strategic Plan. 

The 2014 Strategic Plan set forth additional goals and initiatives to aid and expedite the 

Court's dynamic and ongoing Access to Justice campaign. The Commission continued its focus 

on its first goal: to involve more lawyers and law students in meeting legal needs the better serve 

the  public.  Key  to  implementation  of  this  goal  is  a  more  comprehensive  pro  bono  delivery 

system  across  the  state;  which  has  taken  shape  through  the  establishment  of  1-888-aLEGALz, 

now 1-844-Help4TN, and the publication of the annual pro bono report. The 2014 Strategic Plan 

also addressed the necessity for further public outreach and for enhanced awareness of existing 

access to justice resources for self-represented individuals and the community at large. Finally, 

the  2014  Plan  addressed  the  Commission's  commitment  to  careful  measurement  of  the 

effectiveness  of  initiatives,  including  collaborative  efforts  to  assist  stakeholders  in  aiming 

resources to the programs that most directly address the critical needs of our citizens. 

A. 

Assess  Legal  Needs.  The  Commission  and  other  access  to  justice  stakeholders 

rely  on  statistics  detailing  the  civil  legal  needs  of  low  income  Tennesseans.  Prior  to  the  2014 

Strategic  Plan,  the  most-recent  legal  needs  study  was  conducted  in  2003.  In  order  for  the

Commission  and  its  partners  to  refine  existing  programs  and  launch  new  initiatives  that  will 

impact  the  most  Tennesseans  in  the  most  profound  way,  the  Commission  sought  funding  to 

update the statewide legal needs assessment. The Ansley Fund of the Frist Foundation provided a 

generous  grant, and a new legal  needs study was released in 2014 in collaboration with  TALS 

and  the  TBA.13  The  Commission  used  this  study  to  develop  this  strategic  plan,  and  each 

Advisory Committee has used the data to prioritize initiatives and address need.  

B. 

Disseminate  Information  and  Increase  Use  of  Existing  Resources.  The 

Commission  believed  that  many  of  the  existing  resources,  such  as  www.OnlineTNJustice.org 

and  the  toll  free  legal  information  line,  1-844-Help4TN,  were  underutilized.  It  declared  in  the 

2014  Strategic  Plan  that  it  would  re-populate  a  stand-alone  Public  Awareness  Committee  to 

focus on two crucial fronts. The first was to make the public aware of existing resources and the 

second was to insure lawyers are aware of opportunities to provide pro bono services.  

The Public Awareness Committee is credited with recommending that aLEGALz be re-

branded  so  that  the  name  resonates  with  the  general  public.  aLEGALz  became  Help4TN.  It 

further recommended that a website be re-branded or created with  the  same name to reach the 

public through the internet. TALS re-branded its Legal Information for Tennesseans website to 

www.Help4TN.org.  The  website  is  a  portal  to  direct  users  to  the  appropriate  resources.  The 

Public Awareness Committee, with the help of ATJ Commissioner Tony Seaton, created a public 

service  announcement  featuring  Justice  Cornelia  A.  Clark.  The  PSA  informs  the  public  of  the 

website,  and  provides  a  brief  description  of  the  information  available  on  the  site.  The  PSA  is 

already airing in areas around the state. 

The Commission set a specific goal to increase referrals by LSC-funded organizations to 

the  legal  information  hotline  by  10%  per  year.  Impetus  for  the  goal  was  recognition  that  the

hotline can help people by providing limited legal advice or referring them to another resource 

when legal  aid  cannot take their case. The Help4TN phone line collects some data from  users. 

Legal  aid  is  consistently  in  the  top  two  referral  sources.  A  sample  of  509  callers  from  2015 

indicates that 30% of users heard about the helpline from legal aid, 25% from court clerks, 11% 

from private attorneys, 7% from an agency, and 7% from the internet.  

A  second  specific  goal  set  by  the  Commission  was  to  drive  a  10%  increase  in  use  of 

existing resources. Re-branding the helpline and the legal information website to Help4TN were 

both  actions  taken  to  help  meet  this  goal.  The  website,  www.Help4TN.org,  was  added  to 

www.KidCentraltn.com, a one-stop shop for families to connect with important information and 

resources.  The  Governor’s  Children’s  Cabinet,  led  by  Gov.  Bill  Haslam  and  First  Lady  Crissy 

Haslam,  developed  the  website.  TALS  created  flyers  with  information  for  both  the  Help4TN 

helpline and website, which were distributed to court clerks,  general sessions judges,  and legal 

aid and social workers.14 The  Education Advisory Committee developed a poster  for  the court 

clerks to post with the Help4TN helpline and website information.15 The poster also included the 

websites  www.OnlineTNJustice.org  and  www.JusticeForAllTN.com.  Due  to  these  efforts,  the 

Help4TN helpline usage increased by 25%. The usage of www.OnlineTNJustice.org increased as 

well. The number of users increased by 35%, the number of return users increased by 22%, and 

the number of attorney volunteers increased by 10%.  

C. 

Attorney  Education.  The  Commission  emphasized  its  goal  to  increase  the 

amount of pro bono work carried out by attorneys by creating training opportunities for volunteer 

attorneys.  Specifically,  a  goal  was  set  for  five  new  attorney  education  videos  as  part  of  a  core 

curriculum;  a  protocol  was  developed  to  handle  production  of  time-sensitive  videos.  The 

                                                 
14 The informational flyer is available at http://www.tals.org/sites/tals.org/files/HELP4TN.org%20Poster.pdf.

11 
 

protocol was finalized and approved in September 2014. The Commission exceeded the goal of 

creating five  new  core  attorney  education videos. There  are now  ten  attorney education videos 

available  on  www.JusticeForAllTN.com.  Subjects 

include 

immigration,  expungement, 

healthcare, general sessions cases, family law, debt collection, and landlord/tenant issues.  

In  addition,  the  Commission  identified  the  need  to  communicate  directly  to  Tennessee 

lawyers  to  inform  them  of  needs,  available  resources,  pro  bono  volunteer  opportunities,  and 

Court  recognition  programs.  The  first  Access  to  Justice  Update  was  sent  out  in  July  2014.  It 

provided  information  on  the  newly-adopted  Supreme  Court  pro  bono  recognition  program,  the 

legal helpline, and links to various pro bono opportunities. The second Update was distributed in 

July 2015. It included information on applying to be recognized as an Attorney for Justice and 

notified the bar that the name of the helpline had been changed to Help4TN. 

D. 

Target the Needs of Rural Tennesseans. The legal needs of rural Tennesseans 

was a strategic  focus of  the  2014 Strategic Plan.  In  2013, the AOC hosted an  intern seeking a 

master’s  degree  in  social  work.  The  intern  conducted  a  study  targeted  at  learning  the  unique 

needs of Tennesseans living in rural areas. The study, Understanding the Unmet Need: A Study 

of  the  Tennessee  Rural  Population’s  Access  to  Legal  Assistance16,  underscored  that  rural 

Tennesseans  have  difficulty  getting  to  legal  services  due  to  lack  of  transportation,  gas  money, 

medical issues, childcare and unfamiliarity with areas where clinics are held. To address some of 

these  obstacles,  the  Commission  set  an  ambitious  goal  to  establish  a  functioning,  regularly 

scheduled pro bono  legal advice  clinic  in every judicial  district. When the  2014 Strategic Plan 

went  into  effect,  about  a  third  of  the  thirty-three  judicial  districts  were  without  recurring  legal 

advice  clinics.  Now  there  are  only  five  judicial  districts  without  a  recurring  legal  clinic.  The 

remaining districts are located in West Tennessee where resources are very scarce.

12 
 

E. 

Tennessee Faith and Justice Alliance (TFJA) and Faith-Based Initiative.  The 

Commission hosted the first-ever statewide gathering of faith-based organizations and pro bono 

lawyers with a  common  interest  in assisting Tennesseans with civil legal problems on April 7, 

2014,  at  Lipscomb  University  in  Nashville,  TN.  Almost  100  people  came  together  to  listen  to 

nationally renowned speakers on partnerships between the faith-based community and the legal 

community. Break  out  groups  worked to develop ways to collaborate on  new projects to serve 

their communities. Over twenty new attorney and non-attorney volunteers were recruited to join 

the TFJA at the Summit. 

Key  to  a  successful  faith-based  program  is  to  have  a  champion  from  within  the 

organization  to  promote  the  program,  recruit  volunteers,  and  make  sure  that  the  initiative  is 

functioning properly. The Commission devoted staff resources to identifying champions and to 

organizations  with  a  well-functioning  champion  in  place.  The  TFJA  provides  a  template  for 

establishing an initiative and trains the champions. Through this process, the Commission added 

20 new functioning faith-based programs to the TFJA.  

With  an  ABA  Innovation  Grant  the  Commission  received  in  2013,  the  Commission 

developed  a  faith-based  prototype  for  legal  outreach  to  faith  organizations  to  be  replicated 

throughout the state. The Innovation Grant focused on two projects targeted at increasing faith-

based pro bono programs in rural areas, expanding the referral model piloted by the Tennessee 

Conference of the United Methodist Church and the TFJA, creating a new faith-based clinic in a 

rural  county.  The  referral  model  served  as  the  prototype  for  future  opportunities.  The 

Commission  now  has  a  Referral  Model  training  packet  and  training  packets  for  volunteer 

attorneys in all three grand divisions.17

help/faith-based-initiative.

F. 

Established  Access  to  Justice  Fund.  The  2014  Strategic  Plan  included  a  goal 

that  the  Commission  recommend  to  the  Court  required  pro  bono  reporting.  The  Commission 

petitioned  the  Court  in  November  2014  to  amend  Supreme  Court  Rule  9  to  provide  for 

mandatory pro bono reporting. The petition focused on the Commission’s goal of measuring its 

effectiveness,  which  would  go  hand-in-hand  with  the  Legal  Needs  Study  to  assist  the 

Commission in matching low income Tennesseans with civil legal needs to the appropriate pro 

bono program. The petition included an additional request to provide attorneys with the option to 

voluntarily donate to a fund to support access to justice programs (the “Access to Justice Fund”) 

when they renewed their legal license with the Board of Professional Responsibility. Ultimately 

the  Court  approved  the  establishment  of  the  Access  to  Justice  Fund  but  declined  to  adopt 

mandatory  pro  bono  reporting.  Beginning  on  July  1,  2015,  attorneys  were  able  to  voluntarily 

contribute to the Access to Justice Fund. By June 1, 2016, over $75,000 had been donated. The 

first distributions were made in June 2016 to organizations that provide direct civil legal services 

to low income Tennesseans.  

G. 

Automated Court  Forms.  The Commission noted that despite all of the many 

successful  existing  and  planned  pro  bono  initiatives  there  still  is  a  segment  of  low  income 

Tennesseans  who  must  represent  themselves  in  legal  matters.  Therefore  the  Commission 

declared that plain language forms shall continue to be an important resource. The Commission 

went a step further, declared it would make a recommendation to the Court on the viability of an 

automated  court  form  program  in  Tennessee  and  whether  to  move  forward  to  adopt  such 

program. The “do-it-yourself” program, similar to “TurboTax®” would ask the self-represented 

litigants  a  series  of  questions  and  use  the  answers  to  populate  the  necessary  forms.  The 

Commission determined that TALS is the proper agency to host this program and provided seed 

14 
 

money to automate the  Supreme Court-approved plain language divorce forms  for uncontested 

divorces when there is no property, no retirement, and no minor children. This project is in the 

pilot process and will be released to the general public in 2016.   

H. 

Increase Pro Bono Mediation. Part of the Commission’s charge in Rule 50 is to 

encourage the Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission (the “ADR Commission”) and other 

groups to provide pro bono and reduced-rate mediation services to self-represented litigants, and 

to  litigants  with  modest  means.  In  2014,  the  Commission  created  a  Mediation  Advisory 

Committee to work with the ADR Commission and facilitate initiatives of its own. The Chair of 

the  Mediation  Advisory  Committee  serves  as  a  liaison  with  the  ADR  Commission  and  has 

assisted  the  ADR  Commission  to  form  a  pro  bono  mediation  subcommittee  of  its  own.  The 

Committee  worked  to  replicate  the  mediator  of  the  day  program  and  launched  a  successful 

program in Madison County. The Committee is planning a pilot project with Vanderbilt Medical 

Center to use mediation to assist patients with outstanding medical bills.  

I. 

Pro Bono Recognition. For the first time, the Commission assisted the Court in 

hosting public recognition events in Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville in October of 2014. The 

events  provided  the  Court  with  the  opportunity  to  publicly  recognize  the  Attorneys  for  Justice 

and Law Students for Justice. The event in Nashville was successful due to the partnership with 

the  Commission  and  Belmont  University  College  of  Law,  where  the  event  was  held.  Building 

upon  this  success,  the  Commission  partnered  with  local  organizations  for  all  of  the  regional 

events  in  2015,  including  maintaining  its  partnership  with  Belmont  for  the  Nashville  event.  In 

Memphis, the Commission partnered with the Memphis Bar Association and in Johnson City, it 

partnered with Legal Aid of East Tennessee.  

15 
 

In 2014, 264 attorneys were recognized as Attorneys for Justice for providing more than 

50 hours of pro bono work in the prior calendar year. Ninety-five law students were recognized 

as Law  Students for Justice for  doing over 50  hours of pro  bono work  during their  law  school 

careers.  The  number  of  recognition  recipients  increased  in  2015.  Three  hundred  and  seventy-

eight attorneys were recognized as Attorneys for Justice and 117 law students were recognized as 

Law  Students  for  Justice.  The  Commission  publicized  the  recognition  program  through 

coordinated  outreach  to  attorneys  through  state  and  local  bar  associations  and  through  a  direct 

emailing.  Partnering  with  local  groups  also  boosted  the  number  of  attorneys  recognized  as  the 

local organization provided members with information on application for recognition. All of the 

public recognition events were very positively received and publicized.  

J. 

Data  Collection  and  Management.  The  2014  Strategic  Plan  contained  an 

essential  focus  not  as  present  in  the  prior  plans,  to  collect  data  and  feedback  on  the 

Commission’s initiatives  and projects.  In 2014, the Commission had been  in existence for five 

years  and  was  to  measure  its  success  for  the  first  time.   The  Commission  set  out  to  determine 

which  of  its  programs  were  successful  and  should  be  replicated,  which  ones  needed  to  be 

improved, and which ones should be discontinued to redirect valuable resources.  

The  Pro  Bono  Advisory  Committee  developed  a  clinic  provider  survey  to  collect 

information from the providers regarding the number of attorney and non-attorney volunteers at 

each clinic and the number of clients seen.18 The survey sought information on the types of legal 

issues  handled,  and  what  advice  was  given  to  the  clients.  A  similar  survey  was  designed  for 

TFJA  members  with  the  Referral  Model  pro  bono  program  to  obtain  information  from  the 

volunteer attorneys  on the types of services the  provided.19 The information gathered  from the 

                                                 
18 The clinic provider survey is available at http://justiceforalltn.org/node/365.  
19 TFJA member surveys are available at http://justiceforalltn.org/i-can-help/faith-based-initiative.  

16 
 

clinic providers and the TFJA members was incorporated into the annual Pro Bono Report. Other 

sections  have  been  added  to  the  Pro  Bono  Report.  The  2015  Pro  Bono  Report  now  contains 

charts  and  graphs  to  illustrate  the  data  contained  therein.  The  2015  Pro  Bono  Report  marks  a 

departure from the previous pro bono report formats. The goal of the new format is to encourage 

access to justice stakeholders to be able to use the statistics in the report when making strategic 

decisions  and  to  provide  the  general  public  with  a  better  understanding  of  the  pro  bono  work 

being done in Tennessee.  

IV. 

The Commission’s Strategic Vision 

When  the  Commission  met  to  discuss  developing  its  2016  Strategic  Plan,  many  new 

Commission  members  joined  the  group  for  the  first  time.  The  Commission  recognized  it  is 

entering  a  new  phase  in  its  existence  and  it  seeks  to  honor  the  legacy  of  service  of  preceding 

members  by  continuing  the  momentum  of  successful  initiatives.  After  seven  years,  the 

Commission is no longer new to the access to justice community in Tennessee. It is recognized 

for its initiatives; it  has become  an  integral part  of the access to justice culture.  This Plan will 

guide  the  Commission  in  its  developing  role,  to  position  itself  as  a  statewide  “think  tank.”  Its 

focus is to enhance existing initiatives and create new opportunities in Tennessee, and to serve as 

a  national  repository  on  access  to  justice  resources.  Drawing  from  the  Commission’s  first 

strategic  plan,  the  Commission  will  further  its  role  as  the  statewide  coordinating  arm  for 

communications on legal aid, pro bono, and self-represented litigant resources.  

The Commission sees several opportunities in continuing its work: to gain understanding 

of  the  many  pro  bono  and  self-represented  litigant  initiatives  throughout  Tennessee,  to  better 

identify  and  leverage  potential  collaborations,  to  develop  educational  materials,  to  replicate 

initiatives in underserved areas, and to reach the general public on available resources for civil 

legal help. To achieve this goal, the Commission will rely upon the demonstrated support of the 

17 
 

Court, and access to justice partners. The Commission will continue its good relationships with 

the TBA, TALS, judges, court clerks and court staff, mediators, the LSC-funded and non-LSC-

funded legal aid providers, faith-based organizations, law schools, and social service providers. 

Members  of  these  groups  and  other  key  players  will  be  represented  on  the  Commission’s 

Advisory Committees.  

V. 

Summary of Recommendations for the 2016-2018 Strategic Plan. 

A. 

Disseminate Information About Existing Resources. The Commission believes 

that despite its efforts and those of other access to justice partners, there remains a large segment 

of the general public unaware of the existing resources for help with their civil legal needs. Four 

primary avenues exist for people to get legal information and legal help:  

1)  https://tn.freelegalanswers.org (previously www.OnlineTNJustice.org),20  

2)  www.JusticeForAllTN.com,  

3)  www.Help4TN.org, and  

4)  1-844-Help4TN.  

Yet  the  2014  Legal  Needs  Study  showed  that  people  with  civil legal  problems  are  unaware  of 

these resources. Therefore the Commission has determined that public awareness of the existing 

resources will continue to be a priority over the next two years. The website, www.Help4TN.org, 

will serve as the primary point of entry for low income Tennesseans to access civil legal help.  

The Commission determined that it must actively disseminate printed materials in a more 

purposeful way across the state. To date, most of the Commission’s efforts to share information 

with the  general public  have focused on providing  printed materials  to  groups,  including court 

clerks, judges, bar associations, legal aid providers and pro bono programs, with the request that 

                                                 
20 Online Tennessee Justice changed its name to Tennessee Free Legal Answers in August 2016 when the American 
Bar Association launched ABA Free Legal Answers.  ABA Free Legal Answers is a national program based off the 
Online Tennessee Justice website.   

18 
 

those groups pass on the information to members of the public. While this strategy was sufficient 

when the  four statewide resources  were  under  development,  it  did not  include a  mechanism to 

direct information to low income Tennesseans who are not yet involved in the legal system. The 

2014  Legal  Needs  Study  shows  that  many  low  income  Tennesseans  never  sought  any  type  of 

legal help because they didn’t think it was worth their time and their civil legal problem is part of 

their  everyday  life.  The  Commission  discussed  how  to  get  printed  materials  on  available  legal 

resources into the hands of those who are not  yet in the court system and would not otherwise 

actively seek help.  

The  Commission  determined  to  broaden  its  current  strategy  to  include  other  existing 

programs  as  portals  to  provide  civil  legal  information  to  the  public.  Organizations  such  as  the 

Boys and Girls Clubs and the Red Cross will be given information that can be distributed to the 

public  on  how  to  find  legal  help.  Businesses  with  heavy  foot  traffic  such  as  barber  shops  and 

laundry  mats  will  be  provided  with  a  posters  or  printed  material  that  patrons  can  view  while 

waiting or take with them. The Commission believes that casting a wider net on locations where 

materials on civil legal help are readily available will reach people who have a problem but are 

not  yet  in  the  court  system.  The  expanded  strategy  will  also  reach  those  who  do  not  currently 

have  a  civil  legal  problem  and  provide  them  with  information  on  how  to  get  help  if  they 

experience one in the future.  

Goal:  

Identify portals/access points to reach low income Tennesseans and 

develop and distribute printed materials to those locations. 

Deadline:  

 

March 2017 

Responsibility:  

Education Committee 

19 
 

The Commission will continue to provide information to existing pro bono legal advice 

clinics and programs and TFJA events. In addition to working through the point person for each 

initiative,  the  Commission  will  identify  community  leaders  and  equip  them  with  printed 

materials  for  dissemination  to  their  colleagues  and  the  general  public.  The  TFJA  sponsors 

numerous public education events each year, therefore it does reach members of the public who 

are not yet in the court system. The Commission will be more focused on content of the printed 

materials that it creates for distribution at these events. 

Goal:  

Develop and have available printed resources at every clinic and 

TFJA event throughout the state. 

Deadline:  

 

March 2017 

Responsibility:  

Education Committee 

Both www.tn.freelegalanswers.org and 1-844-Help4TN have a mechanism for measuring 

use of each resource and to track how the user learned of the resource. The Commission will rely 

upon the expertise of the  TALS staff  for periodic reports on these programs. The Commission 

will  use  Google  analytics  to  gain  insight  into  the  number  of  visits,  the  links  clicked,  and  the 

documents  downloaded  for  both  the  www.JusticeForAllTN.com  and  the  www.Help4TN.org 

websites. The Commission will track the frequency viability the public service announcement is 

aired  and  the  viewing  area  to  determine  its  impact  on  the  use  of  these  resources.  When  the 

automatic forms are released, there will be a built-in mechanism to track the number of times the 

divorce packet is generated.   

Goal:  

Increase use of existing resources by 10%

B. 

Assume  Role  of  Statewide  Coordinator  to  Create  a  Communications  Plan 

Encompassing Civil Legal Aid, Pro Bono and Access to Justice Stakeholders. In addition to 

the general public not being aware of existing resources, the Commission believes there are legal 

professionals  who  can  help  low  income  Tennesseans  who  are  unaware  of  the  volunteer 

opportunities  and  resources  are  available  to  them.  Social  service  providers,  state  and  local 

agencies,  and  other  groups  with  direct  access  to  Tennessee’s  most  vulnerable  population 

generally are aware of their local legal aid office, but may not know of other state resources that 

provide  help  with  civil  legal  problems.  Further,  there  is  a  general  lack  of  knowledge  and 

understanding about civil legal aid and how helping someone who can’t afford a lawyer have a 

better experience in the legal system can positively impact the local community.  

Voices for Civil Justice (“Voices”) is a national communications initiative that uses the 

awareness-raising power of the media to spotlight the critical role of  civil legal aid in assuring 

fairness for all in the judicial system. It provides messaging guidance and other communication 

tools to advocates. Members of the Commission have been working with Voices staff since 2013 

to  help  increase  public  awareness  for  the  civil  legal  aid  community  in  Tennessee.  While  there 

have been many successful public awareness campaigns throughout Tennessee, Voices noted the 

lack of a coordinated communications plan encompassing all of the state and regional access to 

justice  stakeholders.  Due  to  the  recognized  strength  and  breadth  of  the  Tennessee  access  to 

justice  community,  Voices  has  agreed  to  assist  the  Commission  facilitate  a  statewide 

communications  plan  with  legal  aid  and  access  to  justice  programs.  Representatives  from  all 

stakeholders will be involved in this endeavor.

The  Commission  noted  during  its  planning  retreat  that  a  number  of  its  Advisory 

Committees had struggled  with  how  to publicize  new initiatives and achievements. During the 

discussion, the Commission determined that these committees should be  able to draw  from the 

public  relations  experts  on  the  Public  Awareness  Committee  to  assist  outreach  efforts.  The 

Public  Awareness  Committee  and  the  AOC  Staff  will  formalize  a  system  for  other  Advisory 

Committees  on  guidance  from  the  Public  Awareness  Committee  to  promote  new  programs,

Target Legal Needs of Low Income Tennesseans in Rural Areas.  One of the 

goals  in  the  2014  Strategic  Plan  which  will  carry  over  into  this  Plan  is  the  Commission’s 

objective of having at least one recurring pro bono legal advice clinic in each judicial district in 

Tennessee.  Currently,  there  are  clinics  in  26  of  the  31  judicial  districts.  Most  of  the  districts 

without clinics are located in the most rural and poorest sections of the state. The Commission 

will meet with members of the local bar associations, the judiciary, and other community leaders 

in each district to assist in developing a clinic model best suited to the needs of each community. 

The  Commission  will  also  explore  using  technology  to  infuse  additional  volunteers  into  these 

underserved areas with very little existing resources. Much time will also be devoted to maintain 

the standing civil legal advice clinics which the Commission has already assisted in developing. 

The Commission will develop best practices, update existing materials, and develop new training 

sessions for clinic providers.  

Goal:  

Continue and sustain clinic expansion project of having at least one 

recurring pro bono legal advice clinic in each judicial district.

The  TFJA  is  uniquely  aligned  to  learn  of  and  implement  new  programs  to  reach  low 

income  Tennesseans  in  rural  communities.  While  legal  resources  may  be  scarce  in  rural 

communities,  there  is  not  a  shortage  of  faith-based  institutions.  Oftentimes  the  faith-based 

institution  serves  as  one  of  the  main  places  where  people  go  to  socialize,  learn  about  new 

resources, and get help. The TFJA will steer its efforts and AOC staff towards rural parts of the 

state where there are no or very little pro bono opportunities. Similarly, the TFJA will work to  

 

23 
 

incorporate  faiths  other  than  Christianity  into  its  network  to  better  assist  all  low  income 

Tennesseans, regardless of their faith.

Utilize  Technology  to  Inform  and  Connect  the  Public  with  Resources. 

Multiple  Advisory  Committees  recommended  the  Commission  incorporate  technology  as  one 

means to connect the public with the necessary resources. An example of a successful initiative 

was launched in Marshall County in 2015 by Judge Lee Bussart, General Sessions Judge. Judge 

Bussart worked with the Marshall County Bar Association to introduce a “help button” system: a 

laptop with a database of answers to common legal questions in the court clerk’s office on May 

1, 2015, during Marshall County’s observance of Law Day. The laptop has court approved legal 

forms and directory of local lawyers with area of specialty. The laptop is in “kiosk mode” so that 

it can only be used for its intended purpose and not for things such as surfing the internet. TALS 

assisted  with  the  development  of  this  project.  The  Marshall  County  Bar  Association  was 

recognized by the American Bar Association for the “help button” system in providing the Most 

Innovative Law Day Program.   

This type initiative allows court clerks, who are not able to provide legal advice, to refer 

someone  with  questions  to  a  resource  can  be  accessed  immediately  to  provide  answers  and 

guidance on how to proceed in Court. It is a relatively inexpensive initiative. Other states have 

similar court kiosks in place in various courts. The Commission will examine the results from the 

24 
 

first year of the Marshall County “help button” and best practices from other states to add court 

kiosks to other courts in Tennessee. 

Goal:  

Create and implement plan to have 10 new court kiosks in different 

types of locations across the state.

Education Committee 

The  Commission  will  expand  its  collection  of  videos  for  self-represented  litigants

procedures.  The  Commission  will  examine  new  production  technology  to  enable  it  to  create 

videos quickly and facilitate editing in the future. Similarly, the Commission will add videos for 

volunteer lawyers on high needs areas of law to prepare them to help low income Tennesseans.   

Goal:  

Continue to create educational videos for volunteer lawyers and self-

represented litigants. 

Deadline:  

On-going with a minimum of three new videos per year.

Improve  Self-Represented  Litigants’  Experience  in  the  Court  System.  In 

2014, the Access to Justice Coordinator learned about an upcoming study being conducted by the 

Institute  for  the  Advancement  of  the  American  Legal  System  (IAALS)  at  the  University  of 

Denver.  This  study  focused on  the experience of  self-represented litigants in  family  law cases. 

With  the  Commission’s  approval,  the  ATJ  Coordinator  facilitated  use  of  Davidson  County 

Tennessee as one of four jurisdictions included in the study. The study was released in June 2016 

in  two  parts:  Cases  Without  Counsel:  Research  on  Experiences  of  Self-Representation  in  U.S. 

25 
 

Family  Court  and  Cases  Without  Counsel:  Our  Recommendations  After  Listening  to  the 

Litigants. The Cases Without Counsel reports indicate there is a very real justice gap within the 

United States; it builds upon numerous existing studies on the experience of the self-represented 

litigant.  The  Commission  will  use  the  findings  in  the  reports  and  other  studies  to  develop 

initiatives  designed  to  help  those  who  must  represent  themselves  because  they  cannot  afford  a 

lawyer.  Further,  the  Commission  will  examine  existing  rules  and  procedures  that  adversely 

impact self-represented litigants and make recommendations for modification.  

Goal: 

Create recommendations for changes in certain laws and procedures 

that adversely impact low income Tennesseans, specifically self-

represented litigants. 

Deadline: 

 

On-Going 

Responsibility:  

Self-Represented Litigants Committee; Commission 

The Commission determined that continued development of court forms written in plain 

language, a 5th to 8th grade reading level, is one of the necessary components of its strategy to 

help self-represented litigants. Having access to free court forms approved by the Supreme Court 

as  universally  acceptable  and  legally  sufficient  is  an  important  first  step  in  helping  self-

represented  litigants  understand  their  underlying  legal  issue  and  the  court  process.  The 

Commission  will create  additional  plain language forms for  use in  general  sessions  court, as it 

has  been  reported  by  general  sessions  judges  in  Tennessee  that  approximately  90%  of  the 

litigants in those courtrooms are not represented by a lawyer. The Commission will also develop 

forms on specific areas of law directed to issues low income Tennesseans frequently experience 

for use in other types of courts. The forms will include written instructions on how to complete 

them.  

26 
 

Once  the  Supreme  Court  approves  new  forms,  the  Commission  will  produce  videos  on 

how to complete the forms which will be made available on www.JusticeForAllTN.com and the 

AOC  website.  The  forms  will  be  made  available  in  multiple  formats,  including  a  fillable  PDF 

format so users can type in information. The Commission will also create samples of completed 

forms  for  self-represented  litigants  to  use  as  they  fill  them  out.  Lastly,  the  Commission  will 

monitor the automated forms project and encourage and support future automation of Supreme 

Court approved forms.  

Goal:  

Emphasize and expand plain language forms as one of the primary 

tools for self-represented litigants to understand the court system. 

Create guidance on how to complete forms. 

Deadline:  

 

One packet or group of forms per calendar year.  

Responsibility:  

Self-Represented Litigants Committee 

Much of the Commission’s success in developing resources for self-represented litigants 

is owed to members of the judiciary and court system. When the Commission formed the Self-

Represented Litigants Committee, it learned that there were many judges at all levels and court 

clerks who had identified the growing number of self-represented litigants and the need for more 

resources to serve them. Judge Dwight Stokes, General Sessions Judge in Sevier County, Judge 

Don  Ashe,  now  a  Senior  Judge,  and  Chancellor  Jimmy  Butler,  Judge  in  Madison  County  had 

already been active by having special dockets for self-represented litigants, creating and playing 

a  video  on  the  court  process,  that  self-represented  litigants  could  view  while  they  waited  for 

court  to  begin,  and  setting  up  a  website  with  court  forms  and  information.  The  Commission 

recognized  that  these  champions  were  making  great  strides  to  level  the  playing  field  for  self-

represented  litigants  and  has  partnered  with  each  on  many  projects.  The  Commission  will 

27 
 

educate  the  judiciary  and  court  staff  on  how  to  improve  the  experience  for  self-represented 

litigants  in  the  Tennessee  court  system  while  simultaneously  decreasing  the  strain  self-

represented litigants can have on court staff’s time and case management.  

Goal:  

Encourage and train judges to implement programs such as special 

dockets for self-represented litigants. Create special section of ATJ 

website for resources for judges. 

Deadline:  

On-going; Add one new resource to website quarterly.

Promote  and  Increase  Pro  Bono.  The  Commission  stated  as  a  2012  Strategic 

Plan  focus  to  provide  effective  pro  bono  representation  to  low  income  Tennesseans.  The 

Commission emphasizes its commitment to this objective. The 2012 Plan included a goal for at 

least  50%  of  Tennessee  attorneys  reporting,  an  average  of  50  hours  of  pro  bono  work  per 

reporting  attorney.  Since  the  Supreme  Court  implemented  voluntary  pro  bono  reporting,  the 

percentage of Tennessee attorneys has not risen yet to 50%. The highest percentage reported for 

pro bono work performed in 2011 and reported in 2012, when it reached 47.20%. The percentage 

has maintained above 40% for the past five years.  

The Commission will rely upon and enhance existing mechanisms to increase the amount 

of  pro  bono  work  being  provided  and  the  amount  of  pro  bono  work  being  reported.  It  will 

purposefully  promote  the  Attorneys  for  Justice  and  Law  Students  for  Justice  recognition 

programs through local bar associations, law schools, and legal aid providers. The Commission 

will propose to increase the number of public recognition events to include additional locations. 

The Commission understands that many lawyers are not aware of the many ways that pro bono 

28 
 

work  can  be  performed  pursuant  to  Supreme  Court  Rule  8,  Section  6.1.  Therefore  the 

Commission will educate lawyers on the types of work that qualify for recognition.   

Goal:  

Increase the number of lawyers being recognized as Attorneys for 

Justice by 10%.  

Deadline:  

 

December 2017. 

Responsibility:  

Pro Bono Committee. 

Since the Commission’s previous efforts to increase the number of law offices with pro 

bono  policies  was  a  success  and  there  were  a  handful  of  offices  that  were  in  the  process  of 

adopting the policy in 2014, the Commission will revisit that goal. Increasing the number of law 

firms with pro bono policies should create a new pool of volunteer lawyers.21  

Goal:  

Increase the number of law firms with pro bono policies by 10.  

Deadline:  

 

December 2017 

Responsibility:  

Pro Bono Committee. 

The Pillar Law Firm Model has been successful in helping law firms streamline pro bono 

work and create a sustainable partnership with the legal aid providers in their areas. Many of the 

firms report that their lawyers enjoy specializing in a particular legal issue. The lawyers are able 

to  overcome  concerns  about  helping  someone  in  a  field  of  law  in  which  they  do  not  routinely 

practice.  Recognition of the need for re-entry legal assistance, including getting public criminal 

records expunged, has risen over the past 12 months. The Commission will work with existing 

Pillar  Law  Firms  and  help  recruit  new  firms  to  address  this  need.  Expungement  and  other 

barriers to integration into the community should fit within the Pillar Law Firm Model because

they do not usually involve on-going representation and, while related to an underlying criminal 

matter,  are  procedural  in  nature.  For  example,  most  of  the  need  in  expungement  matters 

surrounds  accurately  completing  the  expungement  forms  and  filing  them  with  the  appropriate 

court.  The  AOC  has  created  an  Expungement  Workgroup  which  will  also  assist  in  developing 

expungement forms and resources.22 

Goal:  

Use existing resources, such as Pillar Law Firms, and create new ones 

to address growing need for re-entry legal services, including 

expungement resources and assistance. Have 3 Pillar Law Firms

Increase the Use of Pro Bono Mediation. The Mediation Advisory Committee 

developed  and  adopted  a  Mediator  of  the  Day  initiative  through  which  mediators  are  on  call 

during a special docket to mediate  cases when there is  at least one self-represented party. This 

model can and has been implemented through community mediation centers, by bar associations, 

or by a group of attorneys and/or Supreme Court Rule 31 Mediators.23 The Mediator of the Day 

program can modified to serve different types of locations (urban, suburban, rural) and different 

types of courts. It is a cost-effective method to help self-represented litigants achieve an outcome 

in a process where they are heard and decide the result.  

During  its  strategic  planning  retreat,  the  Commission  decided  its  Mediator  Advisory 

Committee would be folded into the Self-Represented Litigants Committee, as mediators are in a 

                                                 
22 The AOC has created a web page dedicated to expungement, https://www.tncourts.gov/expungements.

unique  position  to  understand  some  of  the  obstacles  faced  by  self-represented  litigants  in  the 

court system. The Commission believes that mediators’ expertise in dealing with self-represented 

litigants  will  inform  others  on  the  Self-Represented  Litigants  Committee  and  add  value  to  that 

Committee’s  projects.  The  volunteers  on  the  original  Mediation  Advisory  Committee  will 

continue to meet as a group to expand the Mediator of the Day program. The former Chair of the 

Mediation  Advisory  Committee  will  now  serve  as  Chair  of  the  Self-Represented  Litigants 

Committee to ensure that mediation will continue to be a primary focus.

Expand Mediator of the Day program to 10 new counties/types of 

court.

Committee  will  serve  as  a  liaison  to  a  newly-formed  ADR  Commission Pro  Bono  Committee.

be  used  to  resolve  issues  with  outstanding  medical  bills.  The  Committee  Chair  and  ATJ 

Coordinator met with VMC staff to begin planning the project. The Commission will recruit and 

train volunteer mediators to conduct mass mediations and assist in the logistical planning for the 

project.  The  Commission  will  compile  a  toolkit  and  best  practices  to  replicate  the  program  in 

other parts of the state.

Spotlight  and  Address  the  Need  for  Increased  Pro  Bono  and  Resources  for 

Family  Law.  Since  the  Commission  was  created,  there  has  been  a  huge  need  for  pro  bono 

lawyers  and  resources  for  low  income  Tennesseans  with  family  law  issues.  During  the 

Commission’s  first  years,  it  surveyed  court  clerks,  judges,  and  legal  aid  lawyers  seeking  their 

input on the most pressing legal needs for low income Tennesseans. Family law matters such as 

divorce, custody, child support, visitation, and similar matters were consistently on the list of the 

top  five  needs.  The  data  collected  by  www.tn.freelegalanswers.org  and  1-844-Help4TN  show 

that  family  law  matters  are  among  the  most  frequently  asked  questions.  The  IAALS  self-

represented  litigants  study  shows  how  disruptive  family  law  cases  are  for  self-represented 

litigants.  

32 
 

The  Commission  has  previously  set  family  law  as  one  of  its  priorities.  In  the  2014 

Strategic Plan, it set a goal of recruiting five new Pillar Law Firms to take family law cases and 

five existing Pillar Law Firms to handle family law cases in addition to the cases they currently 

take. Despite all  of its best  efforts,  the  Commission learned that the Pillar  Law  Firm  Model is 

most successful when legal matters  can be  more easily concluded than are family law  matters. 

Pillar Law Firms do handle some family law matters through limited scope representation such 

as child support or visitation issues but do not normally take on full representation of the entire 

case.  In  the  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Commission  created  on  online  curriculum  on  high  needs 

areas  of  the  law  which  included  videos  on  family  law  cases.  It  also  developed  plain  language 

resources for people with child support issues.  

While  there  has  been  some  success  with  these  family  law  initiatives,  the  Commission 

realizes that to truly make impact in the legal needs gap that exists for low income Tennesseans 

in family law matters, it must mobilize and determine how to recruit and train lawyers who will 

provide pro bono family law services to low income Tennesseans differently than how they are 

currently being provided. The Pro Bono Committee created a family law subcommittee in 2014 

to help with the goals in the 2014 Strategic Plan. That subcommittee will now become a stand-

alone Advisory Committee, separate from any of the Commission’s other Advisory Committee 

and  new  members  will  be  added.  This  marks  a  turning  point,  as  this  is  the  first  Advisory 

Committee devoted to substantive area of law.  

The  first  objective  for  this  new  Family  Law  Advisory  Committee  will  be  to  obtain  an 

understanding  of  the  existing  resources  and  programs  that  are  available  for  low  income 

Tennesseans and self-represented litigants with family law issues. The Committee will conduct 

targeted  outreach  to  the  judiciary,  court  staff,  the  private  bar,  legal  aid  lawyers,  social  service 

33 
 

providers,  faith  groups,  and  other  stakeholders  to  gather  a  full  picture  of  existing  family  law 

services.

VI.  Conclusion 

Dynamics  of  a  changing  legal  environment  can  be  challenging.  The  Commission 

appreciates that the Tennessee Supreme Court wisely directed it to accomplish improved access 

to  justice  by  providing  broad  guidance  to  address  four  major  focuses.  This  allows  the 

Commission  to  provide  meaningful  and  sustainable  initiatives  in  essential  areas  of  need 

continuously.  Since  its  inception,  the  Commission  has  recognized  it  must  be  sensitive  to 

challenges  and  opportunities  as  it  adopts  priorities  and  recommends  initiatives  in  response  to 

growing  needs.  This  2016  Strategic  Plan  outlines  the  Commission’s  priorities  for  the  next two 

years.  The  Commission  will  review  this  Plan  quarterly  to  gauge  its  viability  and  measure  its 

successes. The Commission looks forward to working under the continued positive leadership of 

the Tennessee Supreme Court, advancing Tennessee as one of the access to justice leaders in the 

United States. Further, the Commission looks for opportunities to collaborate with its access to 

justice allies to better serve Tennessee’s vulnerable population.

2.01. The  Commission  shall  develop  a  strategic  plan  for  improving  access  to  justice  in 
Tennessee that shall include education of the public concerning the need for legal representation 
to meet the  ideal of  equal  justice  under law, identification of the priorities to  meet the  need of 
improved access to justice, and recommendations to the Supreme Court of projects and programs 
the  Commission  determines  to  be  necessary  and  appropriate  for  enhancing  access  to  justice  in 

Tennessee. The Commission shall submit a strategic plan to the Court within twelve months of

programs, judges, and court clerks across the state to promote and to recognize pro bono 
service by lawyers across the state;

provide pro bono and reduced-rate mediation services to self-represented litigants and to 
litigants who, although represented, have modest means or who are pro bono clients; 

(e) Address existing and proposed laws, rules, procedures, and polices that are barriers to 
access  to  justice  for  low  income  Tennesseans  and  to  consider  the  role  of  community 
education and increased availability of technology in reducing these barriers. 

(f) Develop and recommend initiatives and systemic changes to reduce barriers to access 
to justice and to meet the legal needs of: 

 

 

(1) Persons who do not qualify for existing assistance programs by reason of their 
incomes but whose access to civil justice is limited by the actual or perceived cost 
of legal services; 

(2) Persons with disabilities who do not qualify for existing assistance programs 
by reason of their incomes; 

(3) Persons in language minorities; and 

(4)  Persons  whose  legal  needs  may  not  be  met  due  to  restrictions  on 
representation by legal aid programs funded by the Legal Services Corporation.

barriers faced by many Tennesseans in gaining effective access to the civil justice system; and 
 

(h)  Study  and  recommend  strategies  to  increase  resources  and  funding  for  access  to 

2.05. The  Commission  has  no

Supreme Court 
Rule 52 

Rule 52.  Forms Approved for Use in Tennessee Courts. 

Section 1.01. Purpose.  The Tennessee judicial system should be accessible to all 
litigants including those unable to pay for the assistance of counsel. As one means of increasing 
access to the Tennessee judicial system, the Court is providing greater resources for self-
represented litigants, lawyers, and court personnel by approving forms that shall be universally 
acceptable as legally sufficient in all Tennessee courts. It is not the intent of this rule to mandate 
the use of court-approved forms; rather, the intent is to ensure that court-approved forms are 
accepted for filing by all Tennessee courts when litigants or attorneys choose to use them. 

ection 1.02. Definitions.   

a) “Court-approved forms” means any and all forms adopted by the Tennessee Supreme 
Court pursuant to this rule. 

b) “Universally acceptable as legally sufficient” means that Tennessee courts must 
accept for filing any court-approved forms submitted by a litigant or litigant's attorney, 
subject to the limitation stated in section 1.04. 

ection 1.03. Use of Court-Approved Forms.  Any form approved by the Supreme 

Court pursuant to this rule shall be deemed universally acceptable as legally sufficient for filing 
in the Tennessee courts. The foregoing sentence, however, does not limit the court’s authority to 
adjudicate the legal efficacy of the contents of the filing under the applicable rules of procedure 
and any other pertinent law. Litigants and attorneys are encouraged to use court-approved forms; 
however, the use of court-approved forms is not mandatory. 

ection 1.04. Alteration of Court-Approved Forms.  If a court-approved form is 

altered beyond mere completion of the form, the altered form shall no longer be considered a 
court-approved form or universally acceptable as legally sufficient as those terms are used in this 
rule. If a court-approved form is altered beyond mere completion of the form, the words 
“Approved by the Tennessee Supreme Court” shall be removed from the altered form. 

ection 1.05. Updating Court-Approved Forms.  The Administrative Office of the 
Courts shall be responsible for maintaining and updating court-approved forms. Additionally, 
court-approved forms shall be posted on the website of the Tennessee State Courts as “Tenn. 
Sup. Ct. R. 52 Court-Approved Forms”.

I.  Introduction 

In August 2008, the Tennessee Supreme Court declared Access to Justice its number one 

strategic priority, and, later that year, launched its Access to Justice campaign.  On April 3, 2009, 

the Court created the Tennessee Access to Justice Commission and charged it with developing its 

first  strategic  plan  within  a  year  and  updating  the  plan  every  two  years  thereafter.      The  2012 

Plan  details  the  progress  in  implementing  the  goals  of  the  Commission’s  initial  2010  Strategic 

Plan.   The 2012 Plan also addresses new objectives and benchmarks to address the civil legal 

needs crisis.   

The 2010 Plan outlined how the Supreme Court began its Access to Justice Initiative and 

the Court’s impressive efforts to carry out this initiative.  During the past two years, the Court’s 

commitment has never waivered and indeed, has intensified.  The Court—as individual justices 

and as a whole—participates in access to justice events and meetings of the Commission and its 

Advisory  Committee, makes  prompt  decisions  to  promote  the  initiative  and  speaks  locally  and 

nationally  on  this  topic.    The  leadership  and  visibility  of  the  Court  has  not  only  inspired  the 

Commission, but also inspired and galvanized the broader access to justice community, the bar 

and its associations, the judiciary and the court system as a whole. 

The 2010 Plan set forth four overarching goals and identified strategic ways for the Court 

and Commission to accomplish these goals.  This 2012 Plan updates the 2010 Plan by identifying 

the initiatives and accomplishments of the Supreme Court and the Commission during the past 

two  years.      These  accomplishments  reflect  the  dedication  and  support  of  a  broad  network  of 

lawyers, law firms, corporate legal departments, bar associations, legal service programs, judges, 

clerks,  law  schools,  librarians,  service  providers,  nonprofits,  faith–based  organizations  and 

businesses to accomplish these goals.    

1 

   

   

 

The 2012 Plan also sets forth additional goals and initiatives that will aid and expedite 

the Supreme Court’s dynamic and ongoing Access to Justice Campaign.   In particular, the 2012 

Plan focuses on the Commission’s first goal, which is to involve more lawyers and law students 

in meeting legal needs so that the public is better served.  Key to the implementation of this goal 

is  supporting  the  development  of  a  more  comprehensive  pro  bono  delivery  system  across  the 

state.      The  2012  Plan  also  addresses  the  necessity  of  further  outreach  and  public  awareness 

regarding  access  to  justice  resources  to  self-represented  individuals  and  to  the  community  at 

II.   Accomplishments and Highlights of the 2010 Plan.  

t  each  quarterly  meeting,  the  Commission  reviewed  the  2010  Plan  (Appendix  I)  and 

received an update regarding how the Commission was proceeding towards accomplishing these 

goals.    The  most  recent  2010  Strategic  Plan  Quarterly  Update  is  attached  to  this  Plan  in 

Appendix E.   As set forth in the update, the Commission met most of its goals and considered 

which goals were unmet and needed to be pursued for the 2012 Plan.   Some of the highlights of 

  A

large.   

the accomplishments of the 2010 Plan are: 

          A.      Pro Bono Summit.  The Supreme Court and the Commission sponsored a Pro Bono  

Summit in Nashville on January 21, 2011.  All five members of the Court addressed the Summit 

and  attended  the  day-long  conference.    Bar  association  officers,  law  firm  managing  partners, 

rural practitioners, corporate counsel, deans of Tennessee law schools, law students, legal service 

providers, representatives from the state libraries, and other service providers also attended the 

Summit, which focused on increasing pro bono service performed by Tennessee attorneys.   

The  Summit  offered  a  variety  of  panel  discussions  including  guidance  on  developing  a 

pro bono clinic, how to increase attorney pro bono at large law firms and corporations, specific 

2 

   

issues  that  arise  in  rural  areas,  best  practices  for  involving  law  students  in  pro  bono  work  and 

ways  that  technology  helps  attorneys  reach  more  indigent  Tennesseans.    All  sessions  were 

recorded  and  made  available  online.    Participants  completed  pledge  cards  stating  how  they 

planned  to  increase  pro  bono  in  their  practice,  and  the  ATJ  Coordinator  followed  up  with 

participants to assist in carrying out these pledges.  New ideas and partnerships were formed as a 

result  of  the  Summit,  including  coordination  among  law  school  pro  bono  programs,  ideas  for 

uses  of  technology  in  the  rural  communities  and  introduction  of  the  ATJ  website, 

OnlineTNJustice.org and the Appellate Pro Bono Project.    

B.      Access  to  Justice  Website.      In  November  2011,  the  Supreme  Court  launched 

www.JusticeForAllTN.com.    The  user-friendly  website  has  an  innovative  and  effective  dual 

purpose of providing information both to the public and the bar.  Viewers who click “legal help” 

can find information on how to find a lawyer, a glossary of common legal terms, links to court 

forms  and  plain  language  information  on  a  variety  of  legal  issues,  including  divorce,  child 

support, housing information, healthcare, immigration, and mediation.  One of the most popular 

tools  on  the  site  is  an  interactive  map  of  Tennessee’s  95  counties  where  users  are  directed  to 

county-specific  contact 

information  for 

legal  aid  providers,  social  service  providers, 

governmental agencies and the court system.  For lawyers and other website visitors who click “I 

can help,” the site provides information ranging from how to volunteer with a legal aid provider 

or a bar association to a step-by-step guide for how to develop a pro bono clinic.  (Appendix H).  

C.      Supreme Court Rules.  A key component of the 2010 Plan was working with the 

Supreme  Court  to  adopt  rule  changes  that  eliminate  barriers  to  pro  bono  service  and  pro  se 

representation.  The Court, the Access to Justice Commission, and many strategic partners have 

made great strides in this area.  The Supreme Court has: 

3 

   

•  Adopted Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 50A to establish an emeritus attorney licensure 
status allowing attorneys with inactive licenses to provide pro bono legal services through 
an  established  not-for-profit  bar  association,  pro  bono  program,  or  legal  services 
program; 
 

•  Adopted  Tennessee  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  72  to  permit  unsworn  declarations  made 
under  penalty  of  perjury  to  be  filed  in  lieu  of  an  affidavit  or  sworn  declaration, 
eliminating unnecessary barriers for persons of limited means to court system;  

•  Amended  Tennessee  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  11(b)(1)  to  require  judges  to  inform 
criminal  defendants  in  the  plea  colloquy  that  a  guilty  plea  may  have  immigration 
consequences;  

•  Adopted Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 52 to provide a process for and approve forms 

that are universally acceptable as legally sufficient in all Tennessee courts;  

•  Revised Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 9, Section 20.11 to streamline the voluntary pro 
bono  reporting  statement  included  in  the  annual  Tennessee  Board  of  Professional 
Responsibility attorney licensure renewal statement;  

•  Revised  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  Rule  41  to  request  court  interpreters  to  aspire  to 

provide pro bono interpretive services each year;  

•  Revised  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  Rule  42  to  provide  that  if  the  court  determines  a 
participant  has  a  limited  ability  to  understand  and  communicate  in  English,  the  court 
should appoint an interpreter, write a summary of the court’s efforts to obtain a certified 
or registered interpreter and determine the capabilities of the proposed non-credentialed 
interpreter in open court;  
 

•  Amended Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 5.02 to provide instruction on how to serve 
notice  when  an  attorney  is  providing  limited  scope  representation  to  an  otherwise  self-
represented party; and  

•  Amended Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 11.01 to provide the procedures by which 
attorneys  providing  limited  scope  representation  to  an  otherwise  self-represented  party 
shall notify the court of the limited scope representation and how attorneys may withdraw 
from the matter once the limited scope representation is complete.  

   D.        Plain  Language  Forms.    Pursuant  to  the  adoption  of  Supreme  Court  Rule  52,  the 

Court  has  approved  plain  language  forms  drafted  at  a  fifth  to  eighth  grade  reading  level  to  be 

used  by  those  seeking  uncontested  divorces  that  do  not  involve  minor  children  or  significant 

marital  assets.  Also  provided  is  a  packet  of  instructions  on  how  to  complete  and  file  the 

4 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

uncontested divorce forms with the court.  The forms went into effect on September 1, 2011, and 

have  been  positively  received  by  the  public,  the  judiciary,  and  attorneys.    Spurred  on  by  the 

Commission,  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts  (“AOC”)  converted  its  existing  Order  of 

Protection  forms  into  plain  language  and  translated  these  forms  into  Spanish.    The  Supreme 

Court  has  also  developed  a  second  packet  of  plain  language  forms  commonly  used  in  General 

Sessions Court.  Those forms have been submitted for public comment.  

E.        Commission  Advisory  Committees.      The  Commission  formed  seven  Advisory 

Committees to carry out its goals, each headed by one or more Commissioners.  These Advisory 

ach advisory committee was charged with work toward achieving the four over-arching goals 

outlined  in  the  2010  Strategic  Plan.  The  Chairs  provided  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the 

Commission. 

  Each  committee  made  substantive  contributions 

toward  achieving 

the 

Commission’s goals.   

1. 

Disability  and  Language  Barriers.    The  Disability  and  Language  Barriers 

Advisory Committee recommended that the AOC form an Interpreter Work Group.   This group 

examines Supreme Court Rules to identify ways to incorporate technology, such as remote court 

interpreting, in order to better serve Tennesseans with limited English proficiency.  Based upon 

the  recommendation  of  this  Advisory  Committee  and  the  Interpreter  Work  Group,  the 

Commission  recommended  changes  to  Rules  41  and  42,  which  were  adopted  by  the  Supreme 

5 

  E

   

Committees were:   

o  Disability and Language Barriers 
o  Education/Public Awareness 
o  Faith-Based Initiatives 
o  Pro Bono 
o  Pro Se/Forms 
o  Resources 
o  Technology. 

Court.    The  Committee  and  the  Commission  also  continue  to  encourage  and  monitor  the 

translation  of  forms  and  ATJ  website  information  into  Spanish  and  other  languages.    The 

Advisory  Committee  assisted  the  AOC  in  developing  the  content  regarding  interpreters, 

immigration, and assistance for Tennesseans with disabilities for the ATJ website.   

 

2.     Education/Public Awareness.   One of the most significant accomplishments of the 

Education/Public Awareness Advisory Committee is its development of the “Pro Bono Clinic in 

a Box” forms, prominently featured at both the Pro Bono Summit and the ATJ website.  These 

forms allow a bar association or informal group of attorneys to create a pro bono advice clinic 

complete  with  informational  handouts  for  volunteers  and  clients,  intake  sheets,  and  marketing 

and  public  relations  information.    The  Advisory  Committee  also  recommended  changes  to 

Supreme Court Rule 31 which would educate mediators on pro bono mediation opportunities and 

promote  pro  bono  and  reduced  fee  mediation  services  to  judges  and  court  clerks.    The 

Commission has approved these recommendations and forwarded them to the Supreme Court’s 

Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission for consideration.   

3.      Faith-Based  Initiatives.    The  Commission  established  the  Faith-Based  Initiatives 

Committee  in  recognition  that  the  faith-based  community  is  an  untapped  point  of  access  for 

people  who  need  help  and  a  valuable  resource  for  attorneys  and  legal  professionals  who  are 

active in their faith-based organizations.  The Committee began its outreach with the Tennessee 

and  Memphis  Conferences  of  the  United  Methodist  Church,  which  already  have  established 

social justice programs.  The Commission Chair, the Chief Justice, and Committee members are 

working with the District Superintendents of these Conferences to incorporate pro bono lawyers 

into  congregational  care,  legal  clinics  and  the  church’s  social  justice  programs.    The  District 

6 

   

Superintendents have approved the plan attached in Appendix J, and the Committee hopes that 

this partnership can be used as a model to reach out to other faith-based communities.   

4.     Pro Bono.  The Pro Bono Advisory Committee was instrumental in planning and 

participating  in  the  Pro  Bono  Summit.    Through  the  work  of  this  Committee,  the  Commission 

eliminated the lack of malpractice insurance for attorneys doing pro bono through organizations 

that do not receive federal funds from the Legal Services Corporation.  The Committee was also 

the  catalyst  for  many  of  the  Commission’s  recommended  Supreme  Court  Rule  changes  to 

promote  and  encourage  more  pro  bono  work,  including  the  rules  regarding  limited  scope 

representation and the streamlined voluntary pro bono reporting form. The Committee actively 

encouraged  and  promoted  OnlineTNJustice.org  and  the  Appellate  Pro  Bono  Project  and  asked 

the Court to encourage more pro bono reporting by including a letter from the Chief Justice in 

the annual attorney renewal packet.  The Committee further addressed ways in which the Court 

encouraged attorneys employed in the judicial branch to participate in pro bono work.  

 

5.        Pro  Se/Forms.    The  Pro  Se  Representation/Forms  Committee  took  a  pro-active 

approach  to  the  direct  provision  of  legal  and  educational  resources.    The  Committee 

recommended  a  process  for  approval  by  the  Commission  and  the  Supreme  Court  for  the 

development of plain language forms which are legally sufficient for acceptance in all Tennessee 

courts.      Additionally,  the  members  of  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Commission  and  Advisory 

Committee members have participated in many educational programs for judges and court clerks 

on  the  newly-developed  forms  and  guidelines.    The  first  approved  form,  which  concerns 

“simple”  uncontested  divorces,  was  the  product  of  a  long,  thoughtful  process  attempting  to 

balance  the  need  for  legal  representation  with  the  reality  that  not  every  person  can  (or  will) 

engage an attorney to give advice on an activity that has such important legal ramifications.   The 

7 

   

Committee is presently developing plain language forms for use in General Sessions Court.  In 

addition  to  the  creation  of  forms,  the  Committee  recommended  guidance  for  court  staff  and 

judges who encounter self-represented parties.  The result has been tools such as “Guidelines for 

Tennessee  Clerks  Who  Assist  Self-Represented  Litigants”  and  a  Bench  Book  for  General 

Sessions Judges presiding over proceedings with self-represented litigants.  The Bench Book was 

presented to the General Sessions Judges Conference in February 2012.    

 

6.            Resources.    The  Resource Advisory  Committee  focused  on  increasing  access  to 

justice by increasing resources.  Mindful of increasingly restricted funding sources, however, the 

Committee’s  approach  was  a  deliberate  attempt  at  maximizing  existing  monetary  and 

nonmonetary  resources.  The  Commission  has  also  approved  the  Committee’s  proposal  to 

strengthen  its  relationship  with  the  state  libraries  through  its  partnership  with  the  Tennessee 

Alliance for Legal Services (“TALS”) and to create a new partnership with the Tennessee Board 

of  Regents  to  use  its  Technology  Centers  across  the  state  as  self-help  centers.    As  part  of  the 

Commission’s  overall  approval  of  the  Committee’s  recommendations  for  the  2012  Plan,  the 

Commission  approved  working  with  existing  funding  providers,  such  as  the  Tennessee  Bar 

Foundation,  to  emphasize  components  of  the  2012  plan  in  the  factors  for  selecting  grant 

recipients.  (Appendix  L).  Based  on  the  Committee’s  recommendation,  the  Commission  has 

approved further study of the current IOLTA and Cy Pres Rules to determine how to maximize 

funding for pro bono and legal aid services.   

 

7.     Technology.  The Technology Advisory Committee unveiled OnlineTNJustice.org 

and  presented  the  Court’s  access  to  justice  website,  JusticeForAllTN.com  at  the  Pro  Bono 

Summit.    In  response  to  the  identified  need  for  outreach  specific  to  Tennessee’s  rural 

communities,  the  Committee  worked  on  using  technological  advances  to  connect  rural 

8 

   

Tennesseans  with  attorneys  in  suburban  and  urban  areas.    Two  pilot  projects  grew  from  this 

endeavor.  The first provides automating forms frequently used by attorneys providing pro bono 

services through a legal services provider.  The second pilot project created an online screening 

system for Tennesseans applying for pro bono help from the Legal Aid Society.  The screening 

system facilitates an initial eligibility determination by sending the potential client’s application 

to the local legal aid office.  Legal Aid then connects eligible clients with a pro bono attorney.  

This project is particularly helpful in areas where potential clients would otherwise be forced to 

travel long distances to reach a Legal Aid Office, as many offices serve multiple rural counties.  

The Committee also analyzed the Washington State Access to Justice Technology Principles and 

recommended  a  modified  version  of  these  Technology  Principles,  which  the  Commission 

approved as part of its 2012 Plan.  (Appendix K).  Each Advisory Committee should adhere to 

the Technology Principles when developing new initiatives and pilot projects.   

III.   Summary of Recommendations of the 2012 Plan. 

The first goal in the Commission’s 2010 Plan was to better serve the public by involving 

more lawyers and law students in meeting legal needs.  The Commission, working in conjunction 

with the  Court, made  significant  strides.    Revisions  to Supreme Court  Rules—particularly the 

limited scope representation rule—helped eliminate barriers to pro bono work.  Additionally, the 

pledges of increased participation stemming from the Pro Bono Summit helped large law firms, 

corporate law firms, and solo practitioners “plug in” to pro bono service.  The development of 

the  Pro  Bono  Clinic  in  a  Box  and  the  innovative  use  of  technology  have  created  new  ways  to 

connect  lawyers  with  clients.    The  Commission  recognizes,  however,  that  there  is  still  much 

work to do. 

9 

 

 

   

 

In  drafting  the  2012  Plan,  the  Commission  took  a  hard  look  at  what  needs  to  be 

accomplished to increase the access of Tennesseans to quality representation.  The Commission 

recognizes  that  maintaining  the  status  quo  is  not  an  option.  While  increasing  the  educational 

resources  available  to  self-represented  persons  undoubtedly  provides  a  useful  and  necessary 

service,  the  Commission’s  findings  have  underscored  the  importance  of  quality  legal 

representation.    Thus,  providing  quality  representation  to  indigent  Tennesseans  and  creating 

better  ways  to  connect  clients  with  lawyers  is  the  primary  objective  of  the  2012  Plan.  The 

Commission  set  a  goal  that  50%  of  attorneys  residing  in  Tennessee  will  provide  pro  bono 

services  as  defined  by  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  at  an  average  of  50  hours  per  year  on  or 

before January 1, 2015.  

 

Three  years into the Access  to Justice Campaign, Tennessee  is becoming  a  model state 

for  the  delivery  of  pro  bono  legal  services.    The  support  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  the 

established  access  to  justice  partnerships  provide  a  solid  foundation.    Moving  forward,  the 

Commission will continue developing strategies to provide quality representation and access to 

justice and will launch new initiatives to support those strategies.  Attorney education, attorney 

recruitment, client education, removal of barriers and lawyer-client connections will continue to 

be areas of special attention.   However, it is equally important to develop systems to measure 

the impact of our programs and adjust goals accordingly.   

As an initial step toward measuring the need for pro bono and the resources available, the 

Commission  asked  Access  to  Justice  Coordinator  Anne-Louise  Wirthlin  to  compile  a 

comprehensive report of all the pro bono activities in Tennessee.  The result is “The Pro Bono 

Report.” (Appendix G). Using the Pro Bono Report to establish a baseline for measurement in 

10 

   

the 2012 Plan, the Commission will annually update the report to help measure the success of its 

strategies and initiatives.     

Alongside the primary goal of expanding pro bono services, the Commission continues to 

address the needs of self-represented persons.  There is also continued need for the Commission 

to  focus  on  removal  of  barriers.      The  Commission  will  continue  assisting  self-represented 

persons by recommending more plain language forms to the Supreme Court, producing a series 

of educational videos with legal information and developing additional training for the bench and 

bar.  Most importantly, the Commission recognizes that it needs to do a better job of educating 

and  enhancing  public  awareness,  including  lawyers’  awareness,  about  the  resources  and 

opportunities available for self-represented persons and pro bono services.  

IV.    Goals 

A. 

Goal 1:  Fifty percent (50%) of attorneys residing in Tennessee will provide 

pro  bono  services  as  defined  by  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  at  an  average  of  fifty  (50) 

hours per year on or before January 1, 2015.  

1. The Pro Bono Report (Appendix G).  In May 2011, ATJ Coordinator Anne-Louise 

Wirthlin  attended  the  Equal  Justice  Conference  presented  by  the  American  Bar  Association 

Standing Committee on Pro Bono and Public Service and the National Legal Aid and Defender 

Association.    A  common  theme  among  the  participants  was  that  there  was  no  comprehensive 

knowledge of the pro bono activities in each individual state.  ATJ groups are generally aware of 

pro bono efforts, but there is no centrally located information.  As a result, there are innovative 

and  effective  efforts  being  applied  across  the  country,  but,  without  centralized  data  and 

communications,  this  lack  of  knowledge  inhibits  planning  and  coordination.    The  Commission 

11 

   

asked the ATJ Coordinator to compile a comprehensive report on the pro bono services within 

the state of Tennessee.   

The Pro Bono Report thus provides baseline information to help the Commission better 

understand  the  conditions  affecting  access  to  justice  in  Tennessee  and  determine  whether  the 

Commission’s  strategies  and  efforts  are  successful.    The  Pro  Bono  Report  provides  a  highly 

detailed  and  invaluable  snapshot  of  the  current  state  of  pro  bono  in  Tennessee.    The  report 

addresses  the  Commission’s  activities  thus  far  and  provides  insight  into  areas  that  provide  the 

most  potential  for  successful  access  to  justice  initiatives  by  addressing  (1)  bar  association  pro 

bono;  (2)  law  school  pro  bono;  (3)  pro  bono  from  Legal  Aid  providers  (4)  attorney  pro  bono 

volunteer  reporting  statistics  (5)  2011  pro  bono  month,  (6)  statistical  summaries  of 

www.OnlineTNjustice.org, and (7) pro bono CLE hours.   

The  Supreme  Court  defines  “pro  bono  services”  as  services  provided  without  a  fee  or 

expectation of a fee to persons of limited means or organizations that primarily address the needs 

of persons of limited means.  Tenn. S. Ct. R. 8, RPC 6.1 (a)(1)-(2).  Pro bono service can also be 

the delivery of legal services at a substantially reduced fee to persons of limited means.  Tenn. S. 

Ct. R. 8, RPC 6.1 (b)(2).  Attorneys can also do pro bono through the provision of legal services 

at  no  fee  or  at  a  substantially  reduced  fee  to  individuals,  groups,  or  organizations  seeking  to 

secure  or  protect  civil  rights  and  liberties,  or  charitable,  religious,  civic,  community, 

governmental  and  educational  organizations  in  matters  in  furtherance  of  their  organizational 

purposes  where  payment  of  standard  legal  fees  would  deplete  the  organization’s  resources  or 

would  be  inappropriate.      Tenn.  S.  Ct.  R.  8,  RPC  6.1  (b)(1).    Participation  in  activities  for 

improving  the  law,  the  legal  system,  or  the  legal  profession  is  also  deemed  pro  bono  legal 

services by the Court.  Tenn. S. Ct. R. 8, RPC 6.1 (b)(3).    

12 

   

The Pro Bono Report revealed that in 2009, 18.26% of attorneys licensed in Tennessee 

voluntarily  reported  pro  bono  service  with  their  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility  Annual 

Registration Packet.  That year, the average attorney reporting pro bono service donated seventy-

nine hours per  year.  For 2010,  38.96%  of all licensed attorneys voluntarily reported  pro bono 

service  averaging  seventy-three  hours  per  year.      The  2010  data  was  broken  down  further  to 

examine the reporting activity of attorneys residing in Tennessee and attorneys licensed but not 

residing  in  Tennessee.      The  data  revealed  that  6,598  of  the  estimated  16,391  attorneys  with 

active licenses residing in Tennessee reported their pro bono service.  Thus, in 2010, 40.25% of 

active  licensed  attorneys  residing  in  Tennessee  voluntarily  reported  pro  bono  service  at  an 

average of seventy-four hours per year, which exceeds the aspirational goal of 50 hours per year 

set forth in Tenn. S. Ct. R. 8, RPC 6.1.  With this information in hand, the Commission set the 

goal that 50% of attorneys residing in Tennessee will provide pro bono services as defined by the 

Court on an average of 50 hours per year on or before January 1, 2015.   

2.    Attorney Education.  Although legal advice clinics are an important aspect of pro 

bono, the Commission wants to emphasize the importance of a lawyer taking up representation 

of the individual, even if the representation is limited in scope.  Practitioners quickly learn that 

law school does not necessarily provide adequate preparation to immediately handle many of the 

areas  of  the  law  that  most  often  affect  indigent  Tennesseans.    These  areas  include  family  law, 

consumer/credit issues, landlord/tenant, and benefits.  It is vital and necessary to provide lawyers 

with the necessary skills to handle these “High Need” substantive areas of the law, particularly in 

specific  venues,  e.g.,  general  sessions,  juvenile,  family  law  and  bankruptcy  courts.    Moving 

forward, a particular emphasis of the Commission will be to focus on preparing pro bono lawyers 

to take on the direct representation of an individual, if an initial consultation does not resolve the 

13 

   

1.  Develop an online curriculum on High Need areas of the law, beginning with family 
law  and  debtor/creditor  issues  to  be  available  on  or  before  November  1,  2012. 
Complete  the  curriculum  by  August  1,  2013.    The  Commission  will  seek  to 
collaborate  with  the  Tennessee  Bar  Association  and  other  bar  associations,  legal 
service  providers,  the  Tennessee  Alliance  for  Legal  Services  and  the  groups  listed 
below to accomplish this goal.   

.        Law  Schools:  Assist  in  curriculum  development  and  use  the  curriculum  as 

template for symposia for law students. 

b.       The  Judiciary:  Use  judges  as  teachers  and  instructors  for  the  courses  to 

increase participation and demonstrate judicial support. 

c.        Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts:  Develop  webcast(s)  on  pro  bono 
opportunities  available  to  lawyers  and  promote  www.JusticeForAll.com  as  a 
method  to  disseminate  information  to  lawyers.    Ask  the  Court  and  other 
judges to participate in the webcasts. 

  a

 

2.  Establish a marketing and public relations campaign to communicate strategies and 

CLE opportunities to lawyers to launch on or before October 1, 2012. 

a.        Inform  lawyers  that  they  may  obtain  Ethics  and  Professionalism  CLE  credit 

for their pro bono work. 

b.       Promote  the  access  to  justice  website,  www.JusticeForAllTN.com,  as  a 
method  for  lawyers  to  find  out  what  pro  bono  opportunities  and  resources 
exist inside and outside their area.   
 

3.  Promote to other cities the partnership model established by Nashville law firms, the 
“Pillar Firm” model, whereby firms with strong commitments educate their attorneys 
on substantive areas of the law and take more pro bono cases in those areas. 
 

4.  By October 1, 2012, propose to the Court/CLE Commission that excess CLE funds 
be    designated  by  the  CLE  Commission  and  the  Supreme  Court  to  provide  for  the 
High  Needs  pro  bono  CLE  training,  the  promotion  thereof,  and  other  access  to 
justice initiatives.  

5.  Measure and track the results of this initiative by tracking attendance and following 
up  with  attorneys  who  participated  in  the  curriculum  to  determine  if  they 
subsequently took a pro bono case.  

legal  issue.  Direct  representation  can  entail  handling  the  entire  case  or  providing  “unbundled” 

legal services per an agreement with the individual.   

The Commission will: 

14 

 

 

     

   

o  increase  participation  so  that  50%  of  lawyers  residing  in  Tennessee  provide  an 

3.  Attorney Recruitment 

  T

average  of  50  hours  of  pro  bono  per  year,  the  Commission  must  add  to  the  existing  pool  of 

attorneys engaged in pro bono.  Multiple initiatives should be utilized to recruit more lawyers.  

The  Commission  understands  that  there  is  a  wide  spectrum  of  law  practices  in  Tennessee, 

ranging from solo practitioners to large law firms, and that lawyers practice in urban, suburban, 

and rural communities and that not every strategy is appropriate for every community.  

To recruit more lawyers providing pro bono, the Commission will: 

1.  Promote  www.JusticeForAllTN.com  and  www.onlineTNjustice.org  to  increase 

awareness of alternative ways to participate. 

2.  By December 1, 2012, provide attorneys in parts of the state with no organized pro 
bono program with resources such as Attorney of the Day materials to organize pro 
bono efforts tailored to their community. 

3. 

Identify firms that do not have pro bono policies and request that those firms adopt a 
pro bono policy so that 10 additional firms adopt pro bono plans by January 1, 2013, 
and 5 additional forms adopt pro bono plans by June 1, 2013.   
 

4.  Combine efforts with the  TBA to recruit law firms in other communities  to follow 
the partnership model established by Nashville law firms, the “Pillar Firm” model so 
that the Model is adopted in at least two communities on or before January 1, 2013. 

5.  Convene an in person or telephone conference of law school deans, law school pro 
bono  directors,  and  students  together  at  least  annually  to  create  ways  to  partner  to 
increase  pro  bono  participation.    Develop  an  exemplar  law  school  bono  policy  for 
Tennessee law schools by December 1, 2012. 

6.  Develop a proposal for recognition by the Court of firms or legal departments with 
pro bono policies, individual attorneys, and pro bono organizations with exemplary 
pro  bono  participation.    Present  the  proposal  to  the  Court  on  or  before  August  1, 
2012. 

7.  Update the Pro Bono Report annually by January 31 each year to capture pro bono 

work statewide and to measure success.

4.  Client Education and Removal of Barriers 

      Providing  Tennesseans  with  an  understanding  of  how  to  access  a  lawyer  is  integral  to 

delivering access to justice. This requires a  public awareness effort to reach Tennesseans in need 

through partnerships with places the public commonly goes to seek help, such as libraries, faith-

based organizations, courthouses and social service providers.  In conjunction with educating the 

public,  the  Commission  will  continue  its  work  to  remove  common  barriers  encountered  in  the 

search  for  a  pro  bono  lawyer.    Many  of  these  objectives  compliment  the  Commission’s  goals 

regarding public awareness for self-represented persons discussed in more detail in Section B.   

To educate the public on the availability of pro bono services and to remove barriers to 

finding a pro bono lawyer, the Commission will: 

1.  Promote  the  available  existing  technology  such  as  Online  Tennessee  Justice, 
Tennessee Technology Centers, www.JusticeForAllTN.com as ways to access a pro 
bono lawyer. 

2.  Provide  information  and  resources  to  intake  staff  at  legal  service  organizations 
through  TALS,  general  sessions  courts,  and  court  clerks  offices  so  that  they  can 
direct the public to pro bono lawyers.   The AOC will supply information to judicial 
staff and to state and federal elected officials. 

3.  Explore the creation of an Access to Justice application for smart phones and tablet 
computers  to  provide  clients  with  easily  accessible  information  on  pro  bono 
resources in their community.  Make a recommendation to the Court by November 1, 
2012.   

4.  Make  www.JusticeForAllTN.com  available  in  languages  other  than  English, 

beginning with Spanish by September 1, 2012 

5.  By  September  1, 2012, develop guidance and instructions on the use of interactive 
technology such as Skype to connect clients in rural areas with pro bono lawyers in 
other parts of the state. 

16 

 

 

 

 

 

           

   

    

Connecting Lawyers With Clients 

  5. 
 

Once  more  lawyers  are educated and recruited to take  pro bono cases and the public is 

more  aware  of  the  existing  and  new  resources  available,  the  Commission’s  focus  can  shift  to 

connecting the lawyers with the clients.  The Commission has identified two primary ways that 

clients are currently connected with pro bono lawyers.  One way is through legal aid providers 

federally funded by the Legal Services Corporation (“LSC providers”) and the second is through 

non-LSC  providers.    A  non-LSC  provider  describes  any  organization  that  provides  pro  bono 

legal help but that does not receive federal funding from the Legal Services Corporation.  The 

term includes state and locally funded legal service providers, bar associations, and faith-based 

organizations that provide legal advice and assistance.  A comprehensive pro bono infrastructure 

must include both LSC providers and non-LSC providers. 

Currently, the only widespread pro bono system available to the public consists of the pro 

bono programs of the four regional LSC programs.  Together, their territory covers every county 

in the state.  Federal law requires that at least 12.5% of the federal LSC funding be allocated by 

the  LSC  organization  toward  private  attorney  involvement  or  pro  bono  lawyers.  Even  though 

Tennessee’s LSC programs allocate more than the required amount toward providing pro bono 

services,  they  remain  unable  to  provide  pro  bono  services  in  every  county,  and  Congress 

continues to reduce federal funding.  

Because  of  their  statewide  presence,  LSC  programs  are  presently  the  organizations  to 

which individuals are typically referred for pro bono assistance.  Judges refer litigants to them.  

Notices from the state regarding help with appeal rights for denial of public assistance refer to 

the  LSC  providers.    Lawyers  like  to  be  affiliated  with  them  because  of  their  reputation,  CLE 

opportunities,  screening,  malpractice 

insurance,  and  established  system  for  referrals. 

17 

   

Additionally,  LSC  organizations  have  existing,  solid  partnerships  with  non-LSC  providers  and 

the access to justice community.  Even though LSC providers are unable to take certain types of 

cases  due  to  federal  restrictions,  they  are  not  restricted  from  referring  those  cases  to  other 

attorneys to meet client needs.  

Many non-LSC organizations provide services to a select population or a specific locality 

and  serve  client  populations  that  LSC  providers  cannot  serve.  The  Commission  hopes  to 

encourage other institutions to provide pro bono services.  One such example is the plan adopted 

by  the  Tennessee  and  Memphis  Conferences  of  the  United  Methodist  Church  which  uses  the 

Church’s  existing  infrastructure  and  commitment  to  social  justice  to  partner  with  the 

Commission  to  recruit  member  lawyers  to  provide  pro  bono  services.    (Appendix  J).    The 

Commission has devoted much time and resources to the development of projects such as the Pro 

Bono Summit, Pro Bono Clinic in a Box and endorsed the creation of OnlineTNJustice (which 

serves clients across the state) to create more pro bono opportunities.   

The Commission hopes to serve as a coordinating arm for LSC and non-LSC pro bono 

providers to increase pro bono opportunities, serve in a coordinating and sponsoring role for pro 

bono  activities,  resources  and  statistics  and  develop  innovative  ideas  to  provide  clients  greater 

access  to  justice.    To  accomplish  this  goal  across  the  state,  the  Commission  will  seek  input, 

support  and  feedback  from  pro  bono  service  providers,  the  judiciary,  the  private  bar,  the 

executive  branch,  social  service  providers,  faith-based  institutions,  public  libraries  and  other 

organizations which serve Tennesseans with civil legal needs.  

     To  connect  lawyers  with  clients  through  LSC  and  non-LSC  providers,  the 

Commission  will  provide  a  foundation  for  a  comprehensive  system  of  delivery  of  pro  bono 

services across the state beginning with the following steps: 

18 

   

 

1.  Coordinate regular meetings with the Executive Directors and Pro Bono Directors of 
each of the four LSC providers and with non-LSC providers, the TBA, and TALS to 
determine  the  framework  for  a  comprehensive  approach  to  connect  clients  to 
available resources. 

2.  By  November  1,  2012,  develop  resources  for  intake  staff  to  assist  them  to  make 
referrals  and  foster  accountability  when  their  respective  agency  cannot  provide  the 
client with legal help.  

3.  Explore  the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  statewide  toll  free  information  phone  line 
which  lawyers  staff,  and  the  public  can  access  to  get  information  on  available 
resources throughout the state. 

B.  Goal  2:  The  Commission  Will  Continue  Its  Efforts  to  Assist  Self-Represented 
Persons. 

Although  the  Commission  will  focus  primarily  upon  expanding  pro  bono  services  to 

indigent  Tennesseans,  it  is  inevitable  that  some  Tennesseans  will  not  have  access  to  pro  bono 

help.    This  means  that  there  is  a  pressing  need  for  the  public  to  better  understand  the  legal 

system.    This  need  has  been  particularly  noticed  by  judges,  who  indicated  in  response  to  the 

Commission’s survey that this is an area of special significance and that educational videos could 

help address this need.  (Appendix M—Judges Survey).   

The  Commission  has  made  significant  strides  in  making  the  court-system  more  user-

friendly  and  removing  barriers  for  self-represented  persons.    Court-approved  plain  language 

forms  ensure  that  self-represented  persons  have  acceptable  pleadings.    “Attorney  of  the  Day” 

programs place lawyers in courtrooms to serve as informational sources and to provide limited 

representation to otherwise self-represented persons.   However, there is much more work to do. 

To assist self-represented individuals, the Commission will: 

1.  By  November  1,  2012  produce  a  series  of  educational  videos  for  self-represented 
parties  on  specific  types  of  legal  issues  beginning  with  family  law  and 
debtor/creditor  issues,  general  topics  such  as  “How  to  Prepare  for  Court.”  By 
November 1, 2012, provide instructions on how to complete plain language forms. 
 

19 

 

 

 

 

   

2.  By  April  1,  2013,  develop  and  recommend  additional  plain  language  forms, 
including  expanding  the  divorce  forms  to  include  forms  for  uncontested  divorces 
with minor children.  By October 1, 2013, develop and recommend plain language 
forms regarding child support guidelines.   

3.  Foster  collaboration  with  the  Tennessee  Board  of  Regents  to  use  Technology 
Centers  as  a  centralized  self-help  entity  with  the  goal  of  establishing  one  self-help 
center in each Grand Division by January 1, 2013. 

4.  By  April  1,  2013,  examine  and  make  recommendations  for  systemic  change  in the 
general sessions courts, specifically looking at how attorneys can be more involved 
in  helping  otherwise  self-represented  individuals  through  Attorney  of  the  Day 
programs and limited scope representation 

5.  Create a policy clearly distinguishing between legal information and legal advice to 
provide guidance to court staff, clerks and attorneys assisting in self-help centers on 
or before September 1, 2012. 

6.  By March 1, 2013, expand the General Sessions Court Pro Se Bench Book project 
into  universally  acceptable  instructions  for  all  judges  in  cases  involving  self-
represented parties. 

7.  Develop  sample  plain  language  signage  for  the  courthouse  with  the  assistance  of 
court  staff  to  be  distributed  by  the  AOC  to  court  staff  on  or  before  September  1, 
2012. 

C. Goal 3:  The Commission will continue to develop additional strategies to eliminate 

access to justice barriers.  

Some  of  the  strategies  outlined  above  address  barriers  that  Tennesseans  face  including 

geography,  language,  and  literacy  and  disability.    In  order  to  further  address  disability  and 

language barriers, the Commission will:  

1.  By  December  1,  2012,  offer  Commissioner  and  Committee  member  expertise, 
including  technological  expertise,  to  assist  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts 
with remote interpreting pilot projects, its efforts to encourage agencies to ensure the 
court is aware of the need for interpreters before court hearings, and educate judges, 
clerks,  public  defenders  and  attorneys  general  of  Supreme  Court  Rule  42 
requirement to use credentialed interpreters before non-credentialed interpreters.  

2.  By  December  1,  2012,  offer  assistance  to  agencies  which  provide  services  to 
immigrants  to  provide  education  to  immigrants  on  issues  such  as  U  Visas, 
unaccompanied  immigrant  youth  and  children  in  the  juvenile  courts,  immigrants 

20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

  

accused  of  crimes,  asylum,  eligibility  for  state  benefits,  and  immigrant  issues  in 
family court.  

When  developing  the  2012  Plan,  the  Commission  set  out  to  solidify  Tennessee  as  a 

national leader in the availability of pro bono legal services, in the elimination of barriers to the 

justice  system,  and  in  assisting  the  public  to  understand  and  successfully  engage  the  justice 

system.    To  the  best  of  the  Commission’s  knowledge,  Tennessee  is  the  only  state  that  has 

committed  to  comprehensively  track  the  manner  and  method  in  which  pro  bono  services  are 

provided  to  the  public  and  to  use  that  data  to  provide  accountability  for  the  Access  to  Justice 

programs.  The full support of the Supreme Court and existing collaboration among Tennessee’s 

lawyers  and  its  access  to  justice  community  has  inspired  the  Commission’s  grand,  but 

achievable,  goal  of  increasing  pro  bono  participation  so  that  50%  of  attorneys  residing  in 

Tennessee perform an average of 50 hours of pro bono service as defined by the Supreme Court 

per year.     

The existing network of lawyers, law firms, corporate legal departments, bar associations, 

legal  service  programs,  judges,  clerks,  law  schools,  librarians,  service  providers,  nonprofits, 

faith-based organizations, and businesses will grow as more lawyers are educated,  recruited and 

given  the  skills  to  help  indigent  Tennesseans  with  civil  legal  matters.  Toward  that  end,  the 

Commission will focus on promoting existing resources, growing new resources and technology, 

and  cultivating  partnerships  to  connect  lawyers  with  clients  to  close  the  civil  legal  needs  gap 

while simultaneously advancing projects that eliminate barriers and make the court system more 

user-friendly  for  self-represented  persons.    The  Commission  remains  committed  to  effecting 

systemic change to address the unmet legal needs of the state, for Tennesseans deserve no less

Introduction 

In August 2008, the Tennessee Supreme Court declared Access to Justice its number-

one strategic priority. Later that year, the Court launched its Access to Justice campaign. On 

April 3, 2009, the Court created the Tennessee Access to Justice Commission and charged it 

with developing its first strategic plan within the first year and updating the plan every two 

years thereafter. This 2014 Plan details the progress made in implementing the goals of the 

Commission's  2012 Strategic Plan and  proposes new objectives and benchmarks  to  address 

civil legal needs in the upcoming two years. 

The  Commission's  first  strategic  plan  submitted  in  2010  outlined  how  the  Supreme 

Court began its Access to Justice Initiative and the Court's impressive efforts to carry out this 

initiative.  During  the  past  five  years,  the  Court's  commitment  has  never  wavered.    The 

Court—as individual justices and as a whole—participates in access to justice events and in 

meetings of the Commission and its Advisory Committees1.  The Court also makes prompt 

decisions  to  promote  Access  to  Justice,  and  members  of  the  Court  speak  locally  and 

nationally on this topic. The leadership and visibility of the Court has inspired not only the 

Commission, but also the broader access to justice community, the bar and its associations, 

and  the  court  system  as  a  whole.  The  accomplishments  of  the  past  five  years  reflect  the 

dedication  and  support  of  a  broad  network  of  lawyers,  law  firms,  corporate  legal 

departments, bar associations, legal service programs, judges, clerks, law schools, librarians, 

service providers, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and a wide variety of other entities to 

accomplish these goals.2 

This  2014  Strategic  Plan  also  sets  forth  additional  goals  and  initiatives  to  aid  and 

expedite the Supreme Court's dynamic and ongoing Access to Justice campaign. In particular, 

                                                 
1 Advisory Committees are broad based and diverse committees in topical areas upon which stakeholders and 
persons with expertise serve. 
2 The Commission would be remiss if it did not recognize and thank Justice Janice Holder for serving as the 
Court's liaison to the Commission since its inception. 

 

 

the 2014 Plan focuses on the Commission's first goal, which is to involve more lawyers and 

law  students  in  meeting  legal  needs  so  that  the  public  is  better  served.  Key  to  the 

implementation  of  this  goal  is  a  more  comprehensive  pro  bono  delivery  system  across  the 

state,  which  has  taken  shape  through  the  establishment  of  1-888-aLEGALz  and  the 

publication  of  the  annual  pro  bono  report.  This  2014  Plan  also  addresses  the  necessity  of 

further  public  outreach  and  awareness  of  existing  access  to  justice  resources  for  self-

represented  individuals  and  the  community  at  large.  Finally,  the  2014  Plan  addresses  the 

Commission's commitment to careful measurement of the effectiveness of our collaborative 

efforts  in  order  to  assist  stakeholders  in  directing  resources  to  the  programs  that  most 

effectively address the critical needs of our citizens. 

II. 

Accomplishments and Highlights of the 2012 Strategic Plan. 

At  each  quarterly  meeting,  the  Commission  reviewed  the  2012  Plan  (Appendix  H) 

and  received  an  update  from  each  Committee  chair  regarding  the  Commission's  success  in 

accomplishing  these  goals.  The  Commission  and  its  collaborative  partners  have  met  or 

exceeded most of the goals set in the 2012 Plan. 

A. 

Attorneys  Performing  Pro  Bono  Legal  Services.  One  of  the  overarching 

goals of the 2012 Plan was to increase the number of attorneys who reside in Tennessee and 

provide pro bono services. As of the date of this report, this number represents 44.31% of all 

Tennessee  attorneys,  an  increase  of  26.05 %  since  2010.  The  average  amount  of  hours 

performed  by  those  attorneys  is  an  astounding  74.13  hours  per  year,  far  greater  than  the 

national average. 

B. 

The  Pro  Bono  Report.  As  the  Commission  recognized  in  2012,  a  common 

theme among participants in the national Access to Justice Community is that there is little 

comprehensive  information  regarding  the  pro  bono  activities  in  each  individual  state.  The 

Commission has continued to devote significant resources, primarily staff resources, to create 

2 

 

 

the Pro Bono report so that the Court, bar associations, law schools, direct service providers, 

and other stakeholders can use the report as a resource. 

C. 

Creation of 1-888-aLEGALz. Another important goal in the 2012 Plan was 

the  establishment  of  a  statewide  pro  bono  referral  network.  At  the  time  of  the  2012  Plan, 

Online  Tennessee  Justice,  the  nation's  first  interactive  pro  bono  website,  was  already  in 

service. This website provides limited scope advice to eligible clients across Tennessee and 

provides lawyers with the opportunity to provide pro bono services whenever and wherever 

they  can  access  a  computer  or  mobile  device.  The  Commission  learned  early  in  2012  that 

other states had successfully launched statewide toll-free numbers to answer legal questions 

from clients and to connect available resources with clients who needed help.  

With a grant from the Court (from CLE late fees paid by lawyers to the Commission 

on Continuing Legal Education and a $75,000 grant from International Paper Corporation), 1-

888-aLEGALz was launched in collaboration with the Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services. 

This is Tennessee's first statewide, toll-free, legal-resource helpline. The hotline is staffed by 

Tim Hughes, an alumnus of Memphis Area  Legal Services, and is housed at the Tennessee 

Alliance for Legal Services offices. This helpline can provide basic legal advice to callers or 

when more than basic or limited scope advice is needed, Tim Hughes can direct the client to 

available  resources.  The  launch  of  1-888-aLEGALz  is  another  important  and  meaningful 

stride towards establishing a statewide referral network for pro bono services in Tennessee. 

Together,  Online  Tennessee  Justice  and  aLEGALz  provide  important  access  to  legal 

information  and  legal  advice  for  all  Tennesseans.    The  latest  periodic  reports  for  1-888-

aLEGALz and Online Tennessee Justice are attached hereto as Appendix J. 

D. 

Education  of  Volunteer  Lawyers  and  Self-Represented  Litigants.  The 

2012  Plan  recognized  that  education  for  self-represented  litigants  as  well  as  for  attorneys 

willing  to  provide  pro  bono  services  is  a  critical  element  if  Tennessee  is  to  succeed  in 

3 

 

 

involving more lawyers and providing more services where the needs are the greatest. To that 

end,  the  Commission  developed  an  online  curriculum  in  high-needs  areas  of  the  law 

beginning with family law. The Commission also assisted in coordinating development of pro 

bono initiatives in law schools and involved the judiciary by asking judges to participate in 

online webcasts. 

E.  Marketing and Public Relations. Pursuant to the 2012 Plan, the Commission 

recommended  that  the  Court  establish  a  Supreme  Court  recognition  program.  This  Court-

recognition initiative began in the first quarter of 2014 and honors lawyers who perform 50 

hours of pro bono work per year. Law students who perform 50 hours of pro bono work while 

in  law  school  will  be  honored  as  Volunteers  for  Justice  upon  graduation.  Law  offices  that 

average 50 hours of pro bono work per lawyer will be recognized also. The Court has created 

and registered a trademarked seal for use  by  law  students and lawyers  on résumés, website 

listings,  and  other  materials  disseminated  to  the  public  relating  to  those  lawyers  or  law 

offices.  An  image  of  the  seal  is  attached  as  Appendix  K.  The  Court  will  hold  a  series  of 

regional events beginning in July 2014 to honor these lawyers, law students, and law offices. 

F. 

The  Pillar  Law  Firm  Initiative.  Building  on  the  partnership  model 

established by Nashville law firms and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the 

Cumberlands,  the  Commission  facilitated  the  launch  of  Pillar  Law  Firm  programs  in 

Memphis,  Knoxville,  and  Chattanooga.  Pursuant  to  the  Pillar  Law  Firm  model,  firms  with 

strong commitments to pro bono educate their attorneys on substantive areas of the law and 

take more pro bono cases in those substantive areas. This model allows the firms to develop 

special expertise across levels of seniority, organize groups topically within their firms, and 

create client teams to work on their pro bono assignments. 

G. 

Faith-Based  Initiatives  and  Facilitating  the  Creation  of  New  Pro  Bono 

Clinics.  In  February  2013,  the  Court  and  Commission  launched  the  Tennessee  Faith  & 

4 

 

 

Justice  Alliance  ("TFJA"),  an  alliance  of  faith-based  groups  in  Tennessee  created  to  align 

needs seen at the local church level with possible legal resources that are nearby, perhaps in 

the same congregation, and committed to providing legal resources to their congregations and 

communities. The notion is to connect with people in need in a place where they already go 

to  seek  help  with  a  problem,  which  is  quite  often  their  place  of  worship.  The  TFJA  also 

provides opportunities to help to attorneys who have not otherwise participated in organized 

pro  bono  but  are  motivated  to  serve  their  church  through  a  pro  bono  program.  The 

Commission  has  partnered  with  the  Tennessee  Alliance  for  Legal  Services  to  provide 

malpractice insurance to participating attorneys. 

The  Tennessee  Conference  of  the  United  Methodist  Church  (“UMC”)  served  as  the 

location of the initiative’s pilot project, which was designed to pair an attorney with a place 

of worship. When a leader or clergy member of that congregation learns of a member's legal 

need, that leader can refer the person to a  local attorney  who has volunteered to  serve  as a 

resource for that congregation. That attorney in turn will provide the legal advice needed or 

make connections with other resources that can provide necessary services. 

The  UMC  model  is  just  one  way  to  offer  services.  The  flexibility  of  the  TFJA 

program  allows  communities  to  design  programs  to  meet  their  local  needs.    For  example, 

Cross  Point  Church  in  Nashville  organized  legal  teams  that  partner  with  addiction 

rehabilitation  organizations.  The  legal  teams  work  with  program  graduates  to  deal  with 

outstanding legal issues that may impede the graduates' success after their rehabilitation. The 

legal  teams  are  composed  of  church  member  attorneys  and  law  students.  The  law  students 

complete client intake, conduct legal research, and draft motions, while the attorneys oversee 

their work. If a court appearance is required to remedy the situation, the attorneys represent 

the client in court. 

The clinic started at Lipscomb University, a Christian institution, is another example.

The Lipscomb Institute for Law, Justice & Society recruited alumni attorneys to serve at bi-

monthly, free, walk-in legal clinics. 

H. 

Assistance  to  Self-Represented  Litigants.  The  Commission  has  produced a 

series of educational videos for self-represented litigants. It has developed and recommended 

plain-language  forms  for  self-represented  litigants  and  has  expanded  the  available  divorce 

forms to include forms for the uncontested divorce of parties with minor children. It has also 

developed plain-language resources regarding child support guidelines. 

Working  with  the  General  Sessions  Judges  Conference,  the  Commission  has 

examined and made recommendations to increase attorney involvement in helping otherwise 

self-represented  individuals  through  Attorney-of-the-Day  programs  and  other  limited-scope 

representation initiatives in the General Sessions courts. 

Also,  in  collaboration  with  the  Tennessee  General  Sessions  Judges  Conference,  a 

General  Sessions  court  pro  se  bench  book,  “Meeting  the  Challenges  of  Self-Represented 

Litigants,” has been created and circulated and is now being used as a model for the creation 

of a Circuit and Chancery Court Pro Se Bench Book.3    Supplemental Guidelines for self-

represented litigants were also created in conjunction with the Bench Book. 

In  collaboration  with  the  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility,  the  Commission 

recommended and  the Court adopted a policy distinguishing  between  legal information  and 

legal advice that continues to provide guidance to court staff, clerks, and attorneys. 

The  Commission  has  developed  plain-language  signage  for  courthouses  and 

distributed it to courts across the state. 

The  Court  has  also  made  the  Access  to  Justice  website  and  the  Supplemental 

Guidelines referenced above available in Spanish.

Judges Conference for their great work in this area.

I. 

Recruitment  of  Additional  Lawyers  and  Law  Students  for  Pro  Bono 

Work.  The  2012  Plan  included  a  goal  of  increasing  the  number  of  law  firms  and  legal 

departments with formal pro bono policies. The Commission, through its pro bono committee 

and in collaboration with the Tennessee Bar Association, has surpassed its goal of increasing 

by  15  the  number  of  law  firms  and  legal  departments  that  have  adopted  pro  bono  policies. 

Seventeen additional law firms and legal departments have adopted formal pro bono policies.  

The  Commission  convened  a  telephone  conference  of  law  school  deans  and  law 

school  pro  bono  directors  in  the  fall  of  2012  and  participated  in  statewide  law  school 

conferences in January and September of 2013 to increase pro bono participation among law 

students and law faculty. Members of the  Court attended all three events. The Commission 

has also convened four quarterly telephone conferences with legal services entities and non-

legal services direct providers to discuss issues affecting the legal services community and to 

coordinate the Commission's efforts with these providers. 

III.  The Commission's Strategic Vision. 

 

At this point in the Commission's history, the Court, the Commission, and all of the 

collaborative partners in the access to justice community can be rightfully proud of what has 

been  accomplished  in  these  past  five  years4.  State  and  local  bar  associations,  legal  service 

providers,  non-legal  service  providers,  law  schools,  faith-based  organizations,  libraries, and 

persons and entities too numerous to name have established an extensive mosaic of resources 

that serves as a strong foundation from which to build. The Commission's challenge and the 

challenge  of  the  cause  of  equal  access  to justice  generally,  are  to  create and  improve  upon 

programs and processes that will allow Tennessee to sustain its momentum. 

 

                                                 
4 The National Center for Access to Justice at Cardozo Law School’s Justice Index, found at 
http://www.justiceindex.org, is a model for improving the quality of justice through the use of performance 
measurement.  The web-based system gathers and presents data showing the extent to which each of our 50-
state justice systems succeeds in assuring access to all.  Tennessee scored in the top 10.    

7 

 

 

To that end, our overarching strategic goal remains to increase access to justice for all 

citizens  of  Tennessee  by  engaging  more  Tennessee  lawyers  in  the  provision  of  pro  bono 

services.  With a growing population in poverty and shrinking financial resources, however, 

our goals must now involve measurement of the effectiveness of our efforts.  

 

The Commission is no longer satisfied simply to propose new rules or to launch new 

programs.  The  Commission  commits  to  measure  the  impact  that  our  work  is  having  on  the 

lives  of  Tennesseans.  This  disciplined  approach  will  allow  us  to  place  emphasis  on  the 

programs that have been the most effective, to discontinue spending resources on programs 

that  have  not  been  effective,  and  to  use  new technologies  and  the  new  information  that  we 

gather to leverage existing programs and launch new programs where the need is the greatest. 

In  the  Commission's  judgment,  the  next  stage  in  the  evolution  of  the  Court's  work,  and  in 

fact,  the  cause  of  equal  justice  in  general,  is  to  strive  toward  making  the  most  profound 

difference possible in the lives of Tennesseans with the human, financial, and technological 

resources available to us. 

 

The  Commission  also  recognizes  there  will  continue  to  be  instances  when  a  person 

cannot afford the cost of a traditional lawyer, does not have access to pro bono resources, and 

will  be  required  to  represent  themselves  in  court.  The  Commission  commits  to  developing 

additional resources directed towards low-income Tennesseans who must navigate the court 

system  without  the  benefit  of  counsel.  In  addition,  existing  resources  available  for  self-

represented  litigants  will  be  a  component  of  the  Commission’s  public-awareness  efforts 

going forward. 

IV. 

Summary of Recommendations for the 2014-2016 Strategic Plan. 

A. 

Assess Legal Needs. The last state-wide legal needs study done in Tennessee 

was published in 2004 and utilized data collected in 2003.  In order for the Commission and 

its  collaborative  partners  to  refine  existing  programs  and  launch  new  initiatives  that  will 

8 

 

 

impact the most Tennesseans in  the  most profound way, the Commission believes  that it is 

now time to reassess legal needs in Tennessee. From the working poor to the homeless, we 

need  a  more  recent  and  accurate  snapshot  of  the  types  of  needs  that  now  exist,  the 

Tennesseans who have the most profound need for legal services, and the location of those 

needs throughout our state. 

 

Thanks  to  a  generous  grant  from  the  Ansley  Fund  of  the  Frist  Foundation  and  in 

collaboration  with  the  Tennessee  Alliance  for  Legal  Services  and  the  Tennessee  Bar 

Association,  a  new  legal  needs  study  has  been  undertaken.  This  legal  needs  study  will  be 

performed by the University of Tennessee School of Social Work, which conducted the study 

published in 2004. This new study will give us reliable and current information that we can 

use  across  the  spectrum  of  programs  and  initiatives  to  triage  our  efforts  and  direct  our 

resources  in  the  most  effective  way.5  We  expect  that  this  survey  will  be  available  for 

distribution in the third quarter of 2014. See Appendix K for a description of the legal needs 

study.

Disseminate  Information  About  Existing  Resources.  The  Commission  has 

created videos for volunteer attorneys and for the public. The Tennessee Bar Association and 

the  Tennessee  Alliance 

for  Legal  Services 

have 

collaborated 

to 

launch 

www.OnlineTNJustice.com,  the  nation's  first  interactive,  pro  bono  website.  The  Tennessee 

Alliance for Legal Services, with financial assistance from International Paper and the Court 

and with the assistance of the Tennessee Bar Association, has launched 1-888-aLEGALz, a 

legal advice and information toll-free line. In the Commission's judgment, however, many of 
                                                 
5 A recent economic impact study done in our neighboring state of North Carolina showed that civil access to 
justice programs resulted in $18,024,411 of direct benefit, $13,893,362 of indirect estimated impact, 
$16,857,503 in cost savings, and a total economic impact of $48,775,327 in the state.  We expect to also 
complete an economic impact study in Tennessee by the end of 2014.

these  resources,  and  others,  are  underutilized.  Public  awareness  of  the  available  resources, 

therefore, deserves careful attention over the next two years. 

One  step,  for  example,  will  be  the  creation  of  a  poster  to  be  displayed  in  clerks’ 

offices  and  other  locations  informing  the  public  of  available  resources.  This  poster  will 

include a Quantum Point Contact (“QPC”) code that smart phone  users can scan to receive 

more  information.  The  Commission  will  also  target  centers  of  community  contact  such  as 

laundry mats, health clinics, and public transportation and will send a monthly email to social 

agencies.  The  Commission  will  also  utilize  social  media  to  disseminate  information  and  to 

explore the use of public service announcements on radio and television.

C. 

Establish  Direct  Communication  Channels  with  Volunteers.  In  the 

Commission's  judgment,  the  Court  itself  should  have  the  capability  of  direct  emailing  to 

attorneys  through  the  Commission  or  other  channels.  The  Tennessee  Bar  Association, 

utilizing its award winning member service, TBA Today, has been a most generous partner in 

helping  the  Court  and  Commission  inform  Tennessee  lawyers  about  access  to  justice 

developments. Likewise, the Board of Professional Responsibility has been a full partner in 

helping  the  Court  and  the  Commission  communicate  with  lawyers  with  regard  to  access  to 

justice issues. The Commission places tremendous value on these collaborative relationships; 

however,  the  Commission  believes  that  it  should  also  have  its  own  process  for  emailing 

Tennessee  lawyers  to  inform  them  of  needs,  available  resources,  pro  bono  volunteer 

opportunities,  and  Court  recognition  programs.  To  that  end,  the  Commission  will,  with  the 

Court's  permission,  obtain  the  information  it  needs  to  send  its  own  emails  to  Tennessee 

lawyers.

D. 

Recommend  a  Pro  Bono  Reporting  Requirement  to  the  Court.  Just  as 

more  information  and  new  information  are  needed  regarding  the  legal  needs  of  Tennessee 

citizens, more information is necessary to evaluate the pro bono services being rendered and 

 

11 

 

  G

 

 

the  volunteers  providing  those  services.  In  recent  years,  the  number  of  Tennessee  lawyers 

reporting their pro bono hours has risen from 18% to more than 44%. At times, that number 

has  been  as  high  as  48%,  extremely  close  to  the  goal  stated  in  the  2012  Strategic  Plan  of 

having 50% of Tennessee attorneys voluntarily providing pro bono services. However, even 

if  50%  of  Tennessee  attorneys  report  providing  pro  bono  services,  this  information  still 

presents  an  incomplete  picture  of  how  much  pro  bono  is  being  performed  and  who  is 

volunteering.  Although  the  Commission  is  unanimously  against  mandatory  pro  bono  and 

strongly  in  favor  of  maintaining  the  confidentiality  of  each  individual  attorney's  pro  bono 

information, the Commission has, since its inception, believed that the Court should require 

attorneys to report their pro bono hours with their annual registration. 

Reporting  pro  bono  does  not  require  record  keeping  and  certainly  will  not  involve 

after-the-fact audits. Requiring attorneys to estimate their pro bono hours has never been, as 

some have claimed, a gateway to requiring that attorneys perform pro bono services. Reports 

by  individual  lawyers  should  be  kept  confidential  unless  confidentiality  is  waived  by  the 

lawyer so that the Court may recognize those lawyers who have provided pro bono services. 

Just as it is important to understand the legal needs in Tennessee, it is important to understand 

how much pro bono service is being rendered and by whom. This information is invaluable 

with respect to planning and triaging initiatives, legislative policy, and grant applications, to 

name  a  few.  Reporting  estimated,  pro  bono  hours  should  take  most  lawyers  less  than  one 

minute to note on their annual registration form. (The Commission will explore the feasibility 

of reporting directly to the Commission rather than through the BPR.)

E. 

Target  the  Needs  of  Tennesseans  in  the  Area  of  Family  Law.  All  of  the 

providers  in  the  field  and  all  of  the  volunteers  at  the  clinics,  as  well  as  the  data  captured 

through  Online  Tennessee  Justice  and  1-888-aLEGALz,  indicate  that  Tennessee's  most 

profound  need  is  in  the  area  of  family  law.    For  example,  there  are  few  resources  for  low 

income Tennesseans with custody issues and few options for a spouse that does not control 

the  marital  assets  to  afford  the  traditional  cost  of  hiring  a  lawyer.    In  keeping  with  the 

Commission's  commitment  to  place  emphasis  where  it  can  best  impact  the  lives  of 

Tennesseans, the Commission will target family law by steering existing Pillar Law Firms to 

family  law  cases  and  recruiting  additional  Pillar  Law  Firms  who  will  handle  family  law 

cases.    The  Commission  will  also  assist  LSC  providers  create  and  expand  existing  divorce 

clinics, update and promote existing and upcoming plain language divorce forms, create new 

plain  language  family  law  forms,  recruit  more  mediators  to  perform  pro  bono  family 

mediations, promote the use of the limited scope representation rule in family law cases.

F. 

Target  The  Needs  Of  Rural  Tennesseans.  While  family  law  is  the  topical 

area on which the Commission commits to focus, the Commission also believes that the legal 

needs  of  Tennesseans  living  in  rural  areas  should  be  a  strategic  focus.  The  Commission 

commits to establishing new clinics in rural judicial districts. The Commission will also use 

new  technologies  to  meet  the  needs  of  Tennesseans  living  in  rural  areas  where  few  or  no 

volunteer attorneys are available. Our ultimate goal is to have either an in-person clinic or a 

remote clinic using mobile devices occur periodically and reliably in every judicial district.

Hold a Tennessee Faith and Justice Summit. The Commission will host the 

first-ever  statewide  gathering  of  faith-based  organizations  and  pro  bono  lawyers  with  a 

common  interest  in  assisting  Tennesseans  with  civil  legal  problems.  The  Summit  will 

highlight  the  Tennessee  Faith  and  Justice  Alliance.  This  Summit  will  be  used  as  a  way  to 

refine  the  processes and  training,  evaluate  the  interests  in  existing  entities,  and  recruit  new 

entities for the initiative.

H. 

Expand  and  Enhance  the  Effectiveness  of  the  Faith-based  Initiative  and 

the Tennessee Faith and Justice Alliance. The Commission's role with respect to the faith-

based  initiative  and  the  Tennessee  Faith  and  Justice  Alliance  should  be  one  of  recruiting, 

incubation, training, and monitoring. In the Commission's judgment, the key to an effective 

faith-based  program  is  to  have  champions  within  organizations  who  will  promote  the 

program,  recruit  volunteers,  and  make  sure  that  the  initiative  is  functioning  properly.  It  is 

impossible  for  the  Commission  staff  to  perform  that  role  for  faith-based  entities  and 

simultaneously  expand  the  number  of  programs  serving  Tennesseans  and  the  number  of 

Tennesseans who are served. 

Accordingly,  the  Commission  has  decided  to  direct  staff  resources  to  those  entities 

with a well-functioning champion in place. Our staff can provide a template for establishing 

   

Goal:  

14 

 

 

 

 

an initiative and help train the original champion or champions within each entity. Our staff 

should  then  move  on  to  recruiting  the  next  entity  and  assisting  them  with  launching  their 

programs.  In  keeping  with  this  strategic  plan's  theme  of  carefully  marshaling  resources  to 

have the most  profound  effect on the largest number  of Tennesseans, our role  should be to 

recruit  receptive  new  entities  and  train  the  champions  within  those  entities.  This  approach 

should be effective immediately and should be ongoing throughout the term of this strategic 

plan.

Use the American Bar Association (“ABA”) Innovation Grant to Promote 

Rural Faith-Based Projects. In keeping with the Commission's focus on meeting the needs 

of rural Tennesseans, the Commission is committed to meeting the requirements of our ABA 

Innovation Grant by having two rural projects up and running by May 2014. The two projects 

are  expanding  the  referral  model  piloted  by  the  Tennessee  Conference  of  the  United 

Methodist  Church  under  the  TFJA  and  creating  a  new  faith-based  clinic  in  a  rural  county. 

Under  the  grant,  the  Commission  is  charged  with  developing  a  model  to  assist  in  the 

replication  of  this  project.  The  pilot  project  adopted  by  the  Tennessee  Conference  of  the 

United Methodist Church will serve as the prototype for the model. The pilot project has been 

in  existence  for  a  year,  and  the  Commission  will  modify  the  pilot  project  so  that  it  can  be 

applied universally and will develop best practices for adopting the model.

Continue to Develop And Monitor the Use of Plain Language Forms. Plain 

language  forms  for  self-represented  litigants  are  important.  The  Commission  commits  to 

15 

measuring the effectiveness of these forms by monitoring the number of times a form is viewed 

or  downloaded  from  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Court  website  or  the  Access  to  Justice 

website. The Commission will also work with the State Court Clerks Association of Tennessee

self-represented  litigants  a  series  of  questions  and  uses  the  answers  to  populate  the  necessary 

forms.  The  Commission  will  research  other  states  and  entities  using  similar  programs  to  assist

Provide  For  Additional  Pro  Bono  Mediation.  Supreme  Court  Rule  50,

The Commission shall encourage the Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission and 

other  groups  to  provide  pro  bono  and  reduced-rate  mediation  services  to  self-

represented litigants, and to litigants who, although represented, have modest means 

or who are pro bono clients. 

Tennessee is fortunate to have pro bono mediation centers and pro bono mediator-of-the-day 

programs in some communities. The ATJ Commission will work with the ADR Commission 

to  increase  the  number  of  pro  bono  mediators  providing  pro  bono  mediations.  The 

Commission chair will also create a mediation committee that will work to replicate mediator 

of  the  day  programs,  pro  bono  mediation  centers  in  more  judicial  districts,  and  connect 

individual mediators in rural areas with opportunities to do pro bono mediation, specifically 

in family law matters.

Commission  will  use  law  students  to  further  the  projects  outlined  in  this  Plan.    The 

Commission will carry on its partnership with the law schools and TBA ATJ Committee and 

facilitate  annual  meetings  of  law  school  Deans,  faculty,  and  students  to  emphasize  the 

importance of doing pro bono work while in law school.  The Commission will also promote

M.  Make The  Public Aware of Existing  Resources. As in many states, one of 

the challenges faced by our Commission and the access to justice community generally is the 

connection of resources to need. Some resources, of course, are fully utilized at this time. For 

example,  1-888-aLEGALz  is  being  utilized  to  the  fullest  capacity  of  the  existing  staff  and 

volunteers.  Based  on  the  number  of  volunteers  signed  up  for  Online  Tennessee  Justice, 

however, it could be more fully utilized if the public were more aware of it. In addition, the 

Commission  has  received  reports  of  limited  scope  clinics  with  very  low  lawyer-to-client 

ratios. The Commission has also observed that there are Pillar Law Firms in some cities that 

are not receiving as many case assignments as they could handle. Finally, as of January 2014, 

there are more  than 65 law firms and legal departments  that have adopted  formal  pro  bono 

plans or policies. The Commission has observed that some of these firms are fully utilizing 

their  plans  and  are  being  called  upon  to  provide  pro  bono  services  pursuant  to  their  plan’s 

structure.  Other  legal  departments  and  firms  with  pro  bono  plans,  however,  are  not  being 

fully utilized or are not being utilized at all. 

The  Commission  will  recruit  a  full  complement  of  lawyers  and  non-lawyers  with 

public  awareness  skills  and/or  public  relations  backgrounds  to  the  Public  Awareness 

Committee. The committee will operate on two fronts: the first is to make the public aware of 

existing  resources;  and  the  second  is  to  make  sure  lawyers  are  aware  of  opportunities  to 

provide  pro  bono  services,  are  trained  to  provide  those  services,  and are  recognized  by  the 

Court for volunteering their time and expertise.

Data Management.  A focus of this Strategic Plan will be to capture data that 

with  respect  to  the  legal  needs  of  Tennesseans,  the  opportunities  to  recruit  additional  pro 

bono volunteers, and the effectiveness of the pro bono services being provided measures the 

extent to which we are impacting the lives of our fellow Tennesseans in a positive way. Some 

data  collection  is  already  taking  place  through  the  Commission’s  strategic  partners  such  as 

pro bono clinic providers and the Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services with aLEGALz and 

Online Tennessee Justice. The Commission will gather existing data and develop a universal 

data-collection tool for clinic providers and pro bono programs to submit to the Commission. 

Other  initiatives  such  as  Pillar  Law  Firms,  pro  bono  policy  adoption,  and  usage  of  plain 

language  forms  have  not  reported  data  or  the  Commission  has  not  collected  the  data.  The 

Commission  will  begin  to  collect  data on these types of initiatives.  To the extent possible, 

the  Commission  will  work  with  its  partners  to  develop  a  universal  instrument  to  survey 

clients  on  their  satisfaction  with  the  pro  bono  assistance  they  received.    To  enable  the 

Commission and its partners to determine where to focus resources and how to move forward 

to  provide  low  income  Tennesseans  access  to  the  judicial  system,  the  Commission  will 

develop a data-management system, which will be a central repository for these data. 

Develop universal measurement tool for clinic providers and 
pro bono programs, implement tool, collect existing data for 
other sources, and develop data management system. 
Develop measurement tool by June 2, 2014; Implementation 
and collection by October 1, 2014; Develop data management

As with the 2012 Strategic Plan, this new Plan is ambitious and will require hard work 

and  continuous  focus  by  the  Commission  and,  as  always,  our  volunteers  and  collaboration 

partners. Nevertheless, the Commission is mindful that access to justice is the Court's primary 

strategic priority and the needs of our fellow citizens will never abate. We approach this plan, 

and the work it represents, therefore with a strong sense of urgency. Our fellow Tennesseans 

deserve no less.

A woman called the helpline after nearly $5,000 was taken 
from her bank account by a creditor.  While her only source 
of income is social security disability, her son's student 
loans  and grants were also placed in her bank account.  
The helpline attorney advised the caller and then 
transferred her to her local legal aid program where an 
attorney agreed to take her case and is working to get the 
money released back to her account.

lawyers interested in providing pro bono work through the 
four LSC-funded legal aid programs and onlinetnjustice.org.  
There are also new links for mediation and the Supreme 
Court's faith based initiative.  The search features have been 
updated to allow users to more easily find their local legal 
aid program.  Through its advisory council and outreach 
efforts, Help4TN is building a coalition with librarians and 
211 operations across the state so Tennesseans can find the 
legal and social services they need.

Client Story 

A helpline caller was facing a claw back claim from the Social 
Security Administration relating to overpayment of social 
security disability benefits.  We referred the caller to 
OnlineTnJustice.org for advice and advised him to call legal 
aid if the issue remained unresolved. The helpline attorney 
followed up with the caller to check in on the outcome, 
and  the caller reported that his issue was successfully 
resolved by our referral to  onlineTnJustice.org.  An OTJ 
volunteer who had recently handled a similar case took the 
question and was able to coach the client through the 
process, empowering him to resolve the issue and saving 
legal aid’s resources.

July 2014 Access

&
July 2015 Access 
to Justice Update 

Access to Justice Quarterly Update

The Supreme Court declared Access to Justice its number one strategic priority in
2008.  In 2009, the Court appointed the Access to Justice Commission and directed it
to develop a strategic plan and update the plan every two years.  The ATJ Commission
is now operating under its third strategic plan that encompasses 2014 – 2015.  As part
of its plan, the ATJ Commission identified the need to directly communicate with
Tennessee attorneys.  This is the first such communication, and the ATJ Commission
will continue to update Tennessee attorneys on newsworthy events in the ATJ
community. 

Supreme Court Pro Bono Recognition Program. 

The Supreme Court launched a program to recognize pro bono service by individual 
attorneys, law firms, and law students.  Attorneys can be recognized if they provided 50 or 
more hours of pro bono service in 2013.  Law firms can be recognized if the firm averaged 
50 or more hours of pro bono service per attorney in 2013.  The Court will hold public 
recognition events in October for attorneys, law firms, and law students. Attorneys who 
wish to be recognized must report their pro bono hours when they renew their BPR 
registration.  During the first year of recognition, attorneys can also apply to be recognized 
for their pro bono service by completing the application found here and returning it to the 
ATJ Coordinator at the Administrative Office of the Courts. Law firms can apply by 
completing and returning the application found here.  For more information, go to the ATJ 
page on the AOC website.  The deadline to apply by  application is June 30, 2014.  

Looking for pro bono opportunities?

There are many ways you can provide pro bono service, from taking a case through your 
local legal aid provider and volunteering at a pro bono legal clinic to answering questions 
online at your convenience.  Please refer to Supreme Court Rule 8, Section 6.1, which 
provides a definition of pro bono service eligible for recognition. The ATJ Initiative website, 
www.JusticeForAllTN.com, lists the contact information for all of the legal aid providers and 
all of the pro bono legal clinics across the state.  Online Tennessee Justice is an online 
legal clinic where you can respond to legal questions posted on the website.  Go to 
www.OnlineTNJustice.org for more information and to register. 

1-888-aLEGALz.

The ATJ Commission helped launch aLEGALz, a toll free, statewide legal information 
hotline, in January 2013.  Users call the hotline and an attorney returns their calls and 
provides information concerning legal resources in their areas.  This resource is available 
to all Tennesseans, regardless of their income.  It’s a great place to send people when 
you’re not able to represent them.  Please see the Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services 
website for more information.

ATJ Initiative Update
July 2015

The Supreme Court declared Access to Justice its number one strategic
priority  in  2008.    In  2009,  the  Court  appointed  the  Access  to  Justice
Commission and directed it to develop a strategic plan and update the
plan  every  two  years.  The  ATJ  Commission  is  now  operating  under  its
third strategic plan that encompasses 2014 – 2015. As part of its plan,
the  ATJ  Commission  identified  the  need  to  periodically  communicate
updates directly with Tennessee attorneys.

Supreme Court Pro Bono Recognition Program

Attorneys who did 50 or more hours
of pro bono work in the previous
calendar year may apply to be
recognized as a 2015 Attorney for
Justice directly on the AOC
website. The application deadline is
July 31, 2015. Attorneys may also
apply for recognition by reporting
their pro bono work when they renew
their license with BPR. Law offices are
eligible to be recognized for pro bono
work done by their attorneys by
submitting an application directly to
the AOC.  

Optional Donation to
ATJ Programs on
Annual BPR Registration Form

Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 9 was
recently modified to provide attorneys
an opportunity to make a financial
donation to access to justice
programs. The annual registration
form that must be submitted to the
BPR contains a section that allows
attorneys to make the optional
donation. The Rule went into effect on
July 1, 2015. More information is
available here.

Appendix L: 

Supreme Court
Rule 9, Section10 

Supreme Court Rule 9.  Disciplinary Enforcement 

Section 10.  Periodic Assessment of Attorneys 

10.1.  Every attorney  admitted to  practice before the Court, except  those exempt under 
Section 10.3 (b) and (c), shall, on or before the first day of their birth month, file with the Board 
at its central office an annual registration statement, on a form prescribed by the Board, setting 
forth the attorney’s current residence, office, and email addresses, and such other information as 
the  Board  may  direct.   The  attorney's  residence  address,  cellular  telephone  number,  home 
telephone number, and personal non-government issued e-mail address are confidential and not 
public records. If, however, (1) the attorney failed to provide an office address , office telephone 
number,  or  office  e-mail  address;  or  (2)  the  attorney  listed  the  residence  address,  cellular 
telephone number or home telephone number, or personal non-government issued e-mail address 
as the attorney's office  address, office telephone  number, or  office e-mail address  respectively, 
then the attorney's nonpublic information of the same category shall no longer be subject to the 
protection afforded under this Rule. The attorney may designate the primary or preferred address 
for  receipt  of  correspondence  from  the  Board.   In  addition  to  such  annual  statement,  every 
attorney  shall  file  with  the  Board  as  necessary  a  supplemental  statement  of  any  change  in 
information previously submitted within thirty days of such change. 

10.2.  (a) Every attorney admitted to practice before the Court, except those exempt under 
Section 10.3, shall pay to the Board on or before the first day of the attorney’s birth month an 
annual fee. 

  

(b)  All  funds  collected  hereunder  shall  be  deposited  by  the  Board  with  the  State 
Treasurer; all such funds, including earnings on investments and all interest and proceeds from 
said  funds,  if  any,  are  deemed  to  be,  and  shall  be  designated  as,  funds  belonging  solely  to  the 
Board.   Withdrawals  from  those  funds  shall  be  made  by  the  Board  only  for  the  purpose  of 
defraying  the  costs  of  disciplinary  administration  and  enforcement  of  this  Rule,  and  for  such 
other related purposes as the Court may from time to time authorize or direct. 

  

(c)  The  annual  fee  for  each  attorney  shall  be  One  Hundred  Seventy  Dollars  ($170), 
consisting  of  a  One  Hundred  Forty  Dollar  ($140)  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility  annual 
registration fee, a Ten Dollar ($10) annual fee due under Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 25, Section 2.01(a) 
(Tennessee  Lawyers’  Fund  for  Client  Protection),  and  a  Twenty  Dollar  ($20)  annual  fee  due 
under Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 33.01C (Tennessee Lawyer Assistance Program), and shall be payable 
on or before the first day of the attorney’s birth month, and a like sum each year thereafter until 
otherwise ordered by the Court. 

  

(d)  In  connection  with  the  payment  of  the  annual  fee,  every  attorney  shall  have  the 
opportunity to make a financial contribution to support access-to-justice programs. Funds raised 
through  optional  contributions  will  be  distributed  to  access-to-justice  programs  which  provide 
direct legal services to low income Tennesseans. 

10.3.  There shall be exempted from the application of this rule: 

 (a) Attorneys who serve as a justice, judge, or magistrate judge of a court of the United

federal law from engaging in the practice of law. 

(b) Retired attorneys. 

(c) Attorneys on temporary duty with the armed forces. 

(d) Faculty members of Tennessee law schools who do not practice law. 

  

(e) Attorneys not engaged in the practice of law in Tennessee.  The term “the practice of

duties,  regulations,  liabilities,  or  business  relations  of  one  requiring  the  services.   It  shall 
encompass all public and private positions in which the attorney may be called upon to examine 
the law or pass upon the legal effect of any act, document, or law. 

10.4. Within  thirty  days  of  the  receipt  of  a  statement  or  supplement  thereto  filed  by  an 
attorney  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section  10.1,  the  Board,  acting  through 
Disciplinary  Counsel,  shall  acknowledge  receipt  thereof,  on  a  form  prescribed  by  the  Court  in 
order  to  enable  the  attorney  on  request  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  the  requirements  of 
Sections 10.1 and 10.2 

10.5.  The Board monthly shall compile lists of attorneys who have failed to timely file 
the annual registration statement required by Section 10.1 or have failed to timely pay the annual 
registration fee required by Section 10.2.  The Board shall send to each attorney listed thereon an 
Annual  Registration  Fee/Statement  Delinquency  Notice  (the  “Notice”).  The  Notice  shall  state 
that the attorney has failed to timely file the annual registration statement required by Tenn. Sup. 
Ct. R. 9, Section 10.1, or has failed to timely pay the annual registration  fee required by Tenn. 
Sup.  Ct.  R.  9,  Section  10.2,  and  that  the  attorney’s  license  therefore  is  subject  to  suspension 
pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9, Section 10.6. The Notice shall be sent to the attorney by a form 
of United States mail providing delivery confirmation, at the primary or preferred address shown 
in  the  attorney’s  most  recent  registration  statement  filed  pursuant  to  Section  10.1  or  at  the 
attorney’s  last  known  address,  and  at  the  email  address  shown  in  the  attorney’s  most  recent 
registration  statement  filed  pursuant  to  Section  10.1  or  at  the  attorney’s  last  known  email 
address. 

10.6.  (a) Each attorney to whom a Notice is sent pursuant to Section 10.5 shall file with 
the Board within thirty days of the date of mailing of the Notice an affidavit or declaration under 
penalty  of  perjury  with  supporting  documentation  demonstrating  that  the  attorney  has  paid  the 
annual  registration fee or has filed  the  annual  registration statement,  and  has paid  a delinquent 
compliance  fee  of  One  Hundred  Dollars  ($100.00)  to  defray  the  Board’s  costs  in  issuing  the 
Notice;  or,  alternatively,  demonstrating  that  the  Notice  was  sent  to  the  attorney  in  error,  the 
attorney  having  timely  paid  the  annual  registration  fee  or  having  timely  filed  the  annual 

registration statement. For purposes of this provision, the date of mailing shall be deemed to be 
the postmark date. 

  

(b)  Within  thirty  days  of  the  expiration  of  the  time  for  an  attorney  to  respond  to  the 
Notice  pursuant  to  Subsection  (a)  hereof,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  submit  to  the 
Court a proposed Suspension Order.  The proposed Suspension Order shall list all attorneys who 
were sent the Notice and who failed to respond; failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Board that they had paid the delinquent annual registration fee or had filed the delinquent annual 
registration  statement,  and  had  paid  the  One  Hundred  Dollar  ($100.00)  delinquent  compliance 
fee;  or,  failed  to  demonstrate  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Board  that  the  Notice  had  been  sent  in 
error.   The  proposed  Suspension  Order  shall  provide  that  the  license  to  practice  law  of  each 
attorney listed therein shall be suspended upon the Court’s filing of the Order and that the license 
of  each  attorney  listed  therein  shall  remain  suspended  until  the  attorney  pays  the  delinquent 
annual  registration  fee  or  files  the  delinquent  annual  registration  statement,  and  pays  the  One 
Hundred  Dollar  ($100.00)  delinquent  compliance  fee  and  a  separate  reinstatement  fee  of  Two 
Hundred Dollars ($200.00), and is reinstated pursuant to Subsection (d). 

  

(c) Upon the Court’s review and approval of the proposed Suspension Order, the Court 
will file the Order summarily suspending the license to practice law of each attorney listed in the 
Order. The suspension  shall remain in  effect until  the  attorney pays the  delinquent  registration 
fees  or  files  the  delinquent  registration  statement,  and  pays  the  One  Hundred  Dollar  ($100.00) 
delinquent  compliance  fee  and  the  Two  Hundred  Dollar  ($200.00)  reinstatement  fee,  and  until 
the  attorney  is  reinstated  pursuant  to  Subsection  (d).  An  attorney  who  fails  to  resolve  the 
suspension within thirty days of the Court’s filing of the Suspension Order shall comply with the 
requirements of Section 28. 

  

(d)  Reinstatement  following  a  suspension  pursuant  to  Subsection  (c)  shall  require  an 
order  of  the  Court  but  shall  not  require  a  reinstatement  proceeding  pursuant  to  Section  30.4, 
unless ordered by the Court.   

  

(1)  An  attorney  suspended  by  the  Court  pursuant  to  Subsection  (c)  who  wishes  to  be 
reinstated and who has remained suspended for one year or less before the filing of a petition for 
reinstatement  shall  file  with  the  Board  a  petition  for  reinstatement  of  the  attorney’s  license  to 
practice  law  demonstrating  that  the  attorney  has  paid  all  delinquent  annual  registration  fees  or 
has filed the delinquent registration statement, and has paid the One Hundred Dollar ($100.00) 
delinquent  compliance  fee  and  the  Two  Hundred  Dollar  ($200.00)  reinstatement  fee;  or, 
alternatively, demonstrating that the Suspension Order was entered in error as to the attorney. If 
the petition is satisfactory to the Board and if the attorney otherwise is eligible for reinstatement, 
the Board, or the Chief Disciplinary  Counsel  acting on its behalf, shall promptly submit to the 
Court a proposed Reinstatement Order. The proposed Reinstatement Order shall provide that the 
attorney’s  reinstatement  is  effective  as  of  the  date  of  the  attorney’s  payment  of  all  delinquent 
registration fees or the date of the attorney’s filing of the delinquent registration statement, and 
the attorney’s payment of the One Hundred Dollar ($100.00) delinquent compliance fee and the 
Two Hundred Dollar ($200.00) reinstatement fee; or, alternatively, as of the date of entry of the 
Suspension Order if that Order was  entered in error.  An attorney resolves a suspension within 

thirty days for purposes of Section 10.6(c) if a proposed Reinstatement Order has been submitted 
to the Court within thirty days of the Court’s filing of the Suspension Order.  

  

(2)  An  attorney  suspended  by  the  Court  pursuant  to  Subsection  (c)  who  wishes  to  be 
reinstated and who has remained suspended for more than one year before the filing of a petition 
for reinstatement shall file with the Court a petition for reinstatement of the attorney’s license to 
practice  law  demonstrating  that  the  attorney  has  paid  all  delinquent  annual  registration  fees  or 
has filed the delinquent registration statement, and has paid the One Hundred Dollar ($100.00) 
delinquent  compliance  fee  and  the  Two  Hundred  Dollar  ($200.00)  reinstatement  fee;  or, 
alternatively,  demonstrating  that  the  Suspension  Order  was  entered  in  error  as  to  the 
attorney.  The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition upon Disciplinary Counsel, who shall 
investigate  the  matter  and  file  an  answer  to  the  petition  within  thirty  days.   The  Court  shall 
review the record and determine whether to grant or deny the petition for reinstatement.  If the 
Court grants the petition, the Reinstatement Order shall provide that the attorney’s reinstatement 
is effective as of the date of the attorney’s payment of all delinquent registration fees or the date 
of the attorney’s filing of the delinquent registration statement, and the attorney’s payment of the 
One  Hundred  Dollar  ($100.00)  delinquent  compliance  fee  and  the  Two  Hundred  Dollar 
($200.00) reinstatement fee; or, alternatively, as of the date of entry of the Suspension Order if 
that Order was entered in error. 

10.7.   (a)  An  attorney  who  claims  an  exemption  under  Section  10.3  (a),  (b),  (d),  or  (e) 
shall file with the Board an application to assume inactive status and discontinue the practice of 
law in this state.  In support of the application, the attorney shall file an affidavit or declaration 
under  penalty  of  perjury  stating  that  the  attorney  is  not  delinquent  in  paying  the  privilege  tax 
imposed on attorneys by Tenn. Code Ann. § 67-4-1702, is not delinquent in meeting any of the 
reporting requirements imposed by Rules 9, 21, and 43, is not delinquent in the payment of any 
fees  imposed  by  those  rules,  and  is  not  delinquent  in  meeting  the  continuing  legal  education 
requirements  imposed  by  Rule  21.   The  Board  shall  approve  the  application  if  the  attorney 
qualifies to assume inactive status under Section 10.3 and is not delinquent in meeting any of the 
obligations  set  out  in  the  preceding  sentence.   If  it  appears  to  the  Board  that  the  applicant  is 
delinquent  in  meeting  any  of  those  obligations,  the  Board  shall  notify  the  applicant  of  the 
delinquency  and  shall  deny  the  application  unless,  within  ninety  days  after  the  date  of  the 
Board’s  notice,  the  applicant  demonstrates  to  the  Board’s  satisfaction  that  the  delinquency  has 
been  resolved.   Upon  the  date  of  the  Board’s  written  approval  of  the  application,  the  attorney 
shall  no  longer  be  eligible  to  practice  law  in  Tennessee.   The  Board  shall  act  promptly  on 
applications  to  assume  inactive  status  and  shall  notify  the  applicant  in  writing  of  the  Board’s 
action.   If the Board denies  an application to  assume inactive status, the applicant  may  request 
the Court’s administrative review by filing in the Nashville office of the  Clerk of the Supreme 
Court a Petition for Review within thirty days of the Board’s denial.  The Court’s review, if any, 
shall  be  conducted  on  the  application,  the  supporting  affidavit  or  declaration  under  penalty  of 
perjury, and any other materials relied upon by the Board in reaching its decision. 

  

(b)  An  attorney  who  assumes  inactive  status  under  an  exemption  granted  by  Section 
10.3(a), (d), or (e) shall pay to the Board, on or before the first day of the attorney’s birth month, 
an annual inactive-status fee in an amount equal to one half of the total annual fee set  forth in 
Section 10.2(c)  for each year the attorney remains inactive.  Inactive attorneys who fail to timely 

pay  the  annual  inactive  fee  and  submit  the  registration  form  prescribed  by  the  Board  will  be 
mailed a Delinquency Notice and will be subject to delinquent compliance fees and suspension 
as provided in Sections 10.5 and 10.6.  

  

(c) An attorney who assumes inactive status under the exemption granted by Section 10.3 
(e) and who is licensed to practice law in another jurisdiction shall not be eligible to provide any 
legal services in Tennessee pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 5.5(c) or (d). 

10.8.  (a) Upon the Board’s written approval of an application to assume inactive status, 
the  attorney  shall  be  removed  from  the  roll  of  those  classified  as  active  until  and  unless  the 
attorney requests and is granted reinstatement to the active rolls. 

 (b)  Reinstatement  following  inactive  status,  other  than  reinstatement  from  disability 
inactive  status  pursuant  to  Section  27.7,  which  has  continued  for  five  years  or  less  before  the 
filing of a petition for reinstatement to active status shall not require an order of the Court or a 
reinstatement  proceeding  pursuant  to  Section  30.4.   The  attorney  shall  file  with  the  Board  a 
petition for reinstatement to active status.  Reinstatement shall be granted unless the attorney is 
subject to an outstanding order of suspension or disbarment, upon the payment of any assessment 
in effect for the year the request is made and any arrears accumulated prior to transfer to inactive 
status.  

 

(c)  Reinstatement  following  inactive  status,  other  than  reinstatement  from  disability 
inactive status pursuant to Section 27.7, which has continued for more than five years before the 
filing of a petition for reinstatement to active status shall require an order of the Court but shall 
not  require  a  reinstatement  proceeding  pursuant  to  Section  30.4,  unless  ordered  by  the 
Court.   The  attorney  shall  file  with  the  Court  a  petition  for  reinstatement  to  active  status.  The 
petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition upon Disciplinary Counsel, who shall investigate the 
matter and file  an answer  to  the petition within thirty days.  The Court shall review  the  record 
and  determine  whether  to  grant  or  deny  the  petition  for  reinstatement.   If  the  Court  grants  the 
petition, the Reinstatement Order shall provide that the attorney’s reinstatement is effective as of 
the date of the attorney’s payment of any assessment in effect for the  year the request is made 
and any arrears accumulated prior to transfer to inactive status. 

10.9. The  courts  of  this  State  are  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  insuring  that  no 
disbarred, suspended, or inactive attorney be permitted to file any document, paper or pleading 
or otherwise practice therein. 

10.10. (a)  Every  attorney  who  is  required  by  Section  10.1  to  file  an  annual  registration 
statement with the Board is requested to also file a pro bono reporting statement, reporting the 
extent of the attorney’s pro bono legal services and activities during the previous calendar year. 
The pro bono reporting statement shall be in substantially the format provided in  Appendix A 
hereto, and shall be provided to the attorney by the Board with the attorney’s annual registration 
statement. 

  

(b)  In  reporting  the  extent  of  the  attorney’s  pro  bono  legal  services  and  activities,  the 
attorney  is  requested  to  state  whether  or  not  the  attorney  made  any  voluntary  financial 

contributions pursuant to RPC 6.1(c), but the attorney need not disclose the amount of any such 
contributions. 

  

(c) The Board may promulgate such forms, policies and procedures as may be necessary 

to implement this Section. 

  

(d) The individual information provided by attorneys in the pro bono reporting statements 
filed  pursuant  to  this  Section  shall  be  confidential  and  shall  not  be  a  public  record,  unless  the 
attorney waives confidentiality on the reporting statement solely to be considered for recognition 
by  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  for  pro  bono  work  the  attorney  completed  in  the  previous 
calendar  year.   The  Board  shall  not  release  any  individual  information  contained  in  such 
statements, except as directed in writing by the Court or as required by law. The Board, however, 
may  compile  statistical  data  derived  from  the  statements,  which  data  shall  not  identify  any 
individual attorney, and may release any such compilations to the public.

2015 
Pro Bono Report 

The 2015 Tennessee Pro Bono Report 

Introduction 

The  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  declared  access  to  justice  its  number  one  strategic 
priority in 2008, thereby launching its Access to Justice Initiative.  The Court appointed 
an  Access  to  Justice  Commission  and  made  the  Commission  responsible  for 
developing  a  strategic  plan  for  educating  the  public  about  the  legal  needs  crisis, 
identifying  priorities  for  improving  access  to  justice,  and  recommending  projects  and 
programs to enhance access to justice.   

Beginning  in  2011,  the  Commission  decided  to  compile  pro  bono  work  that  aids  low-
income  Tennesseans  on  an  annual  basis.    Tennesseans  have  responded  to  the  civil 
legal needs gap by donating time, talent, and treasure to pro bono services,  programs, 
and projects.  

This report highlights 2015 pro bono initiatives according to the following parameters: 

 The 2015 Tennessee Pro Bono Report contains information and statistics on pro
bono  work  done  by  individual  attorneys  in  2014  and  reported  in  2015,  as
voluntarily  submitted  on  the  Tennessee  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility’s
Annual Registration Statement required by active attorneys on or before the first
day of the attorney’s birth month.

 The 2015 Tennessee Pro Bono Report contains information about and statistics
on  pro  bono  activities  of  legal  aid  providers,  bar  associations,  law  schools,
mediation centers, and other organizations regarding work performed in 2015.

“Tennessee  Attorneys”  -  all  attorneys  licensed  to  practice  law  in  Tennessee 
whose primary address is in Tennessee 

“Tennessee  Government  Attorneys”  -  all  attorneys  licensed  to  practice  law  in 
Tennessee and employed by a government agency whose primary address is in 
Tennessee 

“Tennessee  In-House  Counsel”  -  all  attorneys  licensed  to  practice  law  in 
Tennessee,  employed  as  in-house  counsel  and  whose  primary  address  is  in 
Tennessee 
 

Pursuant  to  the  Access  to  Justice  Commission’s  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Access  to 
Justice  Commission  is  focused  on  pro  bono  work  that  aids  low-income  Tennesseans. 
The 2015 statistics reflect pro bono work performed by attorneys in 2014 and reported 
during the 2015 annual registration period.  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 8, Section 
6.1, the 2015 reporting form asked for feedback from attorneys in four categories of pro 
bono service: 
 

●  Legal  services  without  a  fee  or  at  a  substantially  reduced  fee  to  persons  of 

limited means; 

means; 

  Legal services without a fee to non-profit organizations serving persons of limited 

  Legal  services  to  groups  and  organizations  at  a  reduced  fee  when  payment  of 

standard fees would create a financial hardship; and 

  Legal services to improve the law, the legal system, or the legal profession. 

Attorney Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Statistics 

Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 9, Section 10, every attorney who is required to file an 
Annual Registration Statement with the Board of Professional Responsibility (“BPR”)  is 
requested  to  voluntarily  file  a  statement  reporting  the  attorney’s  pro  bono  service  and 
activity during the last calendar year. The first Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form was 
included  in  the  2010  BPR  Registration  Statement  and  reported  data  for  the  2009 
calendar year. 

The Tennessee Supreme Court approved a change in BPR Registration procedures to 
require  renewals  on  the  first  day  of  each  attorney’s  birth  month.  Under  this  new 
procedure, pro bono reporting data for the previous calendar year is not available until 
all  reporting  for  that  calendar  year  has  been  received.  The  Access  to  Justice

Legal Service Providers – Legal Services Corporation (“LSC”)-Funded 

In  Tennessee,  there  are  four  legal  aid  providers  that  receive  federal  funding  from 
the  Legal  Services  Corporation  (“LSC”):  Legal  Aid  of  East  Tennessee,  Legal  Aid 
Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands, Memphis Area Legal Services, 
and  West  Tennessee  Legal  Services.  The  Access  to  Justice  Commission  Chair 
holds  quarterly  conference  calls  with  the  executive  directors  to  discuss  how  the 
Access  to  Justice  Commission  and  the  LSC-funded  legal  aid  providers  can 
collaborate to increase pro bono assistance provided by Tennessee attorneys. 

Below are highlights gathered from the LSC-Funded Providers on 2015 projects: 

  Legal  Aid  of  East  Tennessee  (LAET):  LAET’s  Chattanooga  office  reported 

266 pro bono volunteer attorneys provided assistance in 2015. 
 

o  The Chattanooga office of Legal Aid of East Tennessee expanded pro 
bono advice clinics in Bradley County, in partnership with the Bradley 
County Bar Association, and began targeted efforts to increase will-
writing and brief services clinics, such as planning clinics to write wills 
for Habitat for Humanity homeowners. 

  Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands (LASMTC):  

LASMTC is the  largest  LSC-funded  organization  in Tennessee.   It provided 
pro bono assistance to 2,530 clients in 2015.   
 

o 

In 2015, the Volunteer Lawyers Program undertook a partnership with 
Metro  Nashville  Public  Schools  to  provide  free  legal  help  to  families 
with children. 

 

 

o  LASMTC  Low 

is  supported  by  a 
comprehensive  approach  from  approximately  80  attorneys,  enrolled 
agents, certified public accounts, and volunteer tax preparers. 

Income  Taxpayer  Clinic 

  Memphis  Area  Legal  Services  (MALS):    MALS  reports  324  pro  bono 
volunteers served 1,319 clients through pro bono programs in  2015.  MALS 
hosts six recurring legal clinics each month. 

 

o  MALS is working to establish a legal clinic with a local church through 
Tennessee Supreme Court’s Access to Justice Faith-Based Initiative.   

  West  Tennessee  Legal  Services  (WTLS):  WTLS  reports  serving  99  clients 

through pro bono programs in 2015. 
 

o  WTLS  organizes  a  monthly  free  legal  clinic  at  a  local  food  bank.    In 
2015,  WTLS  also  offered  a  free  legal  clinic  at  a  library  in  a  rural 
county.

In addition to the four LSC-funded Tennessee providers, there is an additional LSC-
funded provider that serves Tennessee as well as five other states. 
 

  Southern  Migrant  Legal  Services  (SMLS):  provides  free  legal  services  to 
migrant and seasonal farm workers on employment-related matters.  SMLS 
is  a  project  of  Texas  RioGrande  Legal  Aid,  and  the  Nashville  office  serves 
the  following  states:  Alabama,  Arkansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Mississippi, 
and Tennessee.  SMLS’ staff attorneys served 200 clients in 2015. 

 

Legal Service Providers – Non-LSC-Funded 

In  Tennessee,  there  are  many  legal  service  providers  that  do  not  receive  funding 
from  the  Legal  Services  Corporation.  These  non-LSC-funded  organizations  can 
serve  segments  of  the  population  and  handle  legal  matters  that  LSC-funded 
providers  cannot.  Non-LSC-funded  organizations  do  not  have  to  follow  federal 
income guidelines to determine if a person is eligible to receive legal services.  

The Commission has gathered data from the following Non-LSC-Funded Providers 
and included pro bono successes below.  

  Southeast  Tennessee  Legal  Services:    Currently  funded  to  focus  on 
domestic violence and some consumer issues and handle pro bono matters 
on an as-needed basis.   
 

o  The  primary  pro  bono  project  is  Friends  of  the  Court  in  Bradley 
County.  A “Friend of the Court” attorney does not provide legal advice 
to  litigants.  Instead,  the  attorney’s  function  is  to  help  the  court’s 
administration of these hearings by discussing with the litigants in the 
courtroom,  before  they  appear before  the  judge,  whether or not  they 
can  agree  as  to  the  need  to  continue  the  restraints,  or  the  desire  to 
dismiss them.  
 

  Tennessee  Justice  for  Our  Neighbors:  had  approximately  150  pro  bono 

attorneys who provided assistance to 300 clients. 

  Tennessee  Alliance  for  Legal  Services  (TALS):  provided  help  to  a  total  of 
6,477 Tennessee citizens, including 2,614 via OnlineTNJustice and 3,863 via 
1-844-HELP4TN phone helpline. TALS and the Tennessee Bar Association, 
with  support  from  the  Tennessee  ATJ  Commission,  have  developed  an 
online  legal  resource  that  allows  those  who  qualify  to  email  their  legal 
questions to a central website. (www.OnlineTNJustice.org). These questions 
are  then  answered  by  volunteer  attorneys.  This  pro  bono  service  allows 
citizens,  especially  in  rural  parts  of  the  state,  to  receive  convenient 
assistance for free. 
 

o  For  2015,  volunteer attorneys  reported 897.80  pro  bono  hours which 

equates to 179.56 credit hours for CLE purposes.

registered with the site since it launched. 
 

  Of the 488 who have actively registered, 301 have answered at

In  its  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Access  to  Justice  Commission  acknowledged  the 
importance of introducing pro bono services to future attorneys while they are still in 
law  school.  The  Access  to  Justice  Commission  committed  to  convening  meetings 
with law school Deans, law school pro bono directors and faculty, and law students 
at least annually to increase the participation of law students in pro bono activities 
and  discuss  issues  specific  to  pro  bono  work  done  by  law  students.  The  meeting 
was held at the Nashville School of Law in October 2015.   

t  the  2014  Law  School  Pro  Bono  Summit,  the  OnlineTNJustice  virtual  clinic 
program  was  introduced.  By  summer  2015,  all  six  Tennessee  law  schools 
participated in at least one clinic.  A virtual legal advice clinic is similar to a regular 
legal clinic,  but  instead  of  clients  traveling  to  a  destination  to  ask  for legal advice, 
the  client asks  over the  internet.    Students  get  to  network with  attorneys  and  take 
on genuine issues under the supervision of a licensed Tennessee attorney. 

o  date,  five  law  schools  have  submitted  responses  to  the  survey  and  highlights

n  Tennessee,  there  are  non-profit  mediation  centers  that  provide  pro  bono 
mediation services to low-income residents across the state, known as Community 
Mediation  Centers,  as  well  as  individuals  who  serve  as  Supreme  Court  Rule  31 
Mediators.   

he AOC administers two state-funded grants related to mediation. The first is the 
Victim  Offender  Mediation  Program  (VORP).  The  Tennessee  General  Assembly 
established  VORP  in  1993  to  provide  funding  support  for  the  state's  earliest  non-
profit mediation centers.  The second is the Parent Education and Mediation Fund 
(PEMF) established pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 38 and T.C.A. §6-6-413.  The 
AOC  distributes  these  funds  to  grantees  to  provide  education  and  mediation  for 
indigent  parents  involved  in  absolute  divorce,  legal  separation,  annulment,  or 
separate maintenance proceedings, and any other custody matters.   

he  Access  to  Justice  and  Pro  Bono  Coordinators  surveyed  current  VORP  and 

PEMF grantees to obtain additional information on their pro bono efforts in 2015.   

  Community  Mediation  Centers  (CMCs):    CMCs  partner  with  local  courts  to 
provide  a  range  of  free  or  low-cost  (sliding  scale)  mediations  to  those  who 
are most vulnerable in the court system  - namely, self-represented litigants.  
The  AOC  supports  these  centers  through  limited  grant  funding  designed  to 
increase low-income Tennesseans' access to mediation services.   

o  date,  the  following  mediation  center  providers  have  responded  to  the 
survey:  Community  Mediation  Center;  Community  Reconciliation,  Inc.;  First 
Judicial District Court Clinic; Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County; 
Mid-South  Mediation  Services;  and  Nashville  Conflict  Resolution  Center.  
These  agencies  reported  serving  approximately  3,700  clients  through 
mediation  in  2015.    Over  80.00%  of  these  clients  were  served  through 
volunteer mediators.

  Supreme Court Rule 31 Mediator Pro Bono:  This is a system where litigants, 

courts, and attorneys can locate qualified alternative dispute resolution 
mediators and other neutrals and enlist their assistance in resolving matters 
pending before courts of record.  The Rule provides required credentials and 
training for mediators who wish to be listed as a Supreme Court Rule 31 
Mediator.  Rule 31 Mediators are required to file a report after each 
mediation.  The below comes from the reports filed by Rule 31 Mediators. 
 

o  For  purposes  of  this  report,  Court-Ordered  Pro  Bono,  Pro  Bono, 
Reduced  Fee,  and  Supreme  Court  Rule  38  Fee  Types  will  be 
considered “Pro Bono”. 
 

o  Supreme Court Rule 38 sets forth the qualifications and processes for 
the  appointment,  compensation,  and  payment  of  the  reasonable 
expenses  of  alternative  dispute  resolution  neutrals  and  education 
providers  serving  indigent  parents  involved  in  absolute  divorce,  legal 
separation,  annulment,  or  separate  maintenance  proceedings,  and 
any other custody matters.  It provides for the distribution of moneys

Recognition 
 

Thanks  to  the  generosity  of  so  many,  Access  to  Justice  has  become  a  reality  for 
many low-income Tennesseans and the following have received recognition. 

 

In  2015,  the  Supreme  Court  recognized  377  attorneys  as  Attorneys  for 
Justice. Each attorney provided 50 or more hours of pro bono service in the 
2014 calendar year.   

o  The  attorneys  who  were  recognized  reported  a  total  of  over  53,700 

hours of pro bono service provided during 2014. 
 

o  Thirty-six attorneys each reported providing 300 hours or more hours 

of pro bono service in the 2014 calendar year. 

  Two  law  firms  submitted  an  application  for  recognition  directly  to  the  AOC 
and were recognized as Attorneys for Justice for pro bono work done by their 
attorneys.  These  offices  provided  an  average  of  50  or  more  hours  per 
attorney during the 2014 calendar year. 

 

In 2015, 117 Law Students for Justice were recognized for performing 50 or 
more  hours  of  pro  bono  legal  work  over  the  course  of  their  law  school 
careers. 

his pro bono report demonstrates the variety of pro bono initiatives and documents 
the great work of our access to justice partners.  The Commission urges attorneys 
to continue to track and report the many activities in which they have provided pro 
bono representation or services per Supreme Court Rule 8, Section 6.1.   
 

Conclusion 
 

Tennessee attorneys reported 568,170 hours of pro bono legal services in 
Reporting Year 2015.  Using a standard hourly rate of $200.00, the value of these 
services is estimated to be $113,634,000.   

he Tennessee Supreme Court Access to Justice Commission is proud to highlight 

the extensive pro bono efforts of organizations, attorneys, and law students in this 
annual report.

CHAPTER 6 

PUBLIC SERVICE 

RULE 6.1: PRO BONO PUBLICO SERVICE 

A lawyer should aspire to render at least 50 hours of pro bono publico legal services per 

year. In fulfilling this responsibility, the lawyer should: 

(a) provide a substantial portion of such services without fee or expectation of fee to: 

(1) persons of limited means; or 
(2)  charitable,  religious,  civic,  community,  governmental,  and  educational 
organizations  in  matters  that  are  designed  primarily  to  address  the  needs  of 
persons of limited means; and 
(b) provide any additional services through: 

(1)  delivery  of  legal  services  at  no  fee  or  at  a  substantially  reduced  fee  to 
individuals, groups, or organizations seeking to secure or protect civil rights, civil 
liberties, or public rights, or charitable religious, civic, community, governmental, 
and  educational  organizations  in  matters  in  furtherance  of  their  organizational 
purposes,  where  the  payment  of  standard  legal  fees  would  significantly  deplete 
the organization's economic resources or would be otherwise inappropriate; 
(2) delivery of legal services at a substantially reduced  fee to persons of limited 
means; or 
(3) participation in activities for improving the law, the legal system, or the legal 
profession. 

(c) In addition to providing pro bono publico legal services, a lawyer should voluntarily 
contribute  financial  support  to  organizations  that  provide  legal  services  to  persons  of 
limited means. 

Comment 

[1]  Every  lawyer,  regardless  of  professional  prominence  or  professional  work  load,  has  a 
responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to pay, and personal involvement in the 
problems  of  the  disadvantaged  can  be  one  of  the  most  rewarding  experiences  in  the  life  of  a 
lawyer.  This  Rule  urges  all  lawyers  to  provide  a  minimum  of  50  hours  of  pro  bono  service 
annually. It is recognized that in some years a lawyer may render greater or fewer hours than the 
annual  standard  specified.  Services  can  be  performed  in  civil  matters  or  in  criminal  or  quasi-
criminal  matters  for  which  there  is  no  government  obligation  to  provide  funds  for  legal 
representation, such as post-conviction death penalty appeals. 

[2] Paragraphs  (a)(1) and (a)(2) recognize the  critical need  for legal services that exists among 
persons of limited means by providing that a substantial majority of the legal services rendered 
annually  to  the  disadvantaged  be  furnished  without  fee  or  expectation  of  fee.  Legal  services 
under  these  paragraphs  consist  of  a  full  range  of  activities,  including  individual  and  class 

representation,  the  provision  of  legal  advice,  legislative  lobbying,  administrative  rule  making, 
and the provision of free training or mentoring to those who represent persons of limited means. 
The variety of these activities should facilitate participation by government lawyers, even when 
restrictions exist on their engaging in the outside practice of law. 

3]  Persons  eligible  for  legal  services  under  paragraphs  (a)(1)  and  (a)(2)  include  those  who 
qualify financially for participation in  programs  funded  by the  Legal Services  Corporation and 
those whose  incomes and financial resources are  slightly  above  the  guidelines  utilized  by such 
programs but, nevertheless, cannot afford counsel. Legal services can be rendered to individuals 
or  to  organizations  such  as  homeless  shelters,  abused  women's  centers,  and  food  pantries  that 
serve those of limited means. The term "governmental organizations" includes, but is not limited 
to, public protection programs and sections of governmental or public sector agencies. 

4] Because service must be provided without fee or expectation of fee, the intent of the lawyer 
to  render  free  legal  services  is  essential  for  the  work  performed  to  fall  within  the  meaning  of 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2). Accordingly, services rendered cannot be considered pro bono if an 
anticipated  fee  is  uncollected,  but  the  award  of  statutory  attorneys'  fees  in  a  case  originally 
accepted  as  pro  bono  would  not  disqualify  such  services  from  inclusion  under  this  paragraph. 
Lawyers who do receive fees in such cases are encouraged to contribute an appropriate portion 
of such fees to organizations or projects that benefit persons of limited means. In some cases, a 
fee paid by the government to an appointed lawyer will be so low relative to what would have 
been a reasonable fee for the amount and quality of work performed – as in post-conviction death 
penalty cases – that the lawyer should be credited for the purpose of this Rule as having rendered 
the services without fee. This would also be the case when a lawyer is appointed as counsel in a 
criminal matter, the fee paid the lawyer is capped at a certain  amount, and the lawyer expends 
significant time working on the case after the capped amount has been exceeded. 

5]  While  it  is  possible  for  a  lawyer  to  fulfill  the  annual  responsibility  to  perform  pro  bono 
services  exclusively  through  activities  described  in  paragraph  (a),  the  commitment  can  also  be 
met  in  a  variety  of  ways  as  set  forth  in  paragraph  (b).  Constitutional,  statutory,  or  regulatory 
restrictions  may  prohibit  or  impede  government  and  public  sector  lawyers  and  judges  from 
performing  the  pro  bono  services  outlined  in  paragraphs  (a),  (b)(1),  and  (b)(2).  Accordingly, 
where those restrictions apply, government and public sector lawyers and judges may fulfill their 
pro bono responsibility by performing services outlined in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c). 

6]  Paragraph  (b)(1)  includes  the  provision  of  certain  types  of  legal  services  to  those  whose 
incomes  and  financial  resources  place  them  above  limited  means.  It  also  permits  the  pro  bono 
lawyer  to  accept  a  substantially  reduced  fee  for  services.  Examples  of  the  types  of  issues  that 
may be addressed under this  paragraph include First Amendment claims, Title VII claims, and 
environmental  protection  claims.  Additionally,  a  wide  range  of  organizations  may  be 
represented, including social service, medical research, cultural, and religious groups. 

7]  Paragraph  (b)(2)  covers  instances  in  which  lawyers  agree  to  and  receive  a  modest  fee  for 
furnishing  legal  services  to  persons  of  limited  means.  Participation  in  judicare  programs  and 
acceptance of court appointments in which the fee is substantially below a lawyer's usual rate are 
encouraged under this paragraph.

8] Paragraph (b)(3) recognizes the value of lawyers engaging in activities that improve the law, 
the legal system, or the legal profession. A few examples of the many activities that fall within 
this paragraph are serving on bar association committees; serving on boards of pro bono or legal 
services  programs;  taking  part  in  Law  Day  activities;  acting  as  a  continuing  legal  education 
instructor; serving as a mediator or an arbitrator; and engaging in legislative lobbying to improve 
the law, the legal system, or the profession. 

9] Because the provision of pro bono services is a professional responsibility, it is the individual 
ethical commitment of each lawyer. Nevertheless, there may be times when it is not feasible for a 
lawyer  to  engage  in  pro  bono  services.  At  such  times  a  lawyer  may  discharge  the  pro  bono 
responsibility  by  providing  financial  support  to  organizations  providing  free  legal  services  to 
persons of limited means. Such financial support should be reasonably equivalent to the value of 
the  hours  of  service  that  would  have  otherwise  been  provided.  In  addition,  at  times  it  may  be 
more  feasible  to  satisfy  the  pro  bono  responsibility  collectively,  as  by  a  firm's  aggregate  pro 
bono activities. 

10]  Because  the  efforts  of  individual  lawyers  are  not  enough  to  meet  the  need  for  free  legal 
services  that  exists  among  persons  of  limited  means,  the  government  and  the  profession  have 
instituted additional programs to provide those services. Every lawyer should financially support 
such  programs,  in  addition  to  either  providing  direct  pro  bono  services  or  making  financial 
contributions when pro bono service is not feasible. 

11] Law firms should act reasonably to enable and encourage all lawyers in the firm to provide 
the pro bono legal services called for by this Rule. 

12] Because this Rule states an aspiration rather than a mandatory ethical duty, it is not intended 
to be enforced through disciplinary process.
