      <pre>IN THE SUPREME COURT OF TENNESSEE
AT NASHVILLE

IN RE: AMENDMENT OF RULE 6, RULES OF THE TENNESSEE 
SUPREME COURT

No. ADM2018-713

ORDER

On April 18, 2018, this Court entered an order adopting the Uniform Bar Examination 
and amending the relevant sections of Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 7. In addition, the 
Court stated that it would consider “whether to adopt a post-admission law component and 
the content of such a requirement.” To that end, proposed revisions to Tennessee Supreme 
Court Rule 6, which are attached to this order, would require new attorneys to complete a 
Tennessee Law Course within one year of admission to the Tennessee bar. The Tennessee 
Law Course would be administered by the Administrative Office of the Court and include, 
but not be limited to, instruction on areas of Tennessee civil and criminal procedure, real 
estate, wills, estates and trusts, business organizations, family law, and administrative law.

The Court hereby solicits written comments from judges, lawyers, bar associations, 
members of the public, and any other interested parties with respect to the attached proposed 
revisions to Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 6. The deadline for submitting written comments 
is Monday, June 18, 2018. Comments should reference the docket number set out above and 
should be e-mailed to appellatecourtclerk@tncourts.gov or mailed to:

James M. Hivner, Clerk
Re: Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 6
Tennessee Appellate Courts
100 Supreme Court Building

Nashville, TN 37219-1407

The Clerk shall provide a copy of this order, including the attachment, to LexisNexis and to

include, but not be limited to, instruction on areas of Tennessee civil and criminal procedure, real estate, 
wills, estates and trusts, business organizations, family law, and administrative law.   

C. The fee for the Tennessee Law Course shall be set as part of the Schedule of Fees promulgated by the 
Board of Law Examiners pursuant to Rule 7, section 11.01 and collected by the Administrative Office of 
the Courts. 

D. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall supply the Commission on Continuing Legal Education 
(the  “Commission”)  a  Certificate  of  Compliance  upon  an  attorney’s  completion  of  the  Tennessee  Law 
Course.  

E. The Tennessee Law Course is a post-admission requirement and not continuing legal education, and 
no fee pursuant to Rule 21, section 8.02 shall be imposed on the provider of the Tennessee Law Course.  

F. Any attorney who fails to complete the Tennessee Law Course within one year of admission shall be 
subject to the following: 

1.  The  Commission  shall  issue  a  Notice  of  Non-Compliance  to  any  attorney  who  has  not 
completed  the  Tennessee  Law  Course  within  one  year  of  admission.  The  Notice  of  Non-
Compliance  shall  require  the  attorney  to  remedy  the  deficiency  by  completing  the  Tennessee 
Law Course within sixty days of the date of the Notice of Non-Compliance. 

2.   Each  attorney  who  does  not  complete  the  Tennessee  Law  Course  within  one  year  of 
admission shall be assessed an Initial Non-Compliance Fee of One Hundred Dollars ($100) upon 
issuance of the Notice of Non-Compliance. The Initial Non-Compliance Fee shall be paid within 
sixty  days  of  the  date  of  the  Notice  of  Non-Compliance  unless  the  attorney  shows  to  the 
satisfaction of the Executive Director of the Commission that the Notice of Non-Compliance was 
erroneously issued, in which case no Initial Non-Compliance Fee shall be due. 

.   Each  attorney  to  whom  a  Notice  of  Non-Compliance  is  issued  shall  file  an  Affidavit  of 
Compliance with the Commission within sixty days of the date of the Notice of Non-Compliance  
showing that the attorney has completed the Tennessee Law Course. 

  3

 

 

4. In the event an attorney fails to complete the Tennessee Law Course within sixty days of the 
date the  Notice  of Non-Compliance  was  issued, timely  file  the Affidavit of Compliance,  or pay 
the Initial Non-Compliance Fee assessed pursuant to paragraph 2 above, the attorney shall pay 
to the Commission an additional Continuing Non-Compliance Fee of Two Hundred Dollar ($200). 

.  For  any  attorney  against  whom  a  Continuing  Non-Compliance  Fee  is  assessed  pursuant  to 
paragraph 4 above, the Commission shall prepare a draft Suspension Order. A copy of the draft 
Suspension  Order  shall  be  provided  to  the  Supreme  Court  for  informational  purposes  and 
mailed to the attorney by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to  the address 
of record on the most recent registration statement filed by the attorney pursuant to Supreme 
Court Rule 9, Section 10.1 or other last known address.  

. No later than thirty days after the draft Suspension Order is issued and mailed, the attorney 
listed in the draft Suspension Order may file an Affidavit of Compliance in a form acceptable to 
the Commission showing that the attorney has completed the Tennessee Law Course and paid 
the  Initial  and  Continuing  Non-Compliance  fees.  Upon  the  Commission’s  approval  of  the 
Affidavit  of  Compliance  and  upon  the  attorney’s  payment  of  all  outstanding  fees,  the 
Commission shall remove the attorney’s name from the draft Suspension Order. 

. In the event the attorney fails to complete the Tennessee Law Course or pay the required fees 
within 30 days after the issuance of the draft Suspension Order, the Commission shall submit to 
the Supreme Court a final Suspension Order listing the attorney(s) who failed to comply with the 
requirements  of  this  Rule.  At  the  same  time,  the  Commission  shall  notify  the  Board  of 
Professional  Responsibility  of  the  names  of  the  licensed  attorneys  who  have  retired,  taken 
inactive  status,  been  suspended,  or  whose  license  to  practice  law  in  this  state  is  otherwise 
inactive, and who failed to comply with the requirements of this Rule. The Supreme Court will 
review  the  final  Suspension  Order  and,  upon  the  Court’s  approval,  shall  enter  the  Suspension 
Order suspending the law license of each attorney listed in the order. The Board of Professional 
Responsibility  shall  not  reactivate  the  license  of  any  attorney  whose  license  is  suspended 
pursuant  to  this  Rule  until  the  Commission  certifies  that  the  attorney  has  completed  the 
Tennessee Law Course and has paid all fees. 

8. Each attorney named in the final Suspension Order entered by the Court or whose name is 
submitted to the Board of Professional Responsibility as ineligible for reactivation for failure to 
meet the  requirements of this  Rule shall pay  to the Commission a Five  Hundred Dollar ($500) 
Suspension  Fee  as  a  condition  of  reinstatement of  his  or  her  law  license.  The  Suspension  Fee 
shall be paid in addition to both the Initial Non-Compliance Fee ($100) and the Continuing Non-
Compliance Fee ($200). 

9. Payment of all fees  imposed in this section shall be  a requirement for compliance  with this 
Rule.
