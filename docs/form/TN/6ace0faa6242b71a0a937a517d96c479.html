OPINION

I.

FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY

In November 2016, Ms. Kathy A. Leslie contacted an acquaintance, Ms. Linda Gail 
Compton, for the purpose of inducing her to loan Ms. Leslie money for the purchase of 
property located in  Nashville  (“the  Property”).   Ms.  Leslie  represented  to  Ms.  Compton 
that she was in the process of putting together an investment package for the purpose of 
purchasing  the  Property.    On  November  22,  2016,  the  parties  entered  into  a  written 
agreement (“Agreement 1”), in which Ms. Compton agreed to loan $100,000 to Ms. Leslie. 
Agreement 1 included an arbitration clause. Agreement 1 also provided that Ms. Leslie 
would repay Ms. Compton $130,000, which included 30% interest, on the maturity date of 
January 31, 2018.  Ms. Compton made the loan and alleges that Ms. Leslie’s obligation 

03/21/2023matured and remains unpaid.  The purpose of this loan was not set forth in Agreement 1, 
but  Ms.  Compton  maintains  that  it  was  for  the  purchase  of  the  Property based  on  the 
representations made to her by Ms. Leslie.

On  January  19,  2017,  Mr.  Brad  Crawford,  who  is  Ms.  Compton’s  now-deceased 
son, also entered into a written agreement (“Agreement 2”) with Ms. Leslie, in which Mr. 
Crawford agreed to loan $100,000 to Ms. Leslie in two installments.  Agreement 2 also 
included  an  arbitration  clause. After  Mr.  Crawford  advanced  the  first  installment,  he 
assigned  Agreement  2  to  Ms.  Compton.  Ms.  Compton  then  advanced  the  second 
installment.  Agreement 2 provided that Ms. Leslie would pay 30% interest on the principal 
and would make four principal payments with the final one due on June 1, 2021.  However, 
Ms. Compton alleges that those periodic payments were not paid and that the obligation 
remains unpaid.  Like Agreement 1, the purpose of this loan was not set forth in Agreement 
2, but Ms. Compton  maintains that it was for the purchase of the Property based on the 
representations made to her by Ms. Leslie.

On May 4, 2017, the parties entered into another written agreement (“Agreement 
3”),  in  which  Ms.  Compton  agreed  to  loan $50,000  to  Ms.  Leslie.  Like  the  first  two 
agreements, Agreement 3 included an arbitration clause.  Agreement 3 provided that Ms. 
Leslie would pay 33% interest on the principal and would make periodic payments on the 
obligation.  Ms. Compton made the loan and alleges that Ms. Leslie’s obligation remains 
unpaid.  Again, the purpose of this loan was not set forth in Agreement 3.

Ms. Leslie continued to represent to Ms. Compton that she needed more funds to 
purchase the Property.  As such, Ms. Compton made four additional loans to Ms. Leslie by 
writing  checks  to  her:  $15,000  on  August  9,  2017;  $15,000  on  September  17,  2017; 
$10,000 on October 15, 2017; and $10,000 on April 10, 2018.  Ms. Compton maintains 
that  these  four  loans  were  made  for  the  purchase  of  the  Property  based  on  Ms.  Leslie’s 
representations.    She  alleges  that  these  obligations remain  unpaid  despite  her  demands. 
Upon default of these obligations, Ms. Compton inquired into whether the Property had 
ever been purchased.  She discovered that the Property had been purchased by Penthouse 
Hospitality Group, Inc. (“Penthouse”), of which Ms. Leslie was the sole shareholder.  The 
Property  was  conveyed to  Penthouse  via  warranty  deed  dated January  30,  2017 and 
recorded on February 1, 2017.  She also discovered that the funds she had loaned to Ms. 
Leslie were not used as represented and that the Property was encumbered by a Deed of 
Trust in the amount of $250,000.  The initial filing date with the Tennessee Secretary of 
State for Penthouse was November 30, 2016, which was just days after the parties entered 
into Agreement 1.

In  December  2018,  Ms.  Compton  filed  a  complaint  against  Ms.  Leslie  and 
She  alleged  that  Ms.  Leslie  breached  the 

Penthouse (collectively,  “Defendants”).1

                                           

1 We note here that Ms. Leslie is a licensed attorney in Tennessee.  For much of the proceedings in 

- 2 -

agreements between them and was in default for failure to pay.  She also alleged that Ms. 
Leslie  committed  legal  malpractice  and  an  intentional  misrepresentation  or  a  negligent 
misrepresentation in the alternative.  Additionally, she alleged that Penthouse was the alter 
ego  of  Ms.  Leslie  and  was  formed  for  the  sole  purpose  of  perpetrating  the  intentional 
misrepresentation.  Defendants responded by filing a joint motion to dismiss the complaint. 
They argued that Ms. Compton’s sole and exclusive remedy by virtue of the agreements 
and related financial obligations was through binding arbitration.  Therefore, they argued 
that the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction.  Penthouse also filed a separate 
motion to dismiss the complaint.  It argued that it was not a party to any of the agreements 
at issue.

In September 2019, the trial court entered orders denying both motions.  In its first 
order,  the  court  denied  Defendants’  joint  motion  to  dismiss  finding  that  the  complaint 
alleged fraud and the matter should first proceed to discovery on the allegation of fraud.  
The  court  explained  that  agreements  would  be  abrogated  and  arbitration  would  not  be 
appropriate if the allegation of fraud was proven.  The court noted, however, that the motion 
to dismiss could be refiled at a later date if appropriate.  In its second order, the court denied 
Penthouse’s motion to dismiss finding that the complaint alleged every element of fraud 
that  could  be  associated  with  this  matter.  The  court  explained  that  Ms.  Compton 
sufficiently  alleged  that  Penthouse  was  the  alter  ego  of  Ms.  Leslie  and  that  Ms.  Leslie 
perpetrated a fraud on Ms. Compton and used Penthouse as an instrumentality of that fraud.

In April 2021, Defendants filed a notice of intent and application to proceed under 
the arbitration clauses of the agreements.  The trial court entered an order noting that it was 
in receipt of Defendants’ notice of intent and application to proceed under the arbitration
clauses  of  the  agreements.    The  court  directed  Ms.  Compton  to  file  a  response.  Ms. 
Compton filed a response giving notice that she was not amenable to submitting all of the 
issues to arbitration.  She requested that the trial court not order the parties to arbitration
or, in the alternative, the court order the parties to arbitration only as to the question of Ms. 
Leslie’s liability under the agreements.  In January 2022, the trial court entered an order 
requiring Ms. Leslie to disclose the name of the bank(s) or any financial institution in which 
she deposited the funds received from either Ms. Compton and/or Mr. Crawford, execute 
a release in favor of Ms. Compton authorizing her to obtain bank records, and execute the 
necessary documents to release her tax returns to Ms. Compton.  The court also required 
Ms. Leslie to execute the necessary documents on behalf of Penthouse to release its bank 
records.  Additionally, the court’s order provided in pertinent part as follows:

8. If  the  parties  agree  to  have  all  the  issues  in  the  pleadings  submitted  to 
arbitration, they shall enter into an Agreed Order submitting all issues to 
arbitration.  If the parties do not enter into an Agreed Order submitting 

                                           
the trial court, she represented herself pro se and represented Penthouse as its attorney.

all issues to arbitration, then this Court will enter an Order as to which 
issues will be submitted to arbitration.

9. The arbitration clauses contained in the documents are in full force.
10. Any  money that was advanced pursuant to a written document that has 

the word arbitration in it is subject to arbitration.

Defendants  subsequently  filed  a  motion  to  amend  the  order  or  for  clarification.  They 
sought to amend the trial court’s order by limiting the time period of the bank records from 
November 22, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

In  March  2022,  the  trial  court  entered  an  order  modifying  the  time  period  of  the 
bank records from January 2016 to present.  The court noted that Ms. Leslie should inform 
the court of her decision regarding whether she wanted to transfer this matter to arbitration 
in its entirety or whether she wanted to litigate parts of it in court.  Defendants then filed a 
proposed “Notice of Intent to Arbitrate and Order to Compel Arbitration.”  They proposed 
to have the entire matter transferred to arbitration for final adjudication of all the issues in 
dispute.  The trial court held a conference call with counsel for both parties and explained 
that it would not enter the order to compel arbitration unless the order was approved for 
entry by both parties.  The court suggested that it would enter the order requested by Ms. 
Leslie as long as the order provided that the outstanding discovery orders would remain in 
full force and effect.  However, Ms. Leslie did not agree to add the suggested language. 
She requested that the court enter the proposed “Notice of Intent to Arbitrate and Order to 
Compel Arbitration.”  In the alternative, she requested that the court prepare and enter an 
order in accordance with the court’s order from January 2022.  The trial court ultimately 
entered an order declining to approve for entry the proposed “Notice of Intent to Arbitrate 
and Order to Compel Arbitration.”  Thereafter, Defendants timely filed an appeal.

II.

ISSUES PRESENTED

Defendants present the following issue for review on appeal, which we have slightly 

restated:

1. Whether the trial court erred when it declined to compel arbitration even though the 
parties’  contract  states  that  in  the  event  of  any  disagreement  or  breach  of  the 
agreement, both parties agree to arbitrate and agree that they are giving up their right 
to a court, jury trial, or appeal.

For the following reasons, we dismiss the appeal.

III. DISCUSSION

Ms.  Compton  argues  that  this  Court  lacks  subject  matter  jurisdiction  because  the 
trial  court’s  order  is  not  a  final  order  subject  to  appeal.    “Subject  matter  jurisdiction 
- 4 -

involves  the  court’s  lawful  authority  to  adjudicate  a  controversy  before  it.”    Johnson  v. 
Hopkins, 432 S.W.3d 840, 843 (Tenn. 2013) (citing Chapman v. DaVita, Inc., 380 S.W.3d 
710, 712 (Tenn. 2012); Meighan v. U.S. Sprint Commc’ns Co., 924 S.W.2d 632, 639 (Tenn. 
1996)).  This Court must “consider whether the trial and appellate court have jurisdiction 
over the subject matter, whether or not presented for review . . . .”  Tenn. R. App P. 13(b).  
“Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction over a case is a question of law that we 
review  de  novo  with  no  presumption  of  correctness.”    Morgan  Keegan  &  Co.,  Inc.  v. 
Smythe,  401  S.W.3d  595,  602  (Tenn.  2013)  (citing  Word  v.  Metro  Air  Servs.,  Inc.,  377 
S.W.3d 671, 674 (Tenn. 2012)).

We  observe that  this  appeal  is  not  “interlocutory  in  nature,  i.e.,  a  non-final  order 
appealed pursuant to Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure 9 or 10.”  Regions Bank v. 
Crants, No. M2020-01703-COA-R3-CV, 2021 WL 3910696, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 
1,  2021).    Rather,  Defendants  bring  this  appeal  under  Tennessee  Rule  of  Appellate 
Procedure 3(a), which provides:

In civil actions every final judgment entered by a trial court from which an 
appeal lies to the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals is appealable as of right. 
Except as otherwise permitted in rule 9 and in Rule 54.02 Tennessee Rules 
of  Civil  Procedure,  if  multiple  parties  or  multiple  claims  for  relief  are 
involved in an action, any order that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or 
the  rights  and  liabilities  of  fewer  than  all  the  parties  is  not  enforceable  or 
appealable  and  is  subject  to  revision  at  any  time  before  entry  of  a  final 
judgment adjudicating all the claims, rights, and liabilities of all parties.

Therefore,  pursuant  to  Rule  3(a),  an  appeal  as  of  right  is  only  available  from  a  final 
judgment.    “A  final  judgment  is  one  that  resolves  all  of  the  issues  in  the  case,  ‘leaving 
nothing else for the trial court to do.’”  Regions Bank, 2021 WL 3910696, at *3 (quoting 
State  ex  rel.  McAllister  v.  Goode,  968  S.W.2d  834,  840  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1997)).    “This 
Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal if there is no final 
judgment.”  In re Estate of Schorn, 359 S.W.3d 192, 196 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2011).  However, 
the  Tennessee  Uniform  Arbitration  Act  (“the  TUAA”),  which  is  codified  at  Tennessee 
Code Annotated section 29-5-301 et seq., “creates limited exceptions to this rule.”  T.R. 
Mills Contractors, Inc. v. WRH Enters., LLC, 93 S.W.3d 861, 865 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002).

According to the terms of agreements at issue, the agreements are governed by the 
laws  of  the  State  of  Tennessee,  which  would  be  the  TUAA  in  this  case.  Even  if  the 
agreements  were  governed  by  the  Federal  Arbitration  Act  (“the  FAA”),  9  U.S.C. §  1  et 
seq., we  have  explained  that  the  question  of  whether  this  Court  has  subject  matter 
jurisdiction over this appeal must be determined under the TUAA.2  Regarding appeals, the 

                                           

2 Even where the substantive provisions of the FAA may preempt the TUAA, “it does not preempt 
the procedural provisions of the TUAA for appeals of arbitration orders entered by Tennessee state courts
- 5 -

TUAA provides in pertinent as follows:

(a) An appeal may be taken from:

(1) An order denying an application to compel arbitration made under § 29-
5-303;

. . .

(b) The appeal shall be taken in the manner and to the same extent as from 
orders or judgments in a civil action.

Id. § 29-5-319.  “This Court has interpreted section 29-5-319 to mean that an immediate 
appeal  to  this  Court  may  be  taken  as  soon  as  a  motion  to  compel  arbitration  is  denied, 
notwithstanding whether other issues remain.”  Nandigam Neurology, PLC v. Beavers, 639 
S.W.3d 651, 661 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2021).  

When determining whether an appeal lies under section 29-5-319, “we look to the 
substance of the trial court’s orders . . . .”  Regions Bank, 2021 WL 3910696, at *4.  Here, 
the trial court did not enter “[a]n order denying an application to compel arbitration made 
under  §  29-5-303.”    Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  29-5-319(a)(1) (emphasis  added).    Instead, 
Defendants  filed  a  proposed  “Notice  of  Intent  to  Arbitrate  and  Order  to  Compel 
Arbitration” in accordance with the court’s order.  See SJR Ltd. P’ship v. Christie’s Inc., 
No. W2013-01606-COA-R3-CV, 2014 WL 869743, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2014) 
(finding that the defendant did not make an “application” to compel arbitration pursuant to 
Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-5-303).  The court then declined to approve it for 
entry because the parties could not agree on the issues to be submitted to arbitration.3 The 
court’s reasoning for doing so was clearly stated in its previous order entered in January 
2022: “If the parties do not enter into an Agreed Order submitting all issues to arbitration, 
then this Court will enter an Order as to which issues will be submitted to arbitration.”  As 
previously  discussed,  if  the  court  declined  to  enter  the proposed  “Notice  of  Intent  to 
Arbitrate and Order to Compel  Arbitration,” Ms. Leslie requested that the court prepare 
and  enter  an  order  in  accordance  with the court’s  order  from  January  2022.    However, 
Defendants filed this appeal before the court had the opportunity to do so.

                                           
(Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-5-319).”  Regions Bank, 2021 WL 3910696, at *3 (citing Morgan Keegan & Co., 
401 S.W.3d at 607).  Thus, the Tennessee Supreme Court has held that “if Tennessee’s appellate courts 
have subject matter jurisdiction to hear” an appeal from an order, “the grant of jurisdiction must be found 
in the [TUAA], not the [FAA].”  Id. (quoting Morgan Keegan & Co., 401 S.W.3d at 607).

3 As stated earlier, Defendants proposed to have the entire matter transferred to arbitration for final 
adjudication of all the issues in dispute.  However, Ms. Compton was not amenable to submitting all of the 
issues  to  arbitration.    She  did  not  believe  that  this  matter  was  appropriate  for  any  of  the  issues  to  be 
submitted to arbitration due to the allegations of fraud.
- 6 -

In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court’s order is not appealable 
under Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-5-319.  Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal 
because this Court is without subject matter jurisdiction.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the aforementioned reasons, this appeal is dismissed.  Costs of this appeal are 
taxed to the appellants, Kathy A. Leslie and Penthouse Hospitality Group, LLC, for which 
execution may issue if necessary.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
