      <pre>IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT NASHVILLE
Assigned on Briefs March 21, 2023

LEROY SEXTON, JR. v. STATE OF TENNESSEE

Appeal from the Criminal Court for Fentress County

No. 9493

E. Shayne Sexton, Judge

___________________________________

No. M2022-00100-CCA-R3-PC
___________________________________

The Petitioner’s original and untimely petition for post-conviction relief was dismissed on 
the merits because all his claims were either waived or previously determined.  Thereafter, 
the  Petitioner  filed  a  second  petition  alleging  that  the  statute  of  limitations  for  his  first 
petition should have been tolled due to his then mental incompetency.  The post-conviction 
court  dismissed  the  second  petition,  finding  that  the  Petitioner  was  not  mentally 
incompetent.    On  appeal,  we  conclude  that,  because  the  Petitioner’s  first  petition  was 
resolved on the merits, any second or subsequent petition is barred, and any issue regarding
the timely filing of the first petition is immaterial.  Accordingly, we respectfully affirm the 
judgment of the post-conviction court.  

Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; 
Judgment of the Criminal Court Affirmed

TOM GREENHOLTZ, J., delivered  the  opinion  of  the  court,  in  which  TIMOTHY L. EASTER
and JOHN W. CAMPBELL, SR., JJ., joined.

Jay  Umerley,  Nashville,  Tennessee (on  appeal)  and  Thomas  Harding Potter,  Allardt, 
Tennessee (at post-conviction hearing), for the appellant, Leroy Sexton, Jr.

Jonathan  Skrmetti,  Attorney  General  and  Reporter;  Brooke  A.  Huppenthal,  Assistant 
Attorney General; Jared Effler, District Attorney General; and Philip A. Kazee and Jade 
A. Peters, Assistant District Attorneys General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.

OPINION

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

On September 21, 2001, a Fentress County jury found the Petitioner guilty of child 
rape, and the trial court sentenced the Petitioner to a term of twenty-five years.  This Court 

03/22/2023affirmed the conviction and sentence, and the supreme court denied permission to appeal 
on May 14, 2007.  See State v. Sexton, No. M2004-03076-CCA-R3-CD, 2007 WL 92352 
(Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 12, 2007), perm. app. denied (Tenn. May 14, 2007) (Sexton I).

The  Petitioner  filed  a  petition  for  post-conviction  relief  on  May  22,  2008,  in  the 
wrong county of venue, and he later filed another petition in Fentress County on November 
6, 2008.  The post-conviction court summarily dismissed the Fentress County petition as 
being  untimely.    The  court  also  found  that  all  claims  were  either  waived  or  previously 
determined.  See Sexton v. State, No. M2009-01018-CCA-R3-PC, 2010 WL 653007, at *1 
(Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 24, 2010), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Sept. 13, 2010) (Sexton II).  

The Petitioner appealed the dismissal, arguing that due process principles tolled the 
running of the statute of limitations.  This Court agreed that the filing of the post-conviction 
petition was “well outside the statute of limitations.”  Sexton II, 2010 WL 653007, at *2.  
However,  because  all  of  the  Petitioner’s  previous  claims  were  waived  or  previously 
determined, we affirmed the summary dismissal of the petition without deciding whether 
due process principles tolled the running of the statute of limitations.  Id. at *4 (“[W]e need 
not remand for a determination as to whether due process requires the tolling of the statute 
of limitations.  Even if the statute of limitations were to be tolled the issues presented by 
Petitioner are waived or previously determined.”).  

On April 8, 2011, the Petitioner filed a second petition for post-conviction relief, 
reasserting many of the same substantive grounds he had previously raised.  In a purported 
affidavit  attached  to  this  petition,  the  Petitioner  explained  why  he  was  filing  a  second 
petition for post-conviction relief: 

I would like to explain why I’m filing my Post-Conviction at this time.  On 
January 12, 2011, I found I was mentally incompetent from February the 13th 
of  2007  until  July  21,  2009.  It  was  during  this  time  that  I  filed  my  Post-
Conviction.  

The Petitioner also asserted that his lawyer failed to explain when the statute of limitations 
would run and did not clarify that he no longer represented him.  As such, the Petitioner

placed  [his first  petition]  in  the  Prison  mail  box  on  May,  15  2009 [sic] 
missing the 1 year de[a]dline by (1) one day.” . . .  Then on January 21, 2011
I  found  that  I  was  Mentally  Incompetent and  that  is  why  I  am  filing  this 
second Post-Conviction.  

Following delays that are not readily explained from the record, the Petitioner filed 
two additional amended petitions relating back to this second petition, with the last being

filed in October 2016.  As part of these amendments, the Petitioner attempted to subpoena 
Dr. William Diebold, a Tennessee Department of Correction physician, to testify in support 
of his petition.  After substantial litigation over whether this physician could be compelled 
to attend a hearing or to testify by deposition, Sexton v. State, No. M2017-00698-CCA-
WR-CO,  2018  WL  6266167  (Tenn.  Crim.  App.  Nov.  30,  2018) (Sexton  III),  the  parties 
ultimately decided to submit affidavits from Dr. Diebold in lieu of his testimony. 

After the Petitioner filed a third amended petition in September 2017, the State filed 
a motion to dismiss the second petition.  The State initially argued that the petition was an 
improper second petition.  However, it also later asserted that the Petitioner failed to show 
that  he  acted  with  reasonable  diligence  in  seeking  post-conviction  relief  to  benefit  from 
due process tolling of the statute of limitations.  

The  post-conviction  court  held  a  hearing  on  the  State’s  motions  to  dismiss  on 
November  16,  2021.    In  its  formal  order  dismissing  the  petition,  which  was  filed  on 
December 27, 2021, the post-conviction court found that the Petitioner “failed to establish 
a prima facie case that he was incompetent in order to toll the statute of limitations and 
bring another Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.”  

The Petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal on January 24, 2022.  On appeal, he 
asserts that the post-conviction court erred in dismissing his second petition and that his 
prior incompetency tolled the original statute of limitations.  For its part, the State argues 
that the petition represents an impermissible second petition and that the post-conviction 
court also properly denied the second petition on the merits.  On our review, we respectfully 
affirm the dismissal of the Petitioner’s post-conviction petition.

STANDARD OF APPELLATE REVIEW

Our supreme court has recognized that “the first question for a reviewing court on 
any issue is ‘what is the appropriate standard of review?’”  State v. Enix, 653 S.W.3d 692, 
698  (Tenn.  2022).    The  principal  issue  in  this  case  is  whether  the  Petitioner  may file  a 
second petition for post-conviction relief to raise a new ground upon which the original 
statute of limitations could have been tolled.  “This court reviews a post-conviction court’s 
summary dismissal of a post-conviction petition de novo.”  Odom v. State, No. M2022-
00252-CCA-R3-PC, 2022 WL 17261526, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 29, 2022) (citing 
Burnett v. State, 92 S.W.3d 403, 406 (Tenn. 2002)).  

The Tennessee Post-Conviction Procedure Act provides an avenue for relief “when 
the  conviction  or  sentence  is  void  or  voidable  because  of  the  abridgment  of  any  right

guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  of  Tennessee  or  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States.” 
Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-103 (2018).  To initiate post-conviction proceedings, a petitioner 
must first file “a written petition for relief[.]”  Woodard v. State, No. M2022-00162-CCA-
R3-PC, 2022 WL 4932885, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 4, 2022), no perm. app. This 
petition must  “allege the abridgment of a constitutionally  guaranteed right.”  Wallace v. 
State, No. E2017-02481-CCA-R3-PC, 2019 WL 1959764, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 
2, 2019).  It must also “contain a clear and specific statement of all grounds upon which 
relief is sought, including full disclosure of the factual basis of those grounds.”  Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 40-30-106(d) (2018).

Importantly,  however,  a  post-conviction  petitioner  generally  cannot  file  multiple 
petitions attacking a single judgment of conviction.  Indeed, a second or subsequent petition 
for  post-conviction  relief  is  specifically  barred  by  statute  and  court  rule.    For  example, 
Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-30-102(c) (2018) provides:

This part contemplates the filing of only one (1) petition for post-conviction 
relief.  In no event may more than one (1) petition for post-conviction relief 
be filed attacking a single judgment.  If a prior petition has been filed which 
was resolved on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, any second 
or subsequent petition shall be summarily dismissed.  A petitioner may move 
to reopen a post-conviction proceeding that has been concluded, under the 
limited circumstances set out in § 40-30-117.

Similarly,  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  Rule  28,  section  5(B)  recognizes  that  “[e]ach 
petitioner  shall  be  entitled  to  file  only  one  petition  for  each  conviction  or  sentence 
incurred.”

Despite the general prohibition on second or subsequent petitions, this general rule 
is also subject to a couple of exceptions.  First, the Act permits a petitioner to reopen the 
proceedings in specific circumstances.  These circumstances include, for example, where 
new  scientific  evidence  is  discovered  which  establishes  that  the  petitioner  is  “actually 
innocent” of the offenses, where the courts recognize a new rule of constitutional law that 
applies  retroactively,  and  where  the  petitioner’s  current  sentence  has  been  enhanced 
because of a previous conviction that has been held to be invalid.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-
30-117(a)(1)-(3) (2018).  

Second, a subsequent petition may be filed if the first petition was not resolved on 
the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-102(c).  This 
circumstance may occur, for example, where the petitioner withdraws a petition without 
prejudice  before the  hearing  and  then  later  refiles  a  timely  petition for  post-conviction 
relief.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-109(c) (2018).  Conversely, a petitioner may not file 
a second petition if the first was dismissed for a failure to state a claim for post-conviction 

- 4 -

relief.  Benson v. State, No. W2016-02346-CCA-R3-PC, 2018 WL 486000, at *5 (Tenn. 
Crim.  App. Jan. 19, 2018).  Our appellate courts have recognized that a post-conviction 
petition is resolved on the merits when it is dismissed because all of the identified claims 
have  been  waived  or  were  previously  determined.    Id.  at  *4  (citing  Blair  v.  State,  No. 
W1999-01847-CCA-R3-PC,  2000  WL  277138,  at  *1  (Tenn.  Crim.  App.  Jan.  12,  2000) 
(Order)).

In this case, the Petitioner does not assert that any of the grounds for reopening a 
post-conviction  petition  pursuant  to  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  40-30-117(a) 
(2018)  apply in  his  case.    Moreover,  the  Petitioner’s  first  untimely  petition  for  post-
conviction relief was, in fact, dismissed on the merits.  Although the Petitioner raised issues 
of due process tolling in that appeal, this Court did not address those issues.  Instead, we 
affirmed the dismissal of the first petition on the merits, finding that the petition failed to 
state a cognizable claim for post-conviction relief.  See Sexton II, 2010 WL 653007, at *2.  
Indeed, because all of the Petitioner’s claims in his original petition were either waived or 
previously  determined,  we  expressly  pretermitted  any  issue  regarding the  tolling  of  the 
original statute of limitations.  Id. 

Issues  related  to  the  running  of  the  statute  of  limitations are,  and  have  been,
irrelevant to whether the Petitioner is entitled to post-conviction relief.  As such, any claim 
that  the  Petitioner’s  earlier  incompetence  should  have  tolled  the  original  statute  of 
limitations is of no moment.  Cf. Putman v. State, No. E2019-01608-CCA-R3-PC, 2020 
WL  1161338,  at  *2  (Tenn.  Crim.  App.  Mar. 9,  2020)  (concluding  that  the  second  post-
conviction petition was barred when post-conviction court summarily dismissed the first 
petition  as  untimely  and  found  that  it  failed  to  assert  a  colorable  claim). Accordingly, 
because no exception exists to the statutory prohibition on filing a second or subsequent 
petition for post-conviction relief, we conclude that the Petitioner’s second petition must 
be summarily dismissed pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-30-102(c).

CONCLUSION 

In summary, we hold that Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-30-102(c) bars the 
filing of the Petitioner’s second petition for post-conviction relief because his first petition 
was  resolved  on  the  merits  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.    Accordingly,  we
respectfully  affirm  the  judgment  of  the  post-conviction  court summarily  dismissing  the 
petition.
