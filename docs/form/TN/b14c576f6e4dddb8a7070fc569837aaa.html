      <pre>PENNY LAWSON ET AL. v. HAWKINS COUNTY, TENNESSEE ET AL.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF TENNESSEE
AT KNOXVILLE
May 25, 2022 Session Heard at Cookeville1

Appeal by Permission from the Court of Appeals
Circuit Court for Hawkins County

No. 20-CV-37
Alex E. Pearson, Judge
___________________________________

No. E2020-01529-SC-R11-CV
___________________________________

HOLLY KIRBY, J., concurring.

I  concur  in  the  majority’s  analysis  and  holding  that  Tennessee  Code  Annotated 
section 29-20-205 removes immunity for Hawkins County only for ordinary negligence, 
not gross negligence or recklessness. I write separately to highlight an issue not addressed
in the majority opinion—whether we should continue to apply the common law public duty
doctrine and the related special duty exception in cases where the legislature has addressed 
the issue of immunity by statute.

We  have described  the  public  duty  doctrine:  “[P]rivate  citizens,  as  such,  cannot 
maintain an action complaining of the wrongful acts of public officials unless such private 
citizens aver special interest or a special injury not common to the public generally.” Ezell 
v. Cockrell, 902 S.W.2d 394, 397 (Tenn. 1995) (quoting Bennett v. Stutts, 521 S.W.2d 575, 
576  (Tenn.  1975)  (Fones,  C.J.,  concurring)).
In  other  words, “the  public  duty  doctrine 
shield[s]  public  employees  from  tort  liability for  injuries  caused  by  a  public  employee's 
breach of a duty owed to the public at large.” Chase v. City of Memphis, 971 S.W.2d 380, 
385 (Tenn. 1998). An exception to the public duty doctrine’s shield from liability arises 
where there is “a ‘special relationship’ . . . between the plaintiff and the public employee, 
which  gives  rise  to  a  ‘special  duty’ that  is  more  particular  than  the  duty  owed  by  the 
employee to the public at large.” Ezell, 902 S.W.2d at 401.  The special duty exception 
removes public duty immunity in three situations:

(1) a public official affirmatively undertakes to protect the plaintiff and the 
plaintiff relies upon the undertaking;

                                           

1  Oral argument was heard in this case on the campus of Tennessee Tech University in Cookeville, 
Tennessee, as part of the Tennessee American Legion Boys State S.C.A.L.E.S. (Supreme Court Advancing 
Legal Education for Students) project.

02/16/2023(2) a statute specifically provides for a cause of action against an official or 
municipality  for  injuries  resulting  to  a  particular  class  of  individuals,  of 
which the plaintiff is a member, from failure to enforce certain laws; or

(3) a plaintiff alleges a cause of action involving intent, malice, or reckless 
misconduct.

Chase, 971 S.W.2d at 385 (citing Ezell, 902 S.W.2d at 402). 

The  public  duty  doctrine  and  the  special  duty  exception  both  existed  at  common 
law, long before Tennessee’s adoption of the  Governmental Tort  Liability  Act (GTLA).
Ezell,  902  S.W.2d  at  397,  401.
In  Ezell,  the  Court  held that  “the  public  duty  doctrine 
survived  enactment  of  the  Tennessee  Governmental  Tort  Liability  Act, and  that  sound 
public policy supports” continued application of the public duty doctrine in Tennessee, “as 
well as the continuing validity of the ‘special-duty’ of care exception to the doctrine.” Id. 
at 404. Ezell reasoned that, in the wake of enactment of the GTLA, the public duty doctrine 
continues to serve “the important purpose of preventing excessive court intervention into 
the governmental process by protecting the exercise of law enforcement discretion.” Id. at 
400–01. 

After  holding  in  Ezell that  both  the  public  duty  doctrine  and  the  special  duty 
exception remain in effect alongside the GTLA, the Court in Chase explained how those 
common law concepts interact with the GTLA: 

The  special  duty  exception  to  the  public  duty  doctrine  is  applicable  only 
when  immunity  has  been  removed  under  the  GTLA. The  special  duty 
exception  does  not  create  liability  but  negates  the  public  duty  doctrine,  a 
defense to liability.  Accordingly, unless immunity has been removed by the 
GTLA, a plaintiff cannot recover damages against a government entity even 
if the special duty exception to the public duty doctrine is applicable.

Chase, 971 S.W.2d at 385.

Meanwhile,  the  legislature  has  enacted a  host  of  special  statutory  provisions  and 
exceptions regarding governmental immunity. Some are consistent with the standards of 
the  public  duty  doctrine  and  the  special  duty exception,  others  are  not. See,  e.g.,  Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 29-20-201(d) (“Notwithstanding this chapter or any other law to the contrary, 
a  governmental  entity  that  places  and  properly  maintains  a  clearly  visible  and  adequate 
flood warning sign or barricade at a flooded road area shall be immune from suit for any 
injury  resulting  from  a  violation  of  §  55-10-205(c). The  immunity  from  suit  shall  be 
removed  when the  governmental  entity's  conduct  amounts  to  willful,  wanton,  or  gross 
negligence.”); Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-20-205(10) (“[I]n connection with any loss, damage, 
injury,  or  death  arising  from  COVID-19 .  .  .  ,  unless  the  claimant  proves  by  clear  and 

-2-

convincing evidence that the loss, damage, injury, or death was proximately caused by an 
act or omission by the entity or its employees constituting gross negligence.”); Tenn. Code 
Ann.  §  29-20-108(a) (“Emergency  communications  district  boards . . .  shall  be  immune 
from any claim, complaint or suit of any nature which relates to or arises from the conduct 
of the affairs of the board except in cases of gross negligence by such board . . . .”).

Thus, even before our decision here, layering the common law public duty doctrine 
and the special duty exception on top of the GTLA and other immunity statutes meant that 
plaintiffs  in  lawsuits  alleging misconduct  by  employees  of  governmental  entities  must
navigate  a  labyrinth  of  confusing  and  at  times conflicting  statutory  and  common  law 
standards. 

Unfortunately,  that Rubik’s  cube  effect  is  not  improved  by  our  holding  in  this 
appeal, interpreting  the GTLA to remove immunity for negligence by an employee of a 
governmental entity, but not for the employee’s gross negligence or recklessness. In the 
briefs, Lawson’s counsel argues that the interpretation of the GTLA we adopt could create 
a Catch-22 for plaintiffs. Counsel is not incorrect on this point. If the plaintiff’s complaint 
alleges  that  the  governmental  entity’s  employee  was  reckless  in  order to  qualify  for the 
“reckless  misconduct” special duty exception  to the public duty doctrine, then dismissal 
under  the  GTLA  is  likely  because  immunity  is  not  removed  for  reckless  conduct. 
Conversely, if the complaint alleges that the governmental employee was negligent in order
to  avoid  dismissal  under  the  GTLA,  the  plaintiff risks  dismissal  under  the  public  duty 
doctrine  by  making  his  claim ineligible for  the  special  duty  exception  for  reckless 
misconduct.2

As  explained  in  the  majority  opinion,  we  are  bound  to  interpret  the  GTLA 
according to its text. I agree. However, we are not bound to follow common law precedent, 
particularly where there have been changes in the law, Five Star Exp., Inc. v. Davis, 866 
S.W.2d 944, 949 (Tenn. 1993), changing conditions, Metro. Gov’t of Nashville v. Poe, 383 
S.W.2d 265, 277 (Tenn. 1964), or where the precedent proves unworkable, Rye v. Women's 
Care  Ctr.  of  Memphis,  MPLLC,  477  S.W.3d  235,  263  (Tenn.  2015) (citing  Payne  v. 
Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991)).  Though adhering to past decisions is the preferred 
course,  “[o]ur  oath  is  to  do  justice,  not  to  perpetuate  error.” Rye,  477  S.W.3d  at  263 
(quoting Montgomery v. Stephan, 101 N.W.2d 227, 229 (Mich. 1960)).

The question of whether we should continue to apply the public duty doctrine and 
the special duty exception was not raised as an issue in this appeal, so addressing it here 
would not be appropriate. Still, our holding may provide impetus to reconsider Ezell. The 

                                           

2  The majority opinion rightly notes that our holding is with respect to claims against governmental 
entities and does not affect claims against individual employees. However, this may be cold comfort for 
plaintiffs, who are unlikely to get appropriate compensation for serious injuries from  judgments against
individual government employees.  

-3-

Ezell Court  rightly  considered  the  policy  reasons  that  prompted  our  courts  to  adopt  the 
public  duty  doctrine  and  the  special  duty  exception  long  before  the  GTLA  and  other 
statutes  on  governmental  immunity. Ezell,  902  S.W.2d  at  400–01. But  even  Ezell
acknowledged  that  the  standards  under  the  public  duty  doctrine  and  the  special  duty 
exception differed from some statutes on governmental immunity.  Id. at 402.  The Ezell
Court could not have foreseen the complexities of how those common law concepts would 
interact with an array of comprehensive, detailed statutes on governmental immunity, some 
added years later. We can now see how it has all played out. 

In  a  future  case,  I  hope we  can  look  squarely  at  whether  we  should  continue  to 
adhere to Ezell, limit application of the public duty doctrine and the special duty exception, 
or  discontinue application  of  those  common  law  principles  in  deference  to  the  statutes 
governing immunity.
