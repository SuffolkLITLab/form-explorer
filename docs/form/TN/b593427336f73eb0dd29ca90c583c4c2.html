Westmoreland Law Firm. 

MEMORANDUM OPINION2

In 2017, Tino C. Sutton (“Plaintiff”) was a tenant in an apartment complex managed 
by  Peacock  Realty  Group (“Peacock  Realty”).  Robert  Allison,  who  owns and  operates
                                           
1 Sitting by interchange. 

2 Rule 10 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals of Tennessee provides:

This Court, with the concurrence of all judges participating in the case, may affirm, reverse 
or modify the actions of the trial court by memorandum opinion when a formal opinion 
would have  no precedential  value.  When a case  is decided by  memorandum  opinion it 
shall be designated “MEMORANDUM OPINION”, shall not be published, and shall not 
be cited or relied on for any reason in any unrelated case.

03/21/2023Peacock  Realty,  filed  a  detainer  warrant  against  Plaintiff  in  July  2017.    Following  his 
receipt of the warrant, Plaintiff met with Attorney Charles P. Westmoreland (“Attorney”) 
to  discuss  legal  representation.    The  parties  agreed  to  a  $1,000  retainer;  however,  the 
agreement was never memorialized in writing.  The parties did not discuss whether the fee 
was refundable or which party was responsible for payment of any filing fees.  

Throughout their discussions, Plaintiff advised Attorney that he also sought to file 
a counter-complaint against Peacock Realty, claiming that his apartment was unlivable due 
to a water leak prior to his alleged nonpayment of rent.  He provided  Attorney with the 
pertinent  facts  and  made  an  initial  deposit  of  $700  on  the  retainer.    Attorney filed  the 
answer and a counter-complaint on July 28, 2017. 

On August 1, 2017, the parties appeared before the trial court and advised the court 
that Plaintiff had vacated the apartment on July 28.  The matter was reset for hearing on 
damages for the detainer warrant and the counter-complaint.  During the pendency of the 
hearing, Plaintiff met with Attorney and paid the remaining $300 of the retainer fee.  

The  parties  appeared  before  the  court  again on  August  8.    At  this  point,  the  trial 
court  advised  Plaintiff  that  the  filing  fees  for  his  counter-complaint  had  not  been  paid.  
Plaintiff requested additional time in which to remit payment.  The court denied the request 
and  dismissed  the  counter-complaint.    The  hearing  continued  on  the  matter  of  Peacock 
Realty’s claimed damages.  

During  cross-examination,  Mr.  Allison  ultimately  conceded  that  his  accounting 
contained errors, prompting the withdrawal of his claim for damages.  The trial court found 
that Peacock Realty was entitled to possession but that it would not award damages based 
upon the testimony presented.  At the conclusion of the trial, Plaintiff terminated Attorney’s 
representation, presumably based upon the trial court’s dismissal of the counter-complaint 
for failure to remit payment of the filing fees.  

Despite the court’s pronouncement, the General Sessions Court Clerk erroneously 
entered a judgment against Plaintiff for damages in the amount of $1,256.50.  This was a 
clerical  error.    Plaintiff  discovered  the  judgment  when  he  went  to  the  Clerk’s  office  to 
appeal the dismissal of his counter-complaint.  He did not inform  Attorney of the error.  
Instead, he filed his appeal and a counter-complaint against Peacock Realty without legal 
representation.  The erroneous judgment against Plaintiff was extinguished.  Plaintiff also 
entered into a settlement agreement with Peacock Realty in which he received $1,000.

Approximately one year later, on August 8, 2018, Plaintiff filed the instant action 
against  Attorney and  his  law  firm,  with  claims  for  breach  of  contract,  malpractice,  and 
violations of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act.  The court advised Plaintiff to file 
an amended complaint that conformed with the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.  In 
the amended 79-page complaint, Plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that Attorney did not deposit 
- 2 -

the $1,000 retainer in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation account as required by the 
Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct.  Plaintiff further claimed that Attorney failed to 
pay the filing fees required for the proper filing of his counter-complaint, resulting in the 
dismissal of the action.  Lastly, Plaintiff alleged that Attorney failed to advise him of the 
erroneous judgment entered against him.  

Attorney denied Plaintiff’s allegations and claimed that Plaintiff was barred from 
recovery when he suffered no actual damages for which relief can be granted.  Attorney
moved for summary judgment dismissal of the action.  The court granted the motion, in 
part, dismissing all claims for legal malpractice that necessitated expert witness testimony.  

The case proceeded to a final hearing on May 13, 2021.  No transcript or statement 
of the hearing was provided for this court’s review.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the 
court made the following credibility findings: 

For the most part, the outcome of this trial turns upon the credibility of the 
witnesses.    The  Court  finds  the  testimony  of  [Attorney],  Deputy  Clerk 
Holder, and Judge Rich to be credible.  On the other hand, the Court finds 
the  testimony  of  [Plaintiff]  to  be  not  credible.    The  Court  listened  and 
observed  the  witnesses  in  this  case  very  closely.   In  doing  so,  it  finds  that 
[Plaintiff] changed his testimony during the trial; that [Plaintiff’s] testimony 
was contradicted by what he said at another time and by the testimony of the 
other  witnesses;  that  [Plaintiff]  attempted  to  evade  questions;  and  that  at 
times, [Plaintiff’s] testimony bordered on the absurd. 

The court found that Plaintiff failed to prove any unfair or deceptive act and that Attorney’s 
representation resulted in the dismissal of damages.  The court further found that Attorney
had no obligation to obtain a copy of the erroneous judgment when his representation was 
terminated.    The  court  noted  that  the  parties did  not  reach  an  agreement  concerning  the 
payment  of  court  costs  and that  the  counter-complaint  was  re-filed  and  resulted  in  a 
successful agreement.  The court dismissed all remaining claims of legal malpractice based 
upon Plaintiff’s lack of credibility.  This appeal followed.  

In non-jury cases such as this one, we review the trial court’s factual findings de 
novo  upon  the  record,  affording  them  a  presumption  of  correctness  unless  the  evidence 
preponderates  otherwise.    See Tenn.  R.  App.  P.  13(d); Armbrister  v.  Armbrister,  414 
S.W.3d 685, 692 (Tenn. 2013).  We review questions of law de novo, affording the trial 
court’s  decision  no  presumption  of  correctness.    Armbrister,  414  S.W.3d  at  692  (citing
Mills v. Fulmarque, 360 S.W.3d 362, 366 (Tenn. 2012)).  The trial court’s determinations 
regarding witness credibility are  entitled  to  great  weight  on  appeal  and  shall  not  be 
disturbed  absent  clear  and  convincing  evidence  to  the  contrary.    Morrison  v.  Allen,  338 
S.W.3d 417, 426 (Tenn. 2011).

We,  like  the  trial  court,  fail  to  see  any  unfair  or  deceptive  act  perpetuated  by 
Attorney in his representation of Plaintiff when said representation resulted in the dismissal 
of the claim for damages.  While the counter-complaint was initially dismissed, Plaintiff’s 
re-filing of the claim ultimately resulted in a settlement.  The erroneous judgment was also 
dismissed once the clerk’s clerical error was discovered by the court.  The record before 
this court is simply devoid of any theory through which Plaintiff was harmed by Attorney’s 
legal representation.  

Moreover, no transcript or  statement  of  the  evidence  relating  to  the  trial  was 
provided  in  the  appellate  record.3 This  significantly  hinders  our  ability  to  determine 
whether Plaintiff, who was found not credible by the trial court, is entitled to any relief. 
“The  absence  of  either  a transcript or  a  statement  of  the  evidence  significantly  ties  the 
hands  of  the  appellate  court.”    Chandler  v.  Chandler,  No.  W2010-01503-COA-R3-CV, 
2012  WL  2393698,  at  *6  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  June  26,  2012).  It  is  Plaintiff’s  duty  as  the 
appellant “to prepare the record which conveys a fair, accurate, and complete account of 
what transpired in the trial court regarding the issues which form the basis of the appeal.”  
In re M.L.D., 182 S.W.3d 890, 894 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005); see also Tenn. R. App. P. 24(b), 
(c)  (“[T]he  appellant  shall  have  prepared  a transcript of  such  part  of  the  evidence  or 
proceedings  as  is  necessary  to  convey  a  fair,  accurate  and  complete  account  of  what 
transpired with respect to those issues that are the bases of appeal.”).  As noted in previous 
cases, the lack of a transcript or statement of the evidence is  generally fatal to the party 
having the burden on appeal.  Sherrod v. Wix, 849 S.W.2d 780, 783 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992). 
It is well settled that, “in the absence of a transcript or statement of the evidence, there is a 
conclusive presumption that there was sufficient evidence before the Trial Court to support 
its judgment and this Court must therefore affirm the judgment.”  Brown v. Christian Bros. 
Univ., 428 S.W.3d 38, 48 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2013) (quoting Outdoor Mgmt., LLC v. Thomas, 
249 S.W.3d 368, 377 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007)); see also Word v. Word, 937 S.W.2d 931, 932 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 1996). 

For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision of the trial court.  The case is 
remanded for such further proceedings as may be necessary.  Costs of the appeal are taxed 
to the appellant, Tino C. Sutton.
