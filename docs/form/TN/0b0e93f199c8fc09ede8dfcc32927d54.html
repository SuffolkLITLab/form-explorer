      <pre>The 2013 Tennessee Pro Bono Report 

Executive Summary 

 

The efforts of the Tennessee Supreme Court and the Access to Justice Commission to 
increase  pro  bono  services  and  pro  bono  reporting  are  having  an  impact  on 
Tennessee’s licensed attorneys. 

Based on information and statistics collected, attorneys have provided most of their pro 
bono  assistance  by  directly  helping  low-income  Tennesseans  with  their  legal  needs. 
Since 2010, when attorneys were first asked to voluntarily report their pro bono hours, 
Tennessee  attorneys  have  shown  they  are  generously  responding  to  the  civil  legal 
needs gap by donating more time to pro bono projects. 

In 2011, the Access to Justice Commission recommended and the Tennessee Supreme 
Court approved a streamlined Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form that has aided in the 
reporting  of  pro  bono  activity  hours  by  attorneys.  Continuing  its  support  of  pro  bono 
reporting  by  attorneys,  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  sent  a  letter  to  all  licensed 
attorneys  in  their  2012  annual  attorney  license  renewal  packets  from  the  Board  of 
Professional Responsibility, encouraging the voluntary reporting of pro bono hours.  

n 2013, 42.13% of Tennessee’s licensed attorneys reported 672,976 hours of pro bono 
work,  for  an  average  of  73.80  hours  per  attorney  reporting  pro  bono  work.  This  is 
significantly above the national average. The pro bono legal services were provided and 
reported in four categories:   

●  Legal  services  without  a  fee  or  at  a  substantially  reduced  fee  to  persons  of 

limited means; 

means; 

●  Legal services without a fee to non-profit organizations serving persons of limited 

●  Legal  services  to  groups  and  organizations  at  a  reduced  fee  when  payment  of 

standard fees would create a financial hardship; and 

●  Legal services to improve the law, the legal system, or the legal profession.

Since  2010,  the  number  of  hours  of  pro  bono  work  reported  more  than  doubled  from 
294,672 hours to 672,976 hours.  While there was a decrease in the average hours per 
attorney  from  2010  to  2013  by  5.88  hours,  there  has  been  a  dramatic  increase  in  the 
overall  amount  of  pro  bono  legal  service  in  Tennessee.    Forty-two  percent  of  all 
attorneys  voluntarily  reported  providing  pro  bono  services  during  2012.  For  those  who 
reported, the average number of pro bono hours provided per attorney was significantly 
higher  than  50  hours  during  the  year.    In  a  short  period  of  time,  the  Commission  has 
come close to achieving this goal. 

The pro bono services reporting data for this report was obtained from the Tennessee 
Board of Professional Responsibility. Organizations involved in providing legal services 
or  non-legal  services,  such  as  mediation,  were  surveyed  on  the  amount  of  pro  bono 
conducted through their organization.  The Commission on Continuing Legal Education 
and Specialization also contributed to this report.   

The  members  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Tennessee  and  the  Access  to  Justice 
Commission, thank the Tennessee licensed attorneys, legal services organizations, bar 
associations, mediators, judges, and all those involved in providing legal assistance or 
working  with  those  that  provide  legal  assistance  to  low-income  members  of  their 
communities. You have made access to justice a reality for countless Tennesseans.

Attorney Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Statistics 

The  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  adopted  Supreme  Court  Rule  9,  Section  20.11  on 
November  2,  2009.  The  Rule  requests  that  every  attorney  who  is  required  to  file  an 
Annual  Registration  Statement  with  the  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility  (“BPR”) 
voluntarily file a statement reporting the attorney’s pro bono service and activity during 
the last calendar year. The Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form was first included in the 
2010 BPR Registration Statement and reported data for the 2009 calendar year. 

The Tennessee Supreme Court approved a change in BPR Registration procedures to 
require  renewals  on  the  first  day  of  each  attorney’s  birth  month.  Under  this  new 
procedure, pro bono reporting data for the previous calendar year is not available until 
all reporting for that year has been received. 

The Access to Justice Commission now has pro bono reporting data for pro bono work 
reported  in  four  calendar  years,  2010  to  2013.  The  Access  to  Justice  Commission  is 
pleased  to  provide  an  analysis  of  the  2013  data  and  a  comparison  to  that  of  the 
previous three years. 

eginning in the 2013 Pro Bono Report and in all future Pro Bono Reports, the data will 
be labeled to correspond with the year the pro bono work was reported, not the year the 
pro bono work was performed.  For example, the pro bono work reported in 2013 and 
completed in 2012 will be labeled as the 2013 Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Statistics.

2013 Statistics 

Pursuant  to  the  Access  to  Justice  Commission’s  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Access  to 
Justice  Commission  is  focused  on  pro  bono  work  that  aids  Tennesseans.  The  2013 
statistics reflect pro bono work performed in 2012 and reported during the 2013 annual 
registration period.  The 2013 reporting form asked for feedback from attorneys in four 
categories of pro bono service.  
 

●  Legal  services  without  a  fee  or  at  a  substantially  reduced  fee  to  persons  of 

limited means; 

means; 

●  Legal services without a fee to non-profit organizations serving persons of limited 

●  Legal  services  to  groups  and  organizations  at  a  reduced  fee  when  payment  of 

standard fees would create a financial hardship; and 

●  Legal services to improve the law, the legal system, or the legal profession.

The  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility  (“BPR”)  was  requested  to  break  down  the 
hours  reported  by  Tennessee  Government  Attorneys.  The  BPR  also  disclosed  the 
number  of  attorneys  who  indicated  they  were  in-house  counsel;  however,  we  did  not 
request  that  the  BPR  break  down  the  number  of  hours  this  category  of  attorneys 
provided.  In  the  2010  and  2011data,  the  hours  reported  by  Tennessee  Government

Overall Results 

Access to justice cannot be achieved without collaboration. The multiple partners of the 
Court  and  the  Commission  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  many  volunteers  on  the 
Commission's  numerous  committees  and  work  groups,  attorneys,  legal  services 
organizations,  bar  associations,  law  schools  and  law  students,  mediators,  judges,  and 
countless volunteers involved in providing day-to-day assistance to those needing legal 
services  within  their  communities.  The  results  of  these  efforts  are  over  650,000  pro 
bono service hours reported in 2013.

Additional Information, Data and Survey Highlights 

Bar Association Pro Bono 

Using www.surveymonkey.com, the Pro Bono Coordinator surveyed regional and local 
bar  associations  about  the  pro  bono  initiatives  and  efforts  sponsored  by  each  bar 
association. Bar association presidents were emailed a link to complete the survey. The 
Pro Bono Coordinator followed up with phone calls and emails to encourage additional 
responses. 

To  date,  23  responses  were  received  from  bar  associations.  Highlights  and  insights 
obtained  from  some  of  the  survey  responses  are  listed  below.    A  chart  detailing  pro 
bono opportunities and pro bono statistics for the bar associations is attached as Exhibit 
A.

Information 

Law School Pro Bono 

In  its  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Access  to  Justice  Commission  acknowledged  the 
importance of introducing pro bono services to future attorneys while they are still in law 
school. The Access to Justice Commission committed to convening meetings with law 
school deans, law school pro bono directors, and students at least annually to explore 

13 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increasing the participation of law students in pro bono activities. The Commission also 
compiled  the  pro  bono  policies  of  Tennessee  law  schools  into  one  document,  a  Pro 
Bono Policy Compilation, as a resource for Tennessee law schools and for law schools 
nationwide. 

The  ATJ  Commission  partnered  with  the  Tennessee  Bar  Association’s  Access  to 
Justice  Committee  to  sponsor  two  statewide  meetings  for  law  school  Deans,  faculty, 
and  students  to  discuss  issues  specific  to  pro  bono  work  done  by  law  students.    The 
first meeting was held at Belmont College of Law in Nashville and the second was held 
at  the  University  of  Tennessee  College  of  Law  in  Knoxville.    As  a  result  of  these 
meetings,  the  ATJ  Commission  developed  a  proposal  for  the  Supreme  Court  to 
recognize  law  student  pro  bono  work  which  the  Court  subsequently  adopted.    In 
addition, the ATJ Commission added law students to its Pro Bono Advisory Committee.  
The  Pro  Bono  Coordinator  and  ATJ  Coordinator  surveyed  the  six  law  schools  in 
Tennessee on their pro bono work done in 2013.   

Law School Survey Highlights 

●  Belmont  College  of  Law:  Thirty-five  percent  of  students  registered  pro  bono 
hours  through  the  Belmont  Legal  Aid  Society.    All  law  school  student 
organizations  must  conduct  one  public  service  project  each  academic  year  to 
remain  chartered  as  a  student  organization.    Belmont  has  partnered  with 
Magdalene House, a residential program for women who have survived lives of 
prostitution, trafficking, addiction and life on the streets.  The Magdalene House 
Legal Clinic endeavors to remove financial burdens that impede graduates from 
restarting  their  lives.    The  Clinic  guides  the  participants  through  the  process  of 
appealing  to  the  court  for  consolidation,  reduction  or  forgiveness  of  any 
outstanding court fees.  Law students assist attorneys as they draft motions and 
appear with the client in court to request debt forgiveness or reduction.   

●  Duncan  School  of  Law:  Law  students  are  required  to  complete  30  hours  of  pro 
bono  services  to  graduate.  Each  member  of  the  faculty  is  required  to  complete 
20 hours of pro bono per year to be considered for tenure. 

●  University of Tennessee: This law school offers seven different clinical programs. 
UT Pro Bono, a student-run organization, handles pro bono projects with faculty 
and  administrative  support.  Thirty-eight  percent  of  students  participated  in  pro 
bono activities in 2013.  All students are encouraged to give at least 50 hours of 
pro  bono  service  over  the  course  of  their  law  school  careers.    The  school  is 
planning to implement AccessKnoxville, a program designed to offer analysis and 
advice on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).   

14 
 

15 
 

  University of Memphis: The Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law has a graduation 
requirement of 40 hours of pro bono work.  The school defines pro bono service 
as  law-related  public  service  that  a  student  provides  without  compensation  or 
academic  credit.    The  law  school  partnered  with  a  host  of  organizations  in 
Memphis  including  but  not  limited  to  Memphis  Area  Legal  Services,  the 
Community  Legal  Center,  the  Public  Defender’s  and  District  Attorney’s  offices, 
the  MidSouth  Peace  and  Justice  Center,  the  Volunteer  Income  Taxpayer’s 
Assistance  Program  (VITA),and  Youth  Court.    Memphis  law  students  assisted 
the ATJ Commission directly by drafting plain language scripts for videos on how 
to  complete  plain  language  divorce  forms  and  translation  the  Supplemental 
Guidelines  and  Helpful  Information for  People  with  a  Case  in  General  Sessions 
Court into Spanish.   

  ●

●  Vanderbilt  University:  This  law  school  offers  five  different  clinical  programs.  Pro 
bono  organizations  include  Vanderbilt  Legal  Aid  Society  and  Law  Students  for 
Social Justice. Externship programs, stipends for internships, and post-graduate 
stipends are available, as well as loan repayment assistance. 

Legal Service Providers – Legal Services Corporation (“LSC”)-Funded 

In  Tennessee,  there  are  four  legal  aid  providers  that  receive  federal  funding  from  the 
Legal Services Corporation(“LSC”): Legal Aid of East Tennessee, Legal Aid Society of 
Middle  Tennessee  and  the  Cumberlands,  Memphis  Area  Legal  Services,  and  West 
Tennessee Legal  Services.  In  October  2011,  the  Access to  Justice  Commission  Chair 
and  the  Access  to  Justice  Coordinator  met  with  the  executive  directors  of  these 
organizations  to  begin  an  ongoing  discussion  about  how  the  Access  to  Justice 
Commission and the LSC-funded legal aid providers can collaborate to increase the pro 
bono assistance provided by Tennessee attorneys. The Access to Justice Commission 
Chair now holds quarterly conference calls with these directors. 

According to federal regulations, LSC-funded legal aid providers must use at least 12.5 
percent of their LSC funds for Private Attorney Involvement (pro bono). Each of the four 
LSC-funded  organizations  has  a  Pro  Bono  Coordinator/Director.  The  coordinators 
provide  a  wide  range  of  services  and  interact  with  a  variety  of  partners  to  provide 
assistance  to  substantial  numbers  of  clients.  These  services  range  from  arranging 
classic attorney-client representation to providing unbundled services. The coordinators 
also provide support services for pro bono activities such as intake, referrals to a variety 
of programs, continuing legal education, malpractice coverage, legal clinics, partnering

with  bar  associations  to  highlight  the  profession’s  commitment  to  access  to  justice, 
recognition activities, and numerous other activities. 

General  information  gathered  from  the  four  LSC-funded  organizations’  directors  and 
websites  is  provided  below.  A  chart  detailing  pro  bono  opportunities  and  pro  bono 
statistics for the organizations is attached as Exhibit B. 

•   Legal  Aid  of  East  Tennessee  (LAET):  LAET  has  been  part  of  the  community 
structure of East Tennessee for over 40 years, serving 26 counties from Hamilton 
County to Johnson County. LAET has six offices with locations in Chattanooga, 
Maryville, Johnson City, Morristown, and two offices in Knoxville (Family Justice 
Center  and  LAET  office).  There  are  Pro  Bono  Directors  in  the  Knoxville  and 
Chattanooga offices.  
 

•  Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands (LAS): LAS serves 
48  Tennessee  counties  with  its  eight  offices:  Clarksville,  Columbia,  Cookeville, 
Gallatin,  Murfreesboro,  Nashville,  Oak  Ridge,  and  Tullahoma.  To  qualify  for 
assistance 
the 
Cumberlands,  clients  must  be  at  least  60  years  of  age  or  from  a  low-income 
household. People living outside the Nashville office’s service area are instructed 
to  call  the  LAS  office  serving  their  county  to  find  out  about  pro  bono 
opportunities. LAS has a full-time Pro Bono Director in the Nashville office.

•  West Tennessee Legal Services (WTLS): WTLS serves Benton, Carroll, Chester, 
Crockett,  Dyer,  Decatur,  Gibson,  Hardeman,  Hardin,  Haywood,  Henry, 
Henderson,  Lake,  McNairy,  Madison,  Obion,  and  Weakley  counties.  Its  main 
office  is  in  Jackson,  with  offices  in  Dyersburg,  Huntingdon,  and  Selmer.  It  has 
one part-time Pro Bono Director/Coordinator. WTLS accepts the following types 
of  civil  cases:  access  to  health/medical  care,  securing  or  retaining  housing, 
ensuring  compliance  with  Fair  Housing  Laws,  securing  or  retaining  income, 
personal  freedom  and  security  rights,  parental  rights  with  state  action,  rights  of 
persons  in  institutions,  freedom  of  all  persons  from  abuse,  family  issues, 
education  rights,  consumer  rights,  and  community  education.  WTLS  does  not 
accept  cases  with  the  potential  of  a  high  monetary  judgment  or  adult  criminal 
cases. 

Legal Service Providers – Non-LSC-Funded 

In Tennessee, there are many legal service providers that do not receive funding from 
the  Legal  Services  Corporation.  The  Tennessee  Access  to  Justice  Commission 
considers  any  organization  that  does  not  receive  funding  from  the  Legal  Services 
Corporation  a  non-LSC-funded  legal  service  provider.  Non-LSC-funded  organizations 
can  serve  segments  of  the  population  and  handle  legal  matters  that  LSC-funded 
providers  cannot.  Non-LSC-funded  organizations  do  not  have  to follow  federal  income 
guidelines to determine if a person is eligible to receive legal services.  

The Commission has gathered data from the following non-LSC providers:, Community 
Legal Center, Disability Law & Advocacy Center, Southeast Tennessee Legal Services, 
Southern  Migrant  Legal  Services,  Tennessee  Coalition  to  End  Domestic  and  Sexual 
Violence,  the  Tennessee  Justice  Center,  and  Tennessee  Volunteer  Lawyers  and 
Professionals  for  the  Arts.  A  chart  detailing  the  pro  bono  opportunities  and  pro  bono 
statistics of each provider is attached as Exhibit C. 

ennessee Faith & Justice Alliance Members   

he Tennessee  Faith and  Justice  Alliance  (TFJA)  is  a program  developed by  the ATJ 
Commission to support and encourage faith-based groups in Tennessee who commit to 
providing  legal  resources  to  their  congregations  and  communities.    It’s  one  of  the  first 
programs of its kind in the country created to align needs seen at the local church level 

    T

with  possible  legal  resources  that  are  nearby,  perhaps  even  within  the  same 
congregation.  The notion is to connect with people in need in a place they already go to 
seek help with a problem. That place is quite often their place of worship. 

he  pilot  project  involved  the  Tennessee  Conference  of  the  United  Methodist  Church. 
Church  leaders  and  volunteer  attorneys  gathered  to  learn  more  about  the  program, 
assign attorneys to congregations, and receive training on how the program works. The 
United Methodist Church’s TFJA project is designed to pair an attorney with a place of 
worship.  When  a  leader  or  clergy  member  of  that  congregation  learns  of  a  member’s 
legal  need,  that  leader  can  then  refer  the  person  to  the  local  attorney  who  has 
volunteered  to  serve  as  a  resource  to  that  congregation.  That  attorney  in  turn  will 
provide  the  legal  advice  needed,  or  make  connections  with  other  resources  that  can 
provide the necessary services.  

he TFJA program, which has plans to expand to all faiths and geographic areas of the 
state,  is  flexible  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  particular  community.  The  UMC  model  is  just 
one  way  to  offer  services.  Other  organizations  may  consider  monthly  legal  clinics  or 
other offerings.  For example, a church in Nashville organized legal teams that partner 
with  addiction  rehabilitation  organizations.    These  legal  teams  work  with  program 
graduates to deal with outstanding legal issues that may impede the graduates’ success 
after  their  rehabilitation.    Another  example  is  a  clinic  started  at Lipscomb  University,  a 
Christian  institution.    The  Lipscomb  Institute  for  Law,  Justice  and  Society  recruited 
alumni  attorneys  to  serve  at  bi-monthly  free  walk-in  legal  clinics.    The  Pro  Bono 
Coordinator surveyed member organizations of the TFJA about the pro bono initiatives 
and efforts sponsored by each organization.  A chart containing information about each 
TFJA member, including its pro bono statistics, is attached as Exhibit D. 

FJA Survey Highlights 

•  Compassionate  Counsel,  a  501(c)(3)  organization  based  out  of  Nashville, 
operated  legal  clinics  in  Davidson  County  and  serve  clients  who  contact  them 
directly with civil legal issues.   
 

•  Cross  Point  Church  Legal  Program  has  twenty-five  volunteers  and  served  over 
twenty clients during its first two legal clinics.  The Church also has Legal Teams 
that  partner  with  addiction  rehabilitation  organizations  and  work  with  program 
graduates to deal with outstanding legal issues that may impede the graduates’ 
success after rehabilitation.

Law Offices with Pro Bono Policies 

or the first time, law offices that have adopted pro bono policies were surveyed for the 
annual pro bono report.  As part of its 2012 Strategic Plan, the Commission set a goal to 
increase  the  number  of  law  offices  with  pro  bono  policies  by  fifteen.    When  the 
Commission  set  this  goal,  there  were  approximately  fifty  law  offices  across  the  state 
with  pro  bono  policies.    As  of  December  31,  2013,  sixty-six  law  offices  in  Tennessee 
have  adopted  pro  bono  policies.    The  Pro  Bono  Coordinator  surveyed  the  law  offices 
with pro bono policies and seventeen law offices responded to the survey.

Supreme Court Rule 31 Mediator Pro Bono and Mediation Center Pro Bono 

Supreme  Court  Rule  31  is  a  system  where  litigants,  courts,  and  attorneys  can  locate 
qualified  alternative  dispute  resolution  mediators  and  other  neutrals  and  enlist  their 
assistance in resolving matters pending before courts of record.  Rule 31 does not affect 
dispute  resolution  programs  or  individual  cases  that  are  resolved  outside  the  Rule  31 
system.  The Rule was set up to assist the court in obtaining a mediator or other neutral 
when  the  court  or  the  parties  want  one.    Rule  31  also  established  the  Alternative 
Dispute Resolution Commission that devised a way that ADR neutrals could be trained 
and approved for use by the courts.  The Rule provides required credentials and training 
for  mediators  who  wish  to  be  listed  as  a  Supreme  Court  Rule  31  Mediator.    Rule  31

Mediators  are  required  to  file  a  report  after  every  mediation  they  conduct  providing 
general information on the mediation.  The mediator must report whether the mediation 
was  done  pro  bono.    In  2013,  Rule  31  Mediators  reported  conducting  350  pro  bono 
mediations.  There were four additional court-ordered pro bono mediations reported in 
2013.        

In  Tennessee,  some  counties  have  mediation  centers  offering  free  or  reduced-fee 
mediation services to people who cannot afford a mediator. The Administrative Office of 
the  Courts  has  limited  funding from  the  General  Assembly  to  assist  mediation centers 
that  apply  for  and  meet  grant  criteria.  The  grants  are  designed  to  help  low-income 
Tennesseans access mediation services. 

The  Commission  has  gathered  data  from  the  following  mediation  center  providers: 
Community  Mediation  Center,  Family  Court  Services  of  East  Tennessee,  Nashville 
Conflict  Resolution  Center,  Southeast  Tennessee  Human  Resources  Agency,  The 
Mediation Center (Columbia).

believe that this program has been greatly 
successful and the libraries and their staff have been 
great to work with. The libraries have also expressed 
great appreciation as they have indicated to us that 
they receive numerous legal questions.  

•  We are also seeing that many more questions on

hope that is in some part due to the young lawyers

•  As for wills for heroes, we have already prepared 
close to 300 free estate planning documents to 
heroes and their families. Young lawyers are also 
encouraged this year to volunteer at pro bono clinics 
and to take pro bono representation from their local 
legal aid offices. We do know of regular clinics being 
promoted and organized by TBA YLD member

brochures, and posters to these libraries 
and also sitting down to train the libraries 
on how each of these programs work and 
to answer any questions that they may 
have. In my experience, we have also had 
persons at the library who were interested 
and we walked them through the online 
justice site along with the LIFT website 
and they were very happy to have access 
to these forms of pro bono legal 
assistance. It is our goal to have trained 
one library in each county on these pro 
bono resources prior to June of 2014. We 
hope that this work lays the foundation for 
years to come for pro bono legal 
resources in libraries across the state. I 
would be amiss not to mention the work of 
the librarians in implementing this project. 
They have been more than helpful and 
excited to learn about these resources 
and to educate the public about them as 
well.

Barristers (Young Lawyer Division of the Knoxville Bar

Through 2013, each of the 8 offices of LAS managed 
its pro bono program separately. In the 7 offices 
outside of Nashville, staff identified cases for which no 
staff resources were available and which appropriate 
for referral to pro bono lawyers. In our Murfreesboro 
office LAS staff worked with pro bono lawyers at a 
weekly legal advice clinic and in Oak Ridge a monthly 
legal advice clinic was established where pro bono 
lawyers worked with UT law students to provide legal 
help.  

For Davidson and Williamson Counties, the Nashville 
Pro Bono Program administered the pro bono work. 
Clients were identified through referrals from the LAS 
staff, intake in substantive areas law not routinely 
handled by staff at LAS, referrals from partner 
agencies including the YW, Nashville Financial 
Empowerment Center and Catholic Charities, and 
attendance at legal advice clinics.

Beginning in January 2014, the Nashville 
Pro Bono program was dissolved and 
LAS established a regional Volunteer 
Lawyers Program. LAS staff has been 
working to identify significant unmet legal 
needs of clients which LAS does not 
have staff resources to address. LAS is 
developing strategies to meet these 
needs building on the Pillar Firm Model 
and creating an Urban-Rural Initiative. 

There is one urban-rural partnership in 
place already to provide legal help to 
clients in rural counties served by LAS’ 
Gallatin office. Other projects include 
both extending help throughout the

•  We provide civil legal services to the"working poor", 
people whose income falls between 125% of poverty 
and a living wage for Memphis. We also do immigration 
work for people in the jurisdiction of the immigration 
court in Memphis (TN, AR, N MS, W KY) whose 
income falls below 125% of poverty. 

•  We specialize in family law, consumer, debt collection, 
immigration, landlord tenant, advanced directives, 
probate, conservatorships 

• 

In addition to our regular ongoing program of assigning 
clients to pro bono attorneys to represent them, we 
participated in the University of Memphis Law School's 
Alternative Spring Break program for the 3rd year. We 
conducted both the family law tract in which law 
students worked with over 20 divorce litigants who 
eventually filed for pro se divorces and the Immigrant 
Justice Program of the CLC worked with 6 law students 
to file 23 DACA applications which are still being 
approved. 

•  We plan to continue the two pro bono 
projects we have currently. In the 13 
years I've been at CLC we have seen 
the number of cases we assign grow 
from an average of 6 per month to a 
current average of 28 total cases per 
month, with 10 - 12 of these 28 being 
assigned to pro bono attorneys. There 
are new programs in place to provide 
referrals and advice, but we see a 
continuing need for representation. 
Therefore, our emphasis in on continuing 
our primary pro bono project of assigning 
attorneys to cases and even increase the 
number of clients we are able to serve 
through it. 

•  ATJC: We appreciate the work that you 
are doing. I have served on the state 
Access to Justice Committee for 
approximately 9 years and we have 
struggled with a number of issues such 
as trying to get attorneys to do pro bono 
work. In the short time the Commission 
has been in existence, it has expedited 
this process by quantum leaps. With this 
and other issues, it makes such a great 
difference for people with the clout the 
Commission has to champion access to 
justice causes. From my perception, this 
model of having the Commission 
advocate for access to justice for the 
poor is moving us forward rapidly.

2013. In general, we have been unsuccessful in finding 
pro bono attorneys who can do the type of 
work/representation we'd need to serve our clients 
more effectively 

victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, 
and trafficking. We help our clients with immigration 
status based on their abuse situation. Our sexual 
assault clinic helps sexual assault victims with virtually 
any legal issue related to the sexual assault. These 
legal issues include housing, divorce, custody, 
consumer, and other matters.

The VLPA program provides pro bono legal assistance 
and education to low-income artists of all disciplines 
and emerging non-profit arts organizations in the 
greater Nashville area. We work to ensure access to 
effective legal counsel for artists and arts organizations 
with limited resources, to educate the community on 
arts-related business and legal issues, and to foster 
and strengthen cooperative relationships between the 
creative and legal communities. 

•  Had two clinics this year and used our pro bono 
volunteers to help clients with their cases.  

•  Future plans: possibly additional 
clinics both in Nashville and 
Chattanooga 

•  Needs: A grant to pay travel expenses 
for volunteers to go training and host 
clinics in other cities. For example, 
Chattanooga has the client needs and 
lawyers willing to volunteer, but need 
arts-specific training. We do not have the 
budget to pay for transportation to get 
our volunteers there and not all can pay 
out-of-pocket. 

 

     

They operate legal clinics out of the Nashville 
Rescue Mission as well as serve clients who 
contact them with civil legal issues. 

Also, Legal Teams from Cross Point Church in 
Nashville partner with addiction rehabilitation 
organizations.  The legal teams work with 
program graduates to deal with outstanding 
legal issues that may impede the graduates’ 
success after their rehabilitation. The legal 
teams are comprised of lawyers and law 
students who attend Cross Point.  The law 
students complete client intake, do legal 
research and draft motions, while the attorney 
oversee their work.  This allows the law 
students to get hands-on experience, and 
makes the time commitment for the attorneys 
more manageable.  

So far they gone through one round of Mending 
Hearts court cost forgiveness hearings.  During 
the first round, they have over $20,000 of court 
costs for 4 clients completely forgiven!

In order to grow, we need to recruit more attorneys in 
2014.  We also need to get the word out to more UMC 
churches in Nashville so that more pastors will refer 
clients to the program.  

2013 Pro Bono Report  
 

The UMC Initiative is composed of lawyers 
within local congregations who have committed 
to work with the pro bono legal issues that 
come to the attention of the local clergy. From 
now on, when a legal need arises within the 
church, it will no longer be the job of the church 
staff to find the appropriate resources to meet 
that need, but instead you will assume that 
referral role. Once you receive a referral from 
your local pastor, it is then your responsibility to 
either take the case or refer the case to the 
appropriate resource.

We have been providing free service for

Volunteers contribute to our Victim 
Offender Reconciliation Program 
mediations. These mediations are 
conducted at no expense to the parties 
or the courts. Volunteers also assist 
with general staff and fundraising 
needs; these efforts indirectly benefit all 
reduced-fee and free mediations. 

We are creating a program 
where we partner with our 
local Legal Aid office to 
provide limited scope 
representation and mediation 
services to pro se litigants in 
Chancery and Juvenile Court. 
We foresee the need for both 
volunteer attorneys and 
mediators. 

We need local and state courts to 
advocate on behalf of mediation. We 
don't have the marketing resources to 
reach out and educate the lay individual 
on the benefits of mediation and how it 
can contribute access to justice. 

Mediation can play a larger role in 
enhancing access to justice. A big help 
would be the creation and approval of 
divorce forms that expand on the Agreed 
Divorce forms already issued. The 
Agreed Divorce forms are a great step 
forward, however they are extremely 
limited.

Nashville Conflict 
Resolution Center 

2013 Pro Bono Report  
 

NCRC provides high-quality and 
affordable mediation services, conflict 
resolution education and training to 
diverse communities in Nashville. 

Prisoner re-entry 
mediation (for formerly 
incarcerated persons and 
their families) 

Volunteers were involved in all 7 of 
NCRC programs: 1) Victim Offender 
Mediation for Adults 2) Victim Offender 
Mediation for Juveniles 3) Civil 
Mediation (in General Sessions Court) 
4) Family Mediation (for never-married 
parents in Juvenile Court) 5) 
Community Mediation (all self-referrals) 
6) Bilingual Mediation (for the Hispanic 
community) 7) 'Planting Seeds' Peer 
Mediation training (in Metro Nashville 
public high schools) 

I would like the ATJ Commission to 
do a better job of promoting pro 
bono mediation and Tennessee's 
non-profit community mediation 
centers, advocating for more support 
from the Judiciary so that the 
centers can have wide-scale impact 
on low-income residents in 
Tennessee. (Legal aid agencies 
receive a great deal more state 
funding, for example.) I request that 
the ATJ Commission emphasize in 
the Annual Report that participation 
in pro bono mediation services 
(either through a community 
mediation center or as a solo 
practitioner) earns attorney-
mediators free CLE credit (per 
Supreme Court Rule 21, Section 
4.07(c) and OUTLINE the steps that 
attorney-mediators must take to 
receive that credit. I am certain that 
attorney-mediators either do not 
know about this or are resistant to 
engaging in pro bono mediation 
because of a desire to benefit 
financially from mediation practice. 
The ATJ Commission should be the 
leader of public discourse on pro 
bono mediation, pushing for 
incentives that will encourage ease 
of participation. Otherwise, what 
momentum is there to truly serve the 
poor??
