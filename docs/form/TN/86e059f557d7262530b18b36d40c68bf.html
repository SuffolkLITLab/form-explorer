OPINION

Facts

According  to  the  Board  of  Probation  and  Parole’s  “Probation  Order,” Defendant 
was convicted on October 16, 2020,1 of aggravated assault and sentenced to three years to 
be served on probation.  On September 23, 2021, the Tennessee Department of Correction 
                                           

1 The record does not contain a judgment of conviction, and the Probation Order relates only to 

case number 20-01880.  

03/23/2023filed  a  Petition  for  Revocation  of  Suspension  of  Sentence2 (“the  Petition”)  alleging  that 
Defendant had violated conditions of probation in the following manner: (1) that Defendant 
had “open warrants” issued on May 14, 2021, for unlawful possession of a weapon and 
July 18, 2021, for attempted first degree  murder and employing a firearm with intent to 
commit a felony; (2) that Defendant failed to obtain lawful employment; (3) that Defendant
failed to report to his probation officer; (4) that Defendant failed to provide a current and 
valid address; and (5) that Defendant had contact with one of the victims of the aggravated 
assault.  

On  April  11,  2022,  the  court  held  a  revocation  hearing,  at  which  Defendant  was 

represented by an Assistant Public Defender (“Assistant PD”).  

The State called as a witness, Ianesha White, a “probation officer 2” with the State 
Department  of  Correction,  Probation  and  Parole,  who  served  as  “an  intake  probation 
officer, supervising and monitoring offenders,” including Defendant.  Ms. White testified 
that Defendant “reported as instructed” at the “Crump location,” until he “caught the new 
arrest” on June 7, 2021.  She testified that she had no contact with Defendant after April 
2021, despite attempts to contact him through home visits on June 14 and 16 and by phone
on June 19.  

During  cross-examination,  the  Assistant  PD asked  Ms.  White about  an  apparent 
typographical mistake on Defendant’s arrest warrant, and the prosecutor objected that the 
question  was  “outside  the  bounds  of  the  absconsion.”    The  trial  court  sustained  the 
objection, ruling that it was “irrelevant” “to whether or not [Defendant] absconded[.]”  The 
following exchange occurred:

[Assistant PD]:  . . . Judge, correct me if I’m wrong . . . we’re not going to 
talk about the basis number – how he violated Rule Number One with open 
warrants because those are not – that’s not relevant to the hearing today.

THE COURT:  Not unless you want to make it relevant.  It’s not relevant.  
She’s called to the stand for what reason, State?  So he absconded?

[Prosecutor]:  Testify about the absconsion.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So that’s what they’re particularly keying on.  

The  Assistant  PD asked  Ms.  White about  Defendant’s  failure  to  obtain  lawful 
employment, and she stated that Defendant had not provided any proof of employment and 

                                           

2 The petition relates to case numbers 20-01880 and C2003232.

had been referred to an “employment specialist.”  The Assistant PD then began to ask about 
Defendant’s arrest for unlawful possession of a weapon but prefaced the question with a 
question  to  the  court  about  whether  the  court  would  consider  the  testimony.    Then  the 
following exchange occurred:  

THE COURT:  I don’t know how much – how many times I have to say it.  
I’m not going to consider anything except the fact that he absconded.

[Assistant PD]:  Well, Judge, we –

THE COURT:  Okay, so if he hadn’t absconded –

[Assistant PD]:  – have you already concluded that he absconded?  Because 
I haven’t even finished my cross.  

THE  COURT:    Please  stop  arguing  with  me.    Please  just  talk  about  the 
absconsion.  If you have proof that he didn’t abscond let’s hear it.

[Assistant PD]:  The burden is on the State, Judge.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  And they’ve made their – they’ve proved their case.  
I’m just waiting for you to finish up this cross-examination.  

[Assistant PD]:  So you’ve already made a decision?

THE  COURT:    I  mean,  if  you  have  proof  that  he  didn’t  abscond,  you’re 
welcome to put it on.  Right now, there’s proof in the – in this record by a 
preponderance of the evidence that he has absconded.  So you can go on and 
on about his arrests or other things.  

[Assistant PD]:  I don’t want to go on about his other arrests –

THE COURT:  Yeah.  I don’t know why you are.  

[Assistant PD]:  – if you’re not going to consider them.  Because they’re in 
the affidavit of complaint.  

THE COURT:  You keep talking about it and I told you I wasn’t going to 
consider it.  

[Assistant PD]:  Yes.

THE COURT:  So, please, ask a relevant question.  

The Assistant PD asked about Defendant’s failure to provide an updated address, 
and Ms. White acknowledged that Defendant had been living on “Loch Lomore” but that 
the Petition stated “Loch Lomond.”  She explained, “It runs into the same street though.  
Like, his front door faces Loch Lomond, but the house is on Loch Lomore, so, yeah.”  She 
agreed that she attempted home visits over one week in June 2021 and that Defendant had 
been reporting regularly prior to that.  At one of the unsuccessful home visits, Defendant’s 
mother answered the door and stated that he no longer lived there.  On June 23, 2021, the 
probation officer “ran a CLEAR report” to find any new contact information for Defendant.  
Ms. White made a “few more” attempts to contact Defendant in July 2021 by sending him 
letters, but at that point, Ms. White was “over-supervising” Defendant.  

Near the conclusion of Ms. White’s testimony, the trial court asked the  Assistant 
PD, “is there anymore new information you wish to glean from this witness (Ms.White)?”  
When the Assistant PD responded in the affirmative, the trial court responded:

THE COURT:  Because I think [Ms. White] needs to go back to work.  We 
have  a  courtroom  specialist  who’s  supposed  to  be  taking  this,  doing  the 
testimony, but you’ve wasted this – you’re supposed to be calling on people 
right now; right?

[Ms. White]:  I’m supposed to be doing home visits, right now.

THE COURT:  Right. Okay.  So you’re keeping her from her job.  Do you 
have any more relevant questions?

[Assistant PD]:  I do, Judge.

THE COURT:  Pardon?

[Assistant PD]:  I do. 

THE COURT: Just say one of them, please.

The trial court then asked Ms. White “where was [Defendant] arrested?”  Ms. White 
responded, “I’m not sure.”  The trial court then responded  “Oh.  It was Desoto County, 

Mississippi.”3 The court then asked Ms. White if Defendant had her permission to go to 
Mississippi and she responded he did not.  The Assistant PD then stated to Ms. White “you 
never had any reason to believe that [Defendant] left Shelby County; correct?”  Ms. White 
responded, “correct.”  The trial court then offered, “and that’s because he didn’t tell you, 
did he,” to which Ms. White responded, “right.”  The trial court then thanked the Assistant 
PD for “pointing that out.”

Before  inquiring  whether  Defendant  chose  to testify  or  present  any  evidence,  the 
trial court found simply, “by a preponderance of the evidence he has violated probation.”  
The  court  did  not  state  the  reasons  for  its  finding  or  the  basis  on  which  it  found  that 
Defendant violated his probation.

Turning  to  the  consequences  of  Defendant’s  violation,  the  trial  court  asked  the 
Assistant PD, “do you wish to put on any proof that I should reprobate him or something 
to that effect?”  After a recess, the Assistant PD stated that Defendant chose not to testify, 
and the trial court heard arguments of counsel.  The State argued that the preponderance of 
the evidence showed that Defendant absconded from supervised probation.  The Assistant 
PD argued  that  there  were  only  “two  possible  bases  for  violation  today.    The  failure  to 
maintain lawful employment and the change  of address.”  She argued that “more than a 
mere failure to report” was required to establish Defendant absconded and that it was not 
one of the grounds alleged in the Petition.  The trial court found the “arrest ticket,” which 
stated that Defendant was arrested in Desoto County, Mississippi was sufficient notice to 
Defendant of the alleged ground of absconding to satisfy due process.  

The trial court found that Defendant “wasn’t supposed to be in Mississippi and that’s 
where he was.”  The court noted, “Incidentally, . . . you can’t give proof of employment 
unless you are reporting.  I can only surmise that he doesn’t have proof of employment.  
And . . . that’s a violation of probation.”  The court further found that there was no proof 
presented that Defendant “completed Rebuilding Mindsets,” which was a condition of his 
probation.  The court stated that “it would be an insult to the decent law-abiding citizens 
of  Shelby  County  to  reprobate  [Defendant]  for  no  reason  at  all.”    The  court  ordered 
Defendant to serve his original sentence in confinement.  Defendant timely appealed.  

                                           

3 Later during argument, while the Assistant PD was pointing out that Defendant had no notice that 
“anything had happened in Desoto County,” the trial court stated the “arrest ticket which is in the Court’s 
jacket said [Defendant] was arrested in Desoto County, Mississippi.”  The trial court then instructed the 
Assistant PD “so you should’ve been familiar with that.  But it is in the record, and I’ll take judicial notice 
that it’s in the record.”

Analysis

- 5 -

Defendant  asserts that  the  trial  court  abused  its  discretion  when  it  relied  on  his 
absconding, which was not alleged in the Petition, as the basis for the revocation; that the 
State failed to establish that Defendant absconded; and that the trial court failed to properly 
place its findings on the record.  The State responds that it gave proper notice of the grounds 
for  revocation,  that  the  proof  established  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that 
Defendant  absconded,  and  that  the  trial  court  sufficiently  stated  its  reasoning  for  the 
revocation and acted within its discretion.  

In State v. Dagnan, an opinion filed a little over a month before the violation hearing 
in  this  matter,  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  clarified  that  a  probation  revocation 
proceeding involves a two-step inquiry, both of which are distinct discretionary decisions 
that must be reviewed and addressed on appeal.  641 S.W.3d 751, 757-58 (Tenn. 2022).  
“If the trial judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has violated 
the  conditions  of  probation  and  suspension  of  sentence,  then  the  court  may  revoke  the 
defendant’s probation and suspension of sentence, in full or in part, pursuant to § 40-35-
310.”  T.C.A. § 40-35-311.  Upon finding that a defendant violated the terms of his or her 
probation,  a  trial  court  “must  determine  (1)  whether  to  revoke  probation,  and  (2)  the 
appropriate consequence to impose upon revocation.”  Dagnan, 641 S.W.3d at 753.  Once 
the trial court decides to revoke a defendant’s probation, it may (1) order confinement; (2) 
order the sentence into execution as initially entered; (3) return the defendant to probation 
on modified conditions as necessary; or (4) extend the probationary period by up to two 
years.  See State v. Hunter, 1 S.W.3d 643, 646-47 (Tenn. 1999); T.C.A. §§ 40-35-308, -
310, -311.

If the trial court “places sufficient findings and the reasons for its decisions as to the 
revocation and the consequence on the record,” the standard of review on appeal is abuse 
of discretion with a presumption of reasonableness.  Dagnan, 641 S.W.3d at 759.  As it 
relates to factual findings, “‘appellate courts cannot properly review a sentence if the trial 
court  fails  to  articulate  in  the  record  its  reasons  for  imposing  the  sentence.’” Id.  at  758 
(quoting State v. Bise, 380 S.W.3d 682, 705 n. 41 (Tenn. 2012)).  “It is not necessary for 
the trial court’s findings to be particularly lengthy or detailed but only sufficient for the 
appellate  court  to  conduct  a  meaningful  review  of  the  revocation  decision.”  Id.  (citing 
Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 705-06).  The appellate court may conduct a de novo review if a trial 
court fails to place sufficient reasoning for the probation revocation on the record and the 
record is sufficient for the court to do so.  Id. at 759 (citing State v. King, 432 S.W.3d 316, 
327-28 (Tenn. 2014)).  To establish an abuse of discretion, “there must be no substantial 
evidence to support the conclusion of the trial court that a violation of the conditions of 
probation has occurred.”  State v. Shaffer, 45 S.W.3d 553, 554 (Tenn. 2001) (citing State 
v. Harkins, 811 S.W.2d 79, 82 (Tenn. 1991)).

- 6 -

Here, the trial court did not  make sufficient findings to support the revocation of 
Defendant’s  probation  or  its  reasoning  for  imposing  incarceration  in  accordance  with 
Dagnan.    We  need  not  determine  whether  the  record  is  sufficient  to  conduct a  de  novo 
review, however, because we conclude that due process requires reversal because the trial 
court relied on absconding as a ground to revoke his probation without Defendant’s being 
noticed of that allegation in the probation violation warrant, and the error is not harmless.  

Minimum due process requires that written notice of claimed violations of probation 
be  disclosed  to  a  probationer.  Gagnon  v.  Scarpelli,  411  U.S.  778,  786  (1973)  (citation 
omitted).  Generally, revoking a defendant’s probation “based on grounds not alleged and 
noticed to the defendant is a violation of due process.”  State v. Chad Allen Conyers, No. 
E2004-00360-CCA-R3-CD, 2005 WL 551940, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 9, 2005), no 
perm. app. filed.  However, the error produced by a trial court’s partial reliance on a ground 
for revocation not noticed to the defendant is harmless “if the trial court also relied upon 
properly noticed grounds supported by the evidence.” State v. Christopher Roy McGill, 
No.  M2015-01929-CCA-R3-CD,  2016  WL  3947694,  at  *4  (Tenn.  Crim.  App.  July  18, 
2016) (citing State v. David W. Sonnemaker, No. E2003-01402-CCA-R3-CD, 2004 WL 
483239, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 12, 2004), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Oct. 11, 2004); 
State v. Ricky Davis, No. 03C01-9706-CC-00215, 1998 WL 205925, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. 
App. Apr. 29, 1998), no perm. app. filed), no perm. app. filed.

The State submits that the revocation warrant and petition for revocation fairly gave 
notice of the grounds for violation.  The State argues that the allegations that Defendant 
failed to report and failed to provide a current and valid address served as the bases for the 
violation,  which  the  court  “collectively”  labeled  “absconding,”  and  that  the  proof  was 
sufficient to support the trial court’s conclusion.  We disagree.  

This Court has previously recognized the definition of “abscond” as “[t]o  go in a 
clandestine  manner  out  of  the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts,  or  to  lie  concealed,  in  order  to 
avoid their process.  To hide, conceal, or absent oneself clandestinely, with the intent to 
avoid legal process.”  State v. Timothy Wakefield, No. W2003-00892-CCA-R3-CD, 2003 
WL 22848965, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 25, 2003) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 
8  (6th  ed.1990)),  no  perm.  app.  filed.   Furthermore,  absconding  is  specifically  excluded 
from technical violations, which include failure to report.  T.C.A. § 40-35-311(g).  

We conclude that the trial court erred by revoking Defendant’s probation based on 
a ground not alleged in the petition.  Furthermore, we cannot conclude that the error was 
harmless because the court did not rely on other grounds that were properly noticed.  At 
the revocation hearing, the State objected to cross-examination on any subject other than 
absconding, and the trial court insisted that absconding was the only issue before the court.

- 7 -

The  trial  court  severely  limited  the  Assistant  PD’s  cross-examination  of  the  probation 
officer.  

At  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  the  court  found  “[i]ncidentally”  that  Defendant 
had not presented proof of employment, a ground alleged in the petition, and that he had 
not presented proof that he completed “Rebuilding Mindsets,” a ground not alleged in the 
petition.  Based upon the trial court’s previous statements regarding the limiting nature of 
the proof to that of absconding, we are unable to reconcile this remark.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and this case is 

remanded for a new hearing.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
