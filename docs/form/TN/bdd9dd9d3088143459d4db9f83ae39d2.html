      <pre>Memorial Resolution 
Conrad E. Troutman, Jr. 

onrad E. Troutman, Jr., Circuit Court Judge of the Eighth Judicial District from 
1974 to 2004, passed away on November 27, 2019, at the age of 91. He was preceded 
in death by his parents, Con E. Troutman, Esquire, and Velma Davis Troutman, his 
son Richard Scott Troutman and brother Andy Troutman, esquire.  

e is survived by his wife of 61 years, Sue Byrd Troutman, son Mark Troutman, 
Esquire,  Chris  Troutman,  Reid  Troutman,  Esquire  and  Drew  Troutman.  Also 
surviving him are his brother, Dr. Gerald Troutman and sisters Jane Fox and Joan 
Abernathy along with fourteen grandchildren.  

udge Troutman was raised and educated in LaFollette, Tennessee. After graduating 
in 1946, he enrolled at the University of Tennessee where he was an active member 
of Sigma Chi fraternity. Upon graduation, he returned home and entered banking 
until  enlisting  into  the  United  States  Army,  rising  to  the  rank  of  First  Lieutenant 
while serving in the Korean War. When the conflict ended, he entered law school at 
the University of Tennessee. Upon completion of law school, he came back to his 
hometown and began practicing law with his father. During his years as a lawyer he 
served  his  community  in  countless  roles.  He  was  the  attorney  for  the  LaFollette 
Hospital  Board  of  Directors  throughout  the  construction  of  the  facility.  He  also 
served as Campbell County attorney, LaFollette Housing Authority Board attorney, 
and attorney for the Campbell County Board of Education, as well as beginning his 
long-time service on the Board of Directors at First National Bank. 

rom the beginning of his 30 years on the circuit bench, his talent for seeking justice 
and  reconciliation  between  disputing  parties  was  evident.  Cases  that  began  as 
contentious ended in mutual agreement, with all sides appreciating his ability to find 
the right result. His impact on the legal community in his five-county district will 
not be forgotten. Courtroom staff and lawyers all account for his patient and gentle 
demeanor, never raising his tone or voice but always maintaining command of any 
proceeding  along  with  the  respect  of  all  impacted.  Young  lawyers  in  particular 
sought his wise counsel for matters of all types, from personal advice to law practice 
questions. No one did more to promote the welfare of our profession.  
Outside the courtroom, Judge Troutman was the ever-present patriarch. His family 
always  received  first  priority,  from  the  grandchildren  who  loved  fishing  with 
“Judge” during retirement, to maintaining the closest ties to his children throughout

their personal and professional lives. He had great friends who shared his interests 
in  boating,  University  of  Tennessee  athletics  and  horse  racing.  His  church  was 
blessed by his heart for service, working on many boards and projects as a longtime 
member  of  LaFollette  United  Methodist  Church.  He  was  selected  by  the  South 
Campbell County Rotary Club as its Man of the Year in 2003.  

udge  Conrad  E.  Troutman,  Jr.  was  a  giant  to  his  family,  his  community  and  his 
profession. We are all better for having been in his presence.  

HEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Tennessee Judicial Conference on this 
20th  day  of  October,  2021,  that  Conrad  E.  Troutman,  Jr.  is  honored  with  this 
Resolution, which shall be entered in the minutes of this conference and that copies 
of this Resolution be given to the members of his family and to the West Publishing 
Company for publication in the Tennessee Decisions.  
Respectfully submitted on this 20th day of October 2021.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
