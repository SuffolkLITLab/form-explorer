PAUL ZACHARY MOSS v. SHELBY COUNTY CIVIL SERVICE MERIT 
BOARD

Appeal by Permission from the Court of Appeals
Chancery Court for Shelby County

No. CH-15-1669

JoeDae L. Jenkins, Chancellor

___________________________________

No. W2017-01813-SC-R11-CV
__________________________________

The issue presented is whether a civil service merit board acts arbitrarily or capriciously
by not allowing an employee to ask questions in a termination hearing about more lenient
discipline  imposed  on  other civil  service  employees.  A  Shelby  County  Fire  Department 
employee  was  fired  based  on  his  participation  in  an  altercation  involving  a firearm  at  a 
political  rally and his  dishonesty  during  the  subsequent  investigation.  He appealed  his 
termination to the Shelby County Civil Service Merit Board. During the hearing, the Board 
did not allow the employee’s counsel to ask questions about discipline imposed on other 
Fire Department employees. The Board affirmed the employee’s termination for just cause.
The  employee  appealed,  and  the  trial  court  affirmed.  The  Court  of  Appeals  reversed, 
holding  that  the  Board’s  decision  to  exclude  the  questions  about  other  discipline  was 
arbitrary  and  unreasonable, and  remanded the  case  for  consideration  of  such  evidence. 
Under the narrow standard of review provided in the Uniform Administrative Procedures 
Act, we hold that the Board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously by declining to consider 
evidence  of  discipline  imposed  on  other  employees. We reverse  the  Court  of  Appeals’ 
judgment and affirm the judgment of the trial court.

OPINION

I.

November 2013 Incident

On  November  1,  2013,  several individuals  held a  political  rally  on  an  interstate 
overpass in Memphis. Rally participants held signs that advocated for the impeachment of 
then-President Barack Obama, and at least one individual wore a plastic mask depicting 
President Obama. Passing motorists reacted negatively to the demonstration. Fearful of the 
possibility of violence, participants called the Memphis Police Department (“MPD”) for 
assistance.

Paul Zachary Moss arrived at the overpass after his wife, a rally attendee, said she 
feared for her safety. Mr. Moss approached the scene armed with a .38 caliber handgun. 
Upon learning that an attendee, Thomas Mason Ezzell, Jr., wore the “Obama mask,” Mr. 
Moss became angry. The situation escalated into a physical altercation between Mr. Moss, 
Mr.  Ezzell,  and  another  rally  attendee,  Earl Mayfield. Mr.  Moss  pointed his  handgun  at 
both men, threatening to kill them. Mr. Ezzell and Mr. Mayfield relented, and Mr. Moss 
returned  to  his  truck  where  he  was  disarmed  and  arrested  by  MPD  officers. Mr.  Moss 
informed the Fire Department about the incident.

Later,  a  grand  jury  indicted  Mr.  Moss  on  two  counts  of  aggravated  assault.  He 
entered an Alford plea to one count of aggravated assault.1 After successfully completing
three years of judicial diversion, the diverted charge was dismissed. See Tenn. Code Ann. 
§ 40-35-313(a)(2) (2010 & Supp. 2013). 

                                           

1 An  Alford  or  best  interest  plea  allows  a  defendant  to  concede  that  the  prosecution’s  evidence 
would likely result in a conviction without admitting to the charged offense. North Carolina v. Alford, 400 
U.S. 25, 37 (1970).

Employment Termination

After Mr. Moss entered the plea, Fire Department Deputy Chief Dale Burress sent 
Mr.  Moss  a  Loudermill  notice,2 advising  him  of  the  possibility  of  major  discipline, 
including termination, on two grounds: conviction of a felony and conduct “in violation of 
Shelby County Policies, procedures or regulations.” Fire Department Chief Alvin Benson 
and Deputy Chief Burress held a Loudermill hearing with Mr. Moss to discuss the charges 
and possible discipline. Mr. Moss told them that during the November 2013 altercation, 
Mr.  Ezzell  confronted  him  first, but  Mr.  Moss  had  continued  the  conversation  after  Mr. 
Ezzell walked away. Mr. Moss denied he had been drinking but admitted to pointing his 
gun at Mr. Ezzell and Mr. Mayfield. Mr. Moss admitted he had previously been arrested 
for possession of a firearm but denied alcohol had been involved. Mr. Moss denied he had 
assaulted a woman. However, police records showed that in March 2011, Mr. Moss was 
arrested  on  charges  of  public  intoxication  and  possession  of  a  firearm  while  under  the 
influence  of  alcohol. Police  records  also  showed  that  in  October  2012,  a  police  officer 
responded  to  a  domestic  violence  call  during  which  Mrs.  Moss  stated  Mr.  Moss  had 
assaulted her.

After  the  Loudermill hearing, Chief  Benson  notified  Mr.  Moss  by  letter  that  his 
employment  was  terminated.  The  letter  cited Mr.  Moss’s actions  at  the  November  2013 
rally and subsequent legal proceedings, as well as his “vague and in some cases deceptive 
and/or untrue” statements made at the Loudermill hearing,3 including:





Mr. Moss claimed that he only intended to escort his wife from the 
rally,  but  Mr.  Moss  “confronted  protesters,  engaged  in  a  fight, and 
attempted to leave” without his wife;

Mr.  Moss  denied  that  he  “intended  to  personally  settle  the 
disturbance,”  but  he  was  confrontational  and  his  actions  indicated 
extremely aggressive behavior and “hot-temperedness”;

                                           

2 In Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, the United States Supreme Court held that the 
Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution entitle a 
“tenured public employee . . . to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the 
employer’s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.” 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). Mr. 
Moss was a classified Shelby County employee and was thus entitled to notice before termination “[f]or 
unsatisfactory performance of duties or other just cause.” Act of May 6, 1971, ch. 110, § 22, 1971 Tenn. 
Priv. Acts 493, 504–05.

3 Under the Fire Department’s general rules of conduct, “[r]efusal of an employee to give complete 

and accurate information shall be grounds for disciplinary actions.”



Mr.  Moss  denied  he  had  been  drinking  alcohol  on  the  day  of  the 
altercation but told Deputy Chief Burress otherwise. Also, witnesses 
testified that Mr. Moss appeared to be “under the influence of alcohol 
and out of control”;

Mr. Moss denied confronting an upset woman at the rally but admitted 
in a written statement that he approached the  woman to try to calm 
her;

Mr.  Moss  denied  showing  aggression  toward  “the  man  with  the 
[former President Barack] Obama mask” but followed him, lunged at 
him, and ripped his shirt;

Mr. Moss admitted to a previous arrest for possession of a gun without 
a  permit  but  denied  the  police  report  account  that  alcohol  was 
involved; and

Mr. Moss denied being involved in a previous incident in which police 
responded to a call about Mr. Moss allegedly assaulting his wife.

Moss v. Shelby Cnty. Civ. Serv. Merit Bd., 597 S.W.3d 823, 825–26 (Tenn. 2020). Chief 
Benson ended his letter by summarizing the bases for his decision and notifying Mr. Moss 
that his employment was terminated because he had violated the applicable standards of 
personal conduct and behavior of Fire Department employees.

Administrative Review

Mr. Moss appealed his termination to the Shelby County Civil Service Merit Board 
(“Board”). The Board conducted a hearing, and witnesses included Mr. Mayfield, Chief 
Benson, Deputy Chief Burress, and Mr. Moss.4

Mr. Mayfield testified that on November 1, 2013, he and six or eight acquaintances 
gathered  at  the  interstate  overpass,  displaying  “an  anti-Obama  banner”  and  waving 
American  flags  to  the  motorists  below.  He  noted  that  various  passersby  voiced  their 
opinions at rally participants, including one woman who stopped her car “in the middle of 
the road and began haranguing [them] and insulting [them].” After the woman began taking 
                                           

4 Kenneth  Brashier,  Mr.  Moss’s  attorney,  also  testified  that  before  the  Loudermill  hearing,  he 
advised the Fire Department by letter that Mr. Moss’s Alford plea and subsequent judicial diversion did not 
constitute a conviction. Moss, 597 S.W.3d at 828.

pictures  of  rally  participants  and  making  phone  calls,  Mr.  Ezzell,  concerned  about  the 
possibility of violence, called the MPD and asked them to “send somebody over to provide 
some safety while [they] ended the rally.” Mr. Mayfield and Mr. Ezzell then returned to 
the parking lot near the overpass where their vehicles were parked. Mr. Mayfield testified 
that Mr. Moss began walking toward them “yelling that [they] were stupid and [they] were 
racists” and demanding to  know who wore the Obama  mask. When Mr. Ezzell told Mr. 
Moss  he  had  been  wearing  the  mask,  Mr.  Moss  continued  to  yell  at  the  two  men.  Mr. 
Mayfield observed that Mr. Moss appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Eventually, Mr. Moss lunged at Mr. Ezzell, leading Mr. Mayfield to grab Mr. Moss from 
behind. Mr. Moss broke loose from Mr. Mayfield’s grasp before “pointing a gun in [Mr. 
Mayfield’s] face and threatening to kill [him].” Mr. Moss then walked away from the two 
men. Another  rally  attendee  quickly  notified  the  arriving  MPD  officers  of  Mr.  Moss’s
actions, and Mr. Moss was arrested without incident. All three men were taken to the police 
station where Mr. Mayfield gave a written statement about the incident.

Chief  Benson  testified  that  after  the  Loudermill hearing and  based  on  a 
preponderance of the evidence, he concluded Mr. Moss was the primary aggressor in the 
November 2013 altercation, that he had threatened to use a firearm, and that he appeared 
to  have  been  under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  Chief  Benson  detailed  Mr.  Moss’s  prior 
behaviors,  including  a  2011  charge  for  public  intoxication  and  possession  of  a  firearm 
while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol and  his  involvement  in  a  2012  domestic  assault 
incident. The Fire Department had no record of Mr. Moss reporting either incident to his 
superiors.

Chief Benson explained he had a uniform policy for handling discipline. He stated
he would terminate a firefighter who was under the influence and had a weapon to be used 
against a citizen. Chief Benson also noted he handled the incident involving Mr. Moss in 
the same way he would have responded to a similar instance involving another employee.

During  cross-examination,  counsel  for  Mr.  Moss  attempted  to  question  Chief 
Benson about whether he had uniformly applied this policy to prior disciplinary incidents,
specifically  asking  about  a firefighter  who  had  committed sexual  assault. Chief  Benson 
testified  that  “a  firefighter  who  committed  sexual  battery  would  likely  be  terminated.” 
Moss  v.  Shelby  Cnty.  Civ.  Serv.  Merit  Bd.,  No.  W2017-01813-COA-R3-CV,  2021  WL 
4786370, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 14, 2021), perm. app. granted (Tenn. Mar. 25, 2022).
When Mr. Moss’s attorney asked Chief Benson why he had not terminated that particular 
firefighter, counsel for the Fire Department objected to the line of questioning as irrelevant.
The  Board sustained the  objection and  declined to  hear  evidence  relating  to  the  prior 
discipline.

Deputy Chief Burress testified that Mr. Moss had pleaded guilty to a felony charge 
and  been  granted  diversion.  Thus,  under  Shelby  County  government  rules,  he  could  not 
continue  his  employment  after  pleading  guilty  to  a  felony.  Deputy  Chief  Burress  also 
described Mr. Moss’s untruthful answers to questions during the Loudermill hearing about 
the 2011 and 2012 incidents and his failure to report these incidents to his superiors.

Finally,  Mr.  Moss  testified  about  his  employment  with  the  Fire  Department,  his 

prior encounters with law enforcement, and the November 2013 incident:

Mr. Moss testified that he began working as a firefighter with the Fire 
Department in October 2007, after about five years with the Memphis Fire 
Department.  Mr.  Moss  explained  that  after  his  2011  arrest  for  public 
intoxication  and  possession  of  a  firearm,  he  reported  the  arrest  to  his 
superiors, explaining that he had been arrested after a sleepwalking incident 
caused  by  taking  prescribed  medication.  Mr.  Moss  maintained  that  no 
alcohol  was  involved,  that  all  charges  were  dismissed,  and  that  the  Fire 
Department brought no disciplinary charges against him. He admitted he had 
no documentation showing that the meeting with his superiors took place and 
that he had no permit for the firearm he was carrying. As to the 2012 domestic 
violence  incident,  Mr.  Moss  said  he  was  not  present  when  the  police 
responded to his wife’s call and did not know there was a police report about 
the call.

Mr. Moss then explained that on November 1, 2013, he was at home 
when his wife called and asked him to meet her at a political rally because 
she was feeling threatened. Mr. Moss denied consuming alcohol that day. He 
stated that when he arrived at the event, he approached a woman on the street 
who told him she was angry because white men were wearing “black-men” 
masks. The police arrived moments later, and the woman went to talk to the 
police. Mr. Moss then spoke with a former coworker, who told him someone 
had mentioned doing a “drive-by” shooting. Mr. Moss went to a parking lot 
to speak to the event participants and to ask his wife why she was at the rally 
with  the  men  wearing  “black-men”  masks.  According  to  Mr.  Moss,  Mr. 
Ezzell then walked over and said he was the person wearing the  “Obama” 
mask. Mr. Moss said he became upset and yelled at Mr. Ezzell because Mr. 
Moss’s  wife  had  been  put  in  a  dangerous  situation.  He  admitted  saying  to 
Mr. Ezzell, “Are you stupid?” He also acknowledged that he was “trying to 
be  heard,”  but  denied  swinging  at,  grabbing,  or  punching  Mr.  Ezzell.  Mr. 
Moss explained that Mr. Mayfield hit him from behind and put him on the 
ground in a headlock, and Mr. Ezzell tried to grab his arms. When Mr. Moss 

- 6 -

freed himself, he pulled his gun because he felt he was in imminent danger. 
The police arrested Mr. Moss and took him to the police station. After his 
release, Mr. Moss reported his arrest to his battalion chief. 

Mr. Moss said that he kept Deputy Chief Burress informed about the 
case and that Deputy Chief Burress recommended that he take the diversion 
as  “the  best  way  to  hold  on  to  [his]  job.”  Mr.  Moss  agreed  that  a  higher 
standard applies to firefighters than to the general public. He asserted that he 
did  not  make  a  “conscious  choice”  to take  his  gun  to  the  rally.  Mr.  Moss 
explained that because he always carries his gun, the gun was in his pocket 
when his wife called asking him to meet her.

Moss, 597 S.W.3d at 828 (alteration in original).

Based on this evidence, the Board found that Mr. Moss had been untruthful during 
the  Loudermill  hearing  and  had  “exhibited  conduct  unbecoming  of  a  Shelby  County 
Firefighter or Shelby County employee while off duty.” Further, the Board considered Mr. 
Moss’s completion of judicial diversion immaterial because “the fact is that the incident 
occurred  and  is  an  egregious  violation  of  the General  Rules  of  Conduct”  that  “reflected 
adversely on all firefighters.” Thus, the Board determined the Fire Department had met its 
burden of proof in showing Mr. Moss was fired for just cause.

Trial Court Review

Mr. Moss sought review of the Board’s termination decision in the Shelby County 
Chancery  Court. He  asserted,  among  other  things,  that  his  termination  violated  his 
procedural  due  process  rights  because  he  did not  receive  adequate  notice  of  the  charges 
against  him.  Mr.  Moss  also  argued  that  the  Board’s  decision  was  unsupported  by 
substantial and material evidence and was arbitrary and capricious.

The  trial  court  ruled  that  Mr.  Moss  had  adequate  notice of  the  reasons for  his 
termination and that the requirements of due process had been satisfied. It found substantial 
and material evidence supported the Board’s decision, including the testimony of multiple 
witnesses who confirmed Mr. Moss had violated applicable policies. The trial court also 
concluded  that  evidence  about  other  discipline  was  irrelevant to  the  inquiry  about  Mr. 
Moss’s conduct. Thus, the trial court affirmed the Board’s decision.

Appellate Review

Mr. Moss appealed to the Court of Appeals, asserting that his procedural due process 
rights had been violated, that the Board had made incorrect evidentiary rulings, and that 
the  Board’s  decision  was  “arbitrary  and/or  was unsupported  by  substantial  and  material 
evidence.”  Moss  v.  Shelby  Cnty.  Civ.  Serv.  Merit  Bd.,  No.  W2017-01813-COA-R3-CV, 
2018 WL 4913829, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 10, 2018), rev’d, 597 S.W.3d 823 (Tenn. 
2020).  The  Court  of  Appeals  reversed  the  Board’s  decision on  due  process  grounds, 
concluding that the Loudermill notice was inadequate. Id. at *3–5. Pretermitting the other 
issues, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the trial court with instructions to 
order the Board to reinstate Mr. Moss to his position with the Fire Department with benefits 
and back pay. Id. at *5.

We  granted  the  Board’s  petition for  review and  held  that  Mr.  Moss  received 
adequate notice of the factual allegations against him and had an opportunity to prepare for 
his hearing before the Board. Moss, 597 S.W.3d at 832–33. We reversed and remanded the 
case to the Court of Appeals to consider the remaining issues. Id. at 834.

On remand, the Court of Appeals concluded that there had been no violation of Mr. 
Moss’s procedural  due  process  rights  during  the  Board  hearing and  that  the  Board’s 
decision was supported by substantial and material evidence. Moss, 2021 WL 4786370, at 
*8–12,  *18–19.  However,  the  Court  of  Appeals  found  the  Board’s  decision  to  exclude 
evidence of past discipline during Chief Benson’s cross-examination to be arbitrary and 
unreasonable because  this  evidence  was  not  “clearly  irrelevant”  when  counsel’s  stated 
purpose was impeaching the testimony of Chief Benson about his uniform application of 
his termination policy. Id. at *17. The case was remanded to the Board for consideration 
of Mr. Moss’s disparate discipline evidence with respect to the one specific employee Chief 
Benson was asked about, as well as other past disciplinary instances Mr. Moss intended to 
introduce. Id.

We granted the Board’s application for permission to appeal to consider the only 
remaining  issue:  Whether  a  civil  service  merit  board  acts  arbitrarily  or  capriciously  by 
declining  to  consider  evidence  of  more  lenient  discipline  previously  imposed  on other 
employees.

When  reviewing  the  decision  of  a  civil  service  merit  board  “affect[ing]  the 
employment status of a county or city civil service employee,” courts apply the standard 
of review outlined in the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (“UAPA”). Tenn. Code 

II.

Ann. § 27-9-114(b)(1) (2000 &  Supp. 2013);  Davis v. Shelby Cnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 278 
S.W.3d 256, 263–64 (Tenn. 2009). Unlike the “broad standard of review used in other civil 
appeals,”  the  UAPA  provides  a  more  narrowly  circumscribed  standard.  Tenn. Dep’t  of 
Corr. v. Pressley, 528 S.W.3d 506, 512 (Tenn. 2017) (citing Davis, 278 S.W.3d at 263–
64). Under that standard of review:

The  court  may  affirm  the  decision  of  the  agency  or  remand  the  case  for 
further  proceedings.  The  court  may  reverse  or  modify  the  decision  if  the 
rights  of  the  petitioner  have  been  prejudiced  because  the  administrative 
findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:

(1)

(2)

In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;

In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;

(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;

Arbitrary  or  capricious  or  characterized  by  abuse  of  discretion  or 

(4)
clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or

(5)(A) Unsupported by evidence that is both substantial and material in the 
light of the entire record.

In determining the substantiality of evidence, the court shall take into
(B)
account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight, but the court 
shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the 
evidence on questions of fact.

Mr. Moss asserts that the Board’s decision to uphold his termination was arbitrary

employees. See id. § -322(h)(4).

than a preponderance of the evidence and more than a ‘scintilla or glimmer’ of evidence.” 
StarLink Logistics, 494 S.W.3d at 669 (citation omitted) (quoting Wayne Cnty., 756 S.W.2d 
at 280). “A decision with evidentiary support can be arbitrary or capricious if it amounts 
to a clear error in judgment,” id. at 669 (citing City of Memphis v. Civ. Serv. Comm’n of 
Memphis, 216 S.W.3d 311, 316 (Tenn. 2007)), and “is not based on any course of reasoning

But as this Court noted in StarLink Logistics:

If there is room for two opinions, a decision is not arbitrary or capricious if 
it  is  made  honestly  and  upon  due  consideration,  even  though  [a  reviewing 
court]  think[s]  a  different  conclusion  might  have  been  reached.  The 
“arbitrary or capricious” standard is a limited scope of review, and a court 
will not overturn a decision of an agency acting within its area of expertise 
and  within  the  exercise  of  its  judgment  solely  because  the  court  disagrees 
with an agency’s ultimate conclusion.

Civil  service  employees  may  be  subject  to  dismissal  “[f]or  unsatisfactory 
performance of duties or other just cause.”5 § 22, 1971 Tenn. Priv. Acts at 504–05; Davis, 
278 S.W.3d at 265 n.19. In the context of civil service employee terminations, civil service 
merit  boards  seek  to  determine  whether  those  terminations  are  supported  by  evidence 
establishing  “just  cause.”  §  23,  1971  Tenn.  Priv.  Acts at  505–06 (“The  board  shall  . . . 
commence a hearing thereon, and shall thereupon fully hear and determine the matter and 
shall  either  affirm,  modify  or  revoke  such  order  of  discipline.”);  cf.  Lamarr  v.  City  of 
Memphis, No. W2002-02087-COA-R3-CV, 2004 WL 370298, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 
27,  2004)  (Kirby,  J.,  concurring)  (“LaMarr’s  defense  regarding  the  new  zero  tolerance 
policy appears to be that no one had told him that [the policy] would really be enforced. 
This is smokescreen. The real issue is whether there was sufficient evidence to support the 
Commission’s conclusion that LaMarr violated [the policy] . . . .”).

We accord significant deference to a merit board’s just cause determination. Thus,
as a reviewing court, we “will not overturn a decision of an agency acting within its area 
of expertise and within the exercise of its judgment solely because the court disagrees with 
an agency’s ultimate conclusion.” StarLink Logistics, 494 S.W.3d at 670 (citing Bowers, 
13 P.3d at 1083).

The operative question is whether the Board’s decision to disallow questions about 
more lenient discipline imposed on other Fire Department employees was a “clear error in 
judgment”  that  rendered  the  decision  arbitrary  or  capricious.  See  id. at  669–70.  Our 
analysis begins with the issue the Board had to decide—whether there was evidence of Mr. 
Moss’s unsatisfactory  performance  of duties  or  other  just  cause  for  termination. To 
determine  whether  the  Board  acted  arbitrarily  or  capriciously  by  excluding  Mr.  Moss’s 
proposed questioning, we must examine the relevance of that questioning to the Board’s 
                                           

5 The Court of Appeals has previously addressed what exactly qualifies as “just cause”:

The  term  “cause”  implies  good  cause  which  must  be  substantial;  but,  any  reasonable, 
sufficient cause may be ground for dismissal, and the power to discharge is not limited to 
specific  grounds.  The  term  “cause”  is  construed  to  mean  some  substantial  shortcoming 
which  renders  continuance  in  office  or  employment  in  some  way  detrimental  to  the 
discipline  and  efficiency  of  the  service  and  something  which  the  law  and  sound  public 
opinion recognize as good cause for removal.

is not relevant is inadmissible. Tenn. R. Evid. 402; see Hayes v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville 
&  Davidson  Cnty.,  No.  01-A-019108CH00291,  1992  WL  40194,  at  *5  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
Mar.  4,  1992)  (“While  the  rules  of  evidence  are  relaxed  in  administrative  hearings  in 
comparison to judicial proceedings, even in administrative hearings, there must be some 
relevancy  to the issue before the administrative body.”).6 To be relevant, evidence  must 
tend “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the 
action  more  probable  or  less  probable  than  it would  be  without  the  evidence.”  Tenn.  R.
Evid. 401.  The  essential  facts  “of  consequence”  to  the  Board’s  decision  involved Mr. 
Moss’s conduct. Evidence about discipline that may have been imposed on employees in 
other  situations  did  not  tend  to  make  the  facts  about  Mr.  Moss’s  conduct  more  or  less 
probable. 

Relevancy of discipline imposed on other employees in a termination proceeding 
was considered in Knoxville Utilities Board v. Knoxville Civil Service Merit Board, No. 
03A01-9301-CH-00008, 1993 WL 229505 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 1993). In this case, a 
utilities services employee was terminated after testing positive for  marijuana. Id. at *1.
The merit board overturned the termination, concluding that evidence of discipline in other 
cases should be considered in the just cause analysis. Id. at *6. The chancery court reversed, 
finding that employee was fired for just cause. Id. at *9. The Court of Appeals framed the 
merit board’s task as deciding “whether there was just cause to terminate [the employee], 
not whether [the utility board] could have terminated others and chose not to. . . . [T]he 
relevant inquiry is whether the actions of the employee before the administrative tribunal 
constituted just cause for discharge.” Id. at *13 (citing Fairweather v. Long, 10 TAM 11-3

6 While  Board  hearings  are  not  subject  to  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Evidence,  the  Rules  provide 
helpful guidance in determining whether the Board’s decision to exclude Mr. Moss’s evidence comports 
with  “a  sense  of  fair  play  and  the  avoidance  of  undue  prejudice.”  Davis,  278  S.W.3d  at  266  (quoting

Mr.  Moss  argues  that  Tennessee  courts  have  consistently  allowed  civil  service 
employees  to  introduce  disparate  discipline  evidence8 during  merit  board  hearings. We 
disagree. Mr. Moss does not claim an equal protection violation based on membership in a 
protected class; his only claim is that other, similarly situated individuals before him have 
received more lenient discipline. Tennessee courts have rejected this “class-of-one” equal 
protection  argument in  the  public  employment  context by  noting  that  the  relevance  of 
disparate  discipline evidence  is  especially  limited  in  cases  like  this,  where  a  terminated 
employee is not claiming a constitutional equal protection violation. In Echols v. City of 
Memphis, a police officer was terminated after he lied about violating department policy 
by  working  a  second  job.  No.  W2013-00410-COA-R3-CV,  2013  WL 5230251,  at  *1 
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Sept.  16,  2013).  The  employee argued  that  his  termination  should  be 
reversed because others violating the same policy only received verbal reprimands, and he 
unsuccessfully attempted to introduce evidence of this before the City of Memphis Civil 
Service Commission. Id. The Court of Appeals held that the so-called “class-of-one” equal 
protection claim was not cognizable in the context of public employment and that evidence 
of disparate discipline was not material. Id. at *3–4. The Echols court relied on the United 
States Supreme Court’s decision in Engquist v. Oregon Department of Agriculture, which 
rejected a similar claim by noting that “[t]o treat employees differently is not to classify 
them in a way that raises equal protection concerns.” Id. at *3 (quoting 553 U.S. 591, 605 
(2008));  see  also  Robert  C.  Farrell,  The  Equal  Protection  Class  of  One  Claim:  Olech, 
Engquist, and the Supreme Court’s Misadventure, 61 S.C. L. Rev. 107, 127 (2009) (“The 
[Engquist] Court noted that while ‘government employees do not lose their constitutional 
rights when they accept their positions,’ the government maintains ‘significantly  greater 
leeway  in  its  dealings  with  citizen  employees  than it  does  when  it  brings  its  sovereign 
power  to  bear  on  citizens  at  large.’ Because  government  employees  interact  with  the 
government  in  this  proprietary  context,  their  class  of  one  equal  protection  claims  are 
correspondingly limited.” (footnotes omitted) (quoting Engquist, 553 U.S. at 599–600)).
Thus,  Echols  held  that  the  Commission  did  not  err  by  refusing  to  allow the  disparate 
discipline evidence. Echols, 2013 WL 5230251, at *4; see also Holmes v. City of Memphis 
Civ. Serv. Comm’n, No. W2016-00590-COA-R3-CV, 2017 WL 129113, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. 
App.  Jan.  13,  2017)  (“[I]t  makes  sense  to  consider  evidence  intended  to  show  disparate 

                                           

8 Both parties use the term “disparate treatment evidence” to describe the questioning Mr. Moss 
offered  before  the  Board.  In  the  context  of  this  case,  however,  “disparate  treatment”  is  a  misnomer. 
“Disparate treatment” is a term of art signifying a theory of discrimination “where an employer has treated 
a particular person less favorably than others because of a protected trait.” Goree v. United Parcel Serv., 
Inc.,  490 S.W.3d  413,  426  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2015)  (emphasis  added)  (quoting  Maddox  v.  Tenn.  Student 
Assistance  Corp.,  No.  M2009-02171-COA-R3-CV,  2010  WL  2943279,  at  *6  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  July  27, 
2010)). Therefore, for clarity, we refer to Mr. Moss’s proposed questions as “disparate discipline evidence.”

treatment violating equal protection only insofar as it is based on discrimination against a 
suspect class.”).9

In  contending  he  should  have  been  able  to  introduce  his  disparate  discipline 
evidence,  Mr.  Moss  relies  on  several  Court  of  Appeals  cases.  None  are  persuasive. For 
instance, in Mack v. Civil Service Commission of City of Memphis, a public employee was 
terminated  for  failing  to  follow  orders,  and  termination  was  affirmed  by  both  the 
administrative agency and the trial court. No. 02A01-9807-CH-00215, 1999 WL 250180, 
at *1–2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 28, 1999). The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the 
trial court to consider the plaintiff’s disparate treatment evidence. Id. at *6. But the plaintiff 
in Mack, unlike Mr. Moss, was seeking to prove discrimination based on protected class 
status. Id.  at  *5–6;  see  Engquist,  553  U.S.  at  605  (“[T]he  Equal  Protection  Clause  is 
implicated when the government makes class-based decisions in the employment context, 
treating  distinct  groups  of  individuals  categorically  differently.  .  .  .  But  we  have  never 
found the Equal Protection Clause implicated . . . where, as here, government employers 
are alleged to have made an individualized, subjective personnel decision in a seemingly 
arbitrary or irrational manner.”). Because the UAPA provides grounds for reversal where 
an agency decision is “[i]n  violation of constitutional or statutory provisions,” the Mack 
court  properly  remanded  the  case  to  the  trial  court  for  consideration  of  the  employee’s 
evidence. Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-5-322(h)(1).

Barrom v. City of Memphis Civil Service Commission is distinguishable for similar 
reasons.  No.  W2011-01248-COA-R3-CV,  2011  WL 5420365  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Nov.  9, 
2011).10 In that case, a Memphis police officer was terminated after a physical altercation 
with  a  parking  lot  attendant.  Id.  at  *1.  The  City  of  Memphis  Civil  Service  Commission 
                                           

9 Mr. Moss attempts to distinguish Holmes by pointing out that the Court of Appeals came to its 
conclusion  after  considering  the  plaintiff’s  petition  for  judicial  review  made  no  reference  to  any  policy 
requiring equal treatment. 2017 WL 129113, at *8. He argues that Holmes differs from this case because 
Chief Benson asserted in his testimony before the Board that he uniformly applied his disciplinary policy. 
But  Holmes  stands  for  the  proposition  that  disparate  discipline  evidence  is  only  pertinent  to  the  extent 
discrimination is claimed based on protected class status. Despite Chief Benson’s claims of a uniformly 
applied disciplinary policy, Mr. Moss did not claim he was treated differently under that policy based on 
his status in a protected class.

10 Notably, Barrom was designated as a “memorandum opinion” pursuant to Rule 10 of the Rules 
of the Court of Appeals of Tennessee. Tenn. Ct. App. R. 10 (allowing for the issuance of a memorandum 
opinion “when a formal opinion would have no precedential value” and providing that such opinions “shall 
not be published[] and shall not be cited or relied on for any reason in any unrelated case”). While we are 
not bound by the rules of the intermediate appellate court, we have previously declined to cite or rely upon 
cases designated as “memorandum opinions” under Rule 10. See Glassman, Edwards, Wyatt, Tuttle & Cox, 
P.C. v. Wade, 404 S.W.3d 464, 467 n.5 (Tenn. 2013).

refused to consider the officer’s equal protection claim and affirmed his termination. Id. at 
*1, *3–4. On appeal, the chancery court affirmed the termination, declining to consider the 
officer’s  contention  that  his  equal  protection  rights  had  been  violated  by  disparate 
application of disciplinary rules. Id. at *1–2. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded 
for consideration of the disparate treatment evidence. Id. at *5. The Barrom court’s reversal 
was predicated on the fact that the officer “sufficiently asserted an equal protection claim 
when  he  asserted  disparate  application  of  the  disciplinary  rules.”  Id.  (emphasis  added). 
Thus,  unlike  Mr.  Moss,  the  officer  advanced  a  constitutional  equal  protection  argument 
which was not considered, and the chancery court erred by failing to consider it. See id. 
Barrom  should  not  be  read  to  support  requiring  merit  boards  to  consider  evidence  of 
disparate  discipline  when  the  terminated  employee  does  not  sufficiently  assert  a 
constitutional equal protection violation based on protected class status.11

In requiring the Board to hear Mr. Moss’s evidence regarding disparate discipline 
of other employees, the Court of Appeals failed to adhere to the narrow standard of review 
required  by  the  UAPA  and  primarily  relied  on  City  of  Memphis  v.  Cattron,  No. 
W2010-01659-COA-R3-CV, 2011 WL 1902167 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 13, 2011). There, a 
911 dispatcher was terminated after he improperly cancelled an emergency call from a man 
without  sending  police,  resulting  in  the  man’s  death.  Id.  at  *1.  The  merit  board  heard 
evidence  regarding  two  other  dispatchers  who  had  similarly  cancelled  calls  and  only 
received  suspensions.  Id.  at  *2.  The  merit  board  reversed  the  termination based  on  the 
lesser  discipline  imposed  on  other  dispatchers  for  similar  violations.  Id.  at  *3.  Both  the 
chancery court and the intermediate appellate court affirmed. Id. at *3, *7. The Court of 
Appeals’ reliance on Cattron is misplaced. The Cattron court explicitly noted that the City 
had  not  raised  the  issue  of  whether  past  discipline  should  have  been  considered  at  all; 
rather, the City sought review on whether the merit board improperly accorded significant 
                                           

11 Mr. Moss also cites to Stroud v. Shelby County Civil Service Commission, No. W2005-01909-
COA-R3-CV, 2006 WL 305796 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 2006). In Stroud, the merit board initially refused 
to  consider  evidence  that  the  terminated  employees  “had  been  treated  unfairly  or  disparately  when 
compared to another allegedly similarly situated employee who had received less drastic punishment for 
allegedly similar conduct.” Id. at *1. Despite claiming “that the policies ordinances [sic] of Shelby County, 
while constitutional on their face, were applied in a disparate fashion in violation of their equal protection 
rights  under  both  the  United  States  Constitutional  [sic]  and  Tennessee  Constitution,”  the  terminated 
employees did not claim  equal protection violations based  on protected class status. Brief for Appellees 
Thomas  &  Stroud at  20,  Stroud  v.  Shelby  Cnty.  Civ.  Serv.  Comm’n,  No.  W2005-01909-COA-R3-CV 
(Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 3, 2005), 2005 WL 6521522. The chancery court remanded the case back to the merit 
board for consideration of that argument. Stroud, 2006 WL 305796, at *1. Thus, the Court of Appeals was 
bound to address the evidence introduced in the proceedings below. Id. at *3. But the merit board in Stroud 
acted within its discretion in refusing to entertain such a “class-of-one” equal protection argument, and the 
chancery court erred by requiring the merit board to consider that argument on remand. See Holmes, 2017 
WL 129113, at *8; Echols, 2013 WL 5230251, at *3–4.

weight  to  the  other  cases.  Id.  at  *6  (“While  the  City  raised  evidentiary  issues  related  to 
these  other  cases  at  the  Commission  hearing,  it  has  not  raised  these  issues  on  appeal. 
Rather,  the  City’s  argument  goes  to  the  weight
that  should  be  placed  on  such 
incidents. . . .”). While Cattron might tacitly approve of one merit board’s consideration of 
disparate discipline evidence, nothing in the decision requires merit boards to hear such 
evidence.12

Thus, in requiring the Board to consider disparate discipline evidence on remand, 
the  Court  of  Appeals  elides  the  actual  holdings  of  the  cases  cited.  None  of  those  cases 
required  the  merit  board  on  remand  to  consider  such  evidence. The cases either  do  not 
directly  require  the  merit  board  to  hear  the  evidence  or  otherwise  fail  to  address  the 
question  of  whether  the  merit  board  must  hear  the  evidence.  As  such,  the  intermediate 
appellate court’s opinion in this case is unique in its outright instruction for the Board to 
consider disparate discipline evidence.

If  allowed  to  stand,  the  Court  of  Appeals  decision  would  confine  civil  service
agencies to a level of imposed discipline in line with previous instances. For example, if a 
civil service agency wants to “crack down” on particularly troubling behavior within the 
agency, it would be limited to whatever discipline was previously meted out in the past, 
essentially  nullifying  any  deterrent  effect. There  is  also  the  issue  of  pragmatism.  If  Mr. 
Moss’s argument carries the day, merit boards (and the courts to which their decisions are 
appealed)  will  sift  through  instances  of  past  discipline  to determine  whether  the  prior 
instances  are  analogous  to  the  cases  before  them.  And,  at  the  very  least,  Mr.  Moss’s 
position does not fit within the “limited scope of review” utilized by this Court in reviewing
administrative agency decisions and would undermine the deference we have traditionally 
given to agencies with regard to personnel matters. StarLink Logistics, 494 S.W.3d at 670.

In sum, the Board’s decision to exclude Mr. Moss’s disparate discipline evidence
was not a clear error in judgment. See id. at 669. The Board did not abuse its discretion in 
determining that the evidence was irrelevant to the issue of whether there was just cause to 
terminate Mr. Moss’s employment.

                                           

12 The Court of Appeals cited several other cases supporting its decision to require the Board to 
hear Mr. Moss’s evidence on remand. Moss, 2021 WL 4786370, at *16 (citing Cooper v. City of Memphis 
Civ. Serv. Comm’n, No. W2018-01112-COA-R3-CV, 2019 WL 3774086, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 12, 
2019); City  of  Memphis  v. Civ.  Serv.  Comm’n  of  Memphis,  No.  W2006-01258-COA-R3-CV,  2007  WL 
1227465, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 25, 2007); Lamarr, 2004 WL 370298, at *1–3). But, like Cattron, 
these cases implicitly approve of the introduction of disparate discipline evidence but do not require merit 
boards to consider such evidence.

CONCLUSION

We hold that a civil service merit board does not act arbitrarily or capriciously by 
declining to allow an employee challenging his termination for just cause to inquire about 
more lenient discipline imposed on other employees. Thus, the Court of Appeals erred by 
finding the Board’s decision arbitrary and unreasonable and remanding to the Board to hear 
evidence of discipline imposed on other employees. We reverse the judgment of the Court 
of Appeals and affirm the judgment of the trial court. The costs of this appeal are taxed to

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
