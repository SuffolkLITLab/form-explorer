Assigned on Briefs March 7, 2023

STATE OF TENNESSEE v. MARLON JACKSON

Appeal from the Criminal Court for Shelby County
No. 20-00393   James M. Lammey, Jr., Judge
___________________________________

No. W2022-01288-CCA-R3-CD
___________________________________

The  Defendant,  Marlon  Jackson,  appeals  the  trial  court’s  revocation  of  his  three-year 
probationary sentence for attempted possession of methamphetamine with the intent to sell 
or  deliver.    The  trial  court  revoked  the  Defendant’s  probation  after  determining  that  he 
materially  violated  his  probation  sentence  for  engaging  in  criminal  activity  and  being 
charged with new offenses.  On appeal, the Defendant asserts that the trial court abused its 
discretion when it revoked his probation because the evidence to support the violation was 
“inconclusive,  contradictory,  and  based  upon  unreliable  hearsay.”    After  review,  we 
conclude that the record supports the trial court’s finding that the Defendant violated the 
terms of his probation sentence.

OPINION
I. Facts

03/23/2023On  December  10,  2021,  the  Defendant  pleaded  guilty  to  an  amended  charge  of 
criminal  attempt  to  possess  heroin  with  the  intent  to  sell  or  deliver1 for  an  agreed-upon 
sentence of three years, to be served on probation.  In relevant part, the conditions of the 
Defendant’s probation sentence required that he: (1) not violate any laws; (2) not possess 
any firearms, ammunition or illegal weapon; and (3) pay all required court fees.   

On  May  24,  2022,  a  State  probation  officer,  Melissa  Stevens,  filed  an  affidavit 
alleging that the Defendant: (1) was arrested on May 8, 2022, for attempted second degree 
murder, employing a firearm with the intent to commit a felony, reckless endangerment,
unlawful possession of a weapon, and false offense report; (2) possessed a black handgun; 
and (3) failed to pay supervision fees and court costs.  Based upon these allegations, the 
trial court issued a warrant on the same day for the Defendant’s arrest.  

The  trial  court  held  hearings  on  the  probation  violation  on  July  26,  July  27,  and 
August 17, 2022.  At the initial hearing, the State announced that the basis of the violation 
was the Defendant’s new arrest involving possession of a weapon.  According to the State, 
the Defendant exchanged gunfire with another individual at Nana’s Market that resulted in 
gunfire injuries.  A female sitting nearby the exchange, the other shooter, and the Defendant 
all suffered gunshot injuries.

Memphis Police Department (“MPD”) Officer Markieta Richardson reported to the 
scene and observed the Defendant, who wore jeans and a white shirt, seated in a silver car.  
Officer Richardson recalled that the Defendant said that he had been shot.  

The  State  played  surveillance  video  footage  of  the  shooting  that  showed  a  man 
wearing a “reddish or orange outfit” firing a gun and another man, wearing a white shirt 
and jeans, returning gunfire then  “ducking and running.”  Officer Richardson confirmed 
that the Defendant was the man in the video wearing the white shirt and jeans and was the 
same man seated in the silver car when she arrived.  Officer Richardson had viewed the 
recording shown at the hearing, but also had viewed another video recording that provided 
“more of a full-on view of the actual shooting.”  The surveillance video recording showed 
the Defendant get into the silver car Officer Richardson found him in when she arrived at 
the crime scene.  

Officer  Richardson  agreed  that  the  surveillance  video  showed  that  the  Defendant
left  the  crime  scene  after  he  was  shot  and  then  later  returned.   The  surveillance  footage 
showed the silver car returning and parking in the location where Officer Richardson found 
it upon her arrival.

                                           

1 Both parties refer to the conviction as attempted possession of methamphetamine; however, the 

judgment indicates the Defendant was convicted of attempted possession of heroin.   

2

On  cross-examination,  Officer  Richardson  testified  that  she  spoke  with  the 
Defendant very briefly because medical personnel were attending to his injuries.  She could 
not  recall  whether  the  Defendant  admitted  involvement  in  a  “shootout.”    On  redirect 
examination, Officer Richardson clarified that she had learned from another officer at the 
scene that the Defendant had been “involved in a shooting.”  In contradiction of her prior 
testimony, Officer Richardson testified that she did not recall if the clothing worn by the 
man  in  the  surveillance  video  was  the  same  clothing  worn  by  the  Defendant  when  she 
arrived at the scene.

Defense Counsel objected to Officer Richardson’s testimony about the Defendant’s 
statement to another officer as hearsay.  The trial court inquired about testimony from the 
other  officer and  the  State  responded  that  a  subpoena  had  been  issued  but  there  was  no 
return on the subpoena.  The trial court continued the hearing to the following day to allow 
the State time to locate the officer.  

On July 27, 2022, the State announced that the subpoenaed officer had been sick for 
two weeks and would not return for several more days.  The trial court reset the hearing.  

On  August  17,  2022,  the  hearing  resumed  and  MPD  Sergeant  Tuboris  Martin 
testified that he investigated the shooting that occurred at Nana’s Market.  He reviewed 
surveillance video recovered from the scene.  He explained that two individuals engaged 
in  a  disagreement  resulting  in  the  exchange  of  gunfire  in  the  parking  lot  with  multiple 
bystanders.  The video showed one man, later identified as the Defendant,  run around the 
parking lot to the rear of the store while firing his gun.  He then entered a silver car and 
drove away before later returning.   Sergeant Martin identified the individuals who were 
involved through verification of officers on the scene, witnesses, vehicle registration, and 
“multiple databases.”  

The State played the surveillance video footage, and Sergeant Martin identified the 
two vehicles involved with the shooting: a black SUV and a silver sedan.  As part of his 
investigation, he determined that the Defendant was in the silver sedan.  Sergeant Martin 
narrated as the video played.  He noted the man exiting the silver sedan wore a white shirt, 
tan  pants,  and  white  tennis  shoes.    He  stated  that  this  man  was  the  Defendant.    The 
Defendant  and  another  individual  entered  the  store  and  went  to  the  ATM  machine.    In 
another portion of the video, Sergeant Martin noted that it appeared that the Defendant had 
a  pistol  in  his  hand.    The  State  replayed  that  portion,  and  the  trial  court  stated,  “That’s 
definitely a pistol.”  Sergeant Martin identified a portion of the video where the Defendant 
and the other individual were exchanging gunfire.  As the Defendant ran around toward the 
back of the building, he placed the gun in his waistband and got into his vehicle and drove 
away.    About  four  minutes  later,  the  silver  sedan  returned  to  the  scene  where  medical 

3

personnel  soon  began  treating  his  gunshot  wound.    Sergeant  Martin  confirmed  that  the 
Defendant  did  not  have  a  gun  in  his  possession  when  he  returned  to  Nana’s  Market.  
Sergeant Martin stated that the Defendant made no statements about his involvement at the 
crime scene.     
   
On cross-examination, Sergeant Martin agreed that he did not witness the event but 
based  his  knowledge  about  the  crime  on  the  surveillance  footage.    Sergeant  Martin 
identified the Defendant as the person in the footage based upon: several Crime Stopper 
tips  identifying  the  Defendant; officers  at  the  scene  who  verified  the  Defendant’s 
identification; the  vehicle  the  Defendant  drove; the  clothing  worn at  the  time  of  the 
shooting; and medical records admitting the Defendant to the hospital for gunshot wounds.  
Sergeant Martin viewed additional surveillance footage taken inside the store, and the man 
inside  the  store  at  the  ATM  wore  the  same  clothes  as  the  shooter  seen  in  the  outside 
surveillance video, and the same clothes worn by the Defendant at the time he was being 
treated for the gunshot wound.

The Defendant objected to Sergeant Martin’s testimony as hearsay.  The trial court 
then  asked  specific  questions about  Sergeant  Martin’s  investigation  and  the  information 
obtained  during  the  course  of  the  investigation.    Sergeant  Martin  reiterated  that  he 
identified the man at the scene in the silver car through multiple sources, including medical 
records for treatment of his gunshot wound, even though he personally was not at the scene.  
The trial court overruled the Defendant’s hearsay objection, noting that reliable hearsay is 
admissible in probation revocation hearings.  

After hearing the evidence, the trial court found by a preponderance of the evidence 
that the Defendant, who was treated at the scene, was the same person who was firing the 
gun in the surveillance video and, therefore, the Defendant had violated his probation by 
possessing a handgun.  After the trial court ruled, the Defendant was sworn in and testified 
that he “was the victim” and that he never violated his probation sentence.     

II. Analysis

The Defendant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it revoked his 
probation sentence.  The State responds that the trial court properly exercised its discretion 
in revoking probation.  We agree with the State.

A trial court’s authority to revoke a suspended sentence is derived from Tennessee 
Code  Annotated  section  40-35-310  (2019),  which  provides  that  the  trial  court  possesses 
the power “at any time within the maximum time which was directed and ordered by the 
court  for  such  suspension,  .  .  .  to  revoke  .  .  .  such  suspension”  and  cause  the  original 
judgment to be put into effect.  A trial court may revoke probation upon its finding by a 

4

preponderance of the evidence that a violation of the conditions of probation has occurred.  
T.C.A.  §  40-35-311(e)  (2019).    “In  probation  revocation  hearings,  the  credibility  of 
witnesses is to be determined by the trial judge.”  State v. Mitchell, 810 S.W.2d 733, 735 
(Tenn. Crim. App. 1991).  If a trial court revokes a defendant’s probation, options include 
ordering confinement, ordering the sentence into execution as originally entered, returning 
the  defendant  to  probation  on  modified  conditions  as  appropriate,  or  extending  the 
defendant’s  period  of  probation  by  up  to  two  years.    T.C.A.  §§  40-35-308(a),  (c),  -310 
(2018); see State v. Hunter, 1 S.W.3d 643, 648 (Tenn. 1999).

The  judgment  of  the  trial  court  in  a  revocation  proceeding,  including  the 
consequences of the revocation, is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness unless there 
has been an abuse of discretion.  See State v. Dagnan, 641 S.W.3d 751, 759 (Tenn. 2022); 
see  also  State  v.  Shaffer,  45  S.W.3d  553,  554  (Tenn.  2001);  State  v.  Smith,  909  S.W.2d 
471, 473 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995).  The credibility of the witnesses is for the determination 
of the trial judge.  Bledsoe v. State, 387 S.W.2d 811, 814 (Tenn. 1965); State v. Delp, 614 
S.W.2d 395, 398 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1980).  On review, the findings of the trial judge have 
the  weight  of  a  jury  verdict.    Carver  v.  State,  570  S.W.2d  872,  875  (Tenn.  Crim.  App. 
1978).    For  this  Court  to  find  an  abuse  of  discretion  by  the  trial  court  in  a  probation 
revocation  case,  a  defendant  must  demonstrate  “that  the  record  contains  no  substantial 
evidence to support the conclusion of the trial judge that a violation of the conditions of 
probation has occurred.”  Delp, 614 S.W.2d at 398.

The Defendant’s arguments on appeal largely center around the credibility of the 
State’s two witnesses.  As earlier stated, credibility of witnesses is within the trial court’s 
determination.  Bledsoe, 387 S.W. 2d at 814.  As such, we do not assess the credibility of 
the witnesses, rather we review the evidence presented at the hearing.  The record in this 
case  supports  the  trial  court’s  finding,  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  that  the 
Defendant violated his probation.  First, the Defendant does not contest his presence at the 
shooting scene.  He acknowledged that he was a victim of the shooting.  The trial court 
viewed  surveillance  footage  that  showed the  Defendant arriving  in  a  silver  sedan  and 
wearing  a  white  shirt  and  tan  jeans.    A  man  wearing  the  same  clothing  began  firing  at 
another man whom the Defendant had earlier spoken with and gone with to the ATM inside 
the store.   After the shooting, the man wearing the white shirt and tan jeans got back in the 
silver sedan and left for approximately four minutes before returning to the scene where 
medical  personnel  treated  the  Defendant  for  gunshot  injuries  and  transported him to  the 
hospital.

The  Defendant  makes  a  cursory  mention  of  “unreliable  hearsay”  with  no  further 
argument or authority in support of this contention.  “Strict rules of evidence do not apply 
at revocation hearings.”  State v. Lewis, 917 S.W.2d 251, 257 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995) at 
257 (citing Practy v. State, 525 S.W.2d 677, 680 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1974); Barker v. State, 

5

483 S.W.2d 586 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1972)).  “Reliable hearsay has been held admissible in 
a probation revocation hearing so long as the defendant had a fair opportunity to rebut the 
evidence.”  Id. (citing State v. Carney, 752 S.W.2d 513 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1988)).  In order 
for hearsay evidence to be deemed admissible, a trial court must find that “good cause” 
exists to justify the denial of the right to confront witnesses and that the hearsay evidence 
is  reliable.    State  v.  Wade,  863  S.W.2d  406,  409  (Tenn. 1993).    The  trial  court  made  a 
specific  finding  that  the  hearsay  was  reliable.    Although  the  trial  court  did  not  make  a 
specific finding of “good cause” for the admission of the officer’s hearsay testimony, such 
a finding was implicit in the trial court’s words and findings.  See State v. Roy Cherry, No. 
W2015-01084-CCA-R3-CD, 2016 WL 520304 at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Jackson, Nov. 
3,  2015),  perm.  app.  denied (Tenn.  Feb.  8,  2016).    Further,  the  Defendant  had  the 
opportunity  to  rebut  the  officer’s  testimony;  however,  he  confirmed  his  presence  at  the 
shooting as a “victim.”  

The  record  reflects  that  the  Defendant  violated  the  terms  of  his  probation  by 
possessing a weapon and committing a new offense while on probation.  Accordingly, the 
trial court was justified in revoking the Defendant’s probation, and it was within the trial 
court’s authority to order the Defendant to serve his original sentence upon revoking the 
Defendant’s probation sentence.  The Defendant is not entitled to relief.

II. Conclusion

Based  on  the  foregoing  reasoning  and  authorities,  we  affirm  the  trial  court’s 

judgment.
