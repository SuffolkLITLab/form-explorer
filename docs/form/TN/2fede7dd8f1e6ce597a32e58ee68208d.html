Applicants and those supporting the applicants may contact the Governor’s Council 
for Judicial Appointments members personally.  The contact information  for the 
members of the Governor’s Council for Judicial Appointments may be found here.  

Applicants are notified of the date, time, location, and format of the interview by 
the Administrative Office of the Courts.  

Applicants  are  evaluated  in  order  to  fulfill  the  purposes  set  forth  in  the  State  of 
Tennessee  Executive  Order  No.  87  (September  17,  2021).  The  Council  has 
determined that an integral part of fulfilling its duties includes consideration of at 
least the following criteria:  integrity, impartiality, industry, legal knowledge and 
ability,  legal  experience,  temperament,  and  public  service.    This  list  is  not 
exhaustive.  Each applicant should take care to inform the Council of the individual 
items  that  applicant  feels  best  demonstrate  the  applicant’s  qualification  for  the 
judicial position sought.   

Applicants  eliminated from  consideration for nomination are notified  as  soon as 
possible after that decision is made.  

Typically, the names of three (3) nominees are submitted to the Governor for each 
vacancy.  The nominees are listed in alphabetical order without any indication of 
preference by the Council.  

The  names  of  nominees  forwarded  to  the  Governor  are  made  public  by  the 
Governor’s Council for Judicial Appointments.  The application packages of those 
nominees are also forwarded to the Governor for review by the Governor and the 
Governor’s staff.  

All appointments made pursuant to Executive Order No. 87 (September 17, 2021) 
shall be effective on the date the vacancy occurs or on the date of appointment if 
the  vacancy  has  already  occurred.    All  appellate  court  appointments  shall  be 
effective  upon  confirmation  in  accordance  with  Article  VI,  Section  3  of  the 
Tennessee Constitution.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
