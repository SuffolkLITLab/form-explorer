The 2014 Tennessee Pro Bono Report 

Introduction 

he  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  declared  access  to  justice  its  number  one  strategic 
priority in 2008, thereby launching its Access to Justice Initiative.  The Court appointed 
an  Access  to  Justice  Commission  and  made  the  Commission  responsible  for 
developing  a  strategic  plan  for  educating  the  public  about  the  legal  needs  crisis, 
identifying  priorities  for  improving  access  to  justice,  and  recommending  projects  and 
programs  to  enhance  access  to  justice.    The  Access  to  Justice  Coordinator  at  the 
Tennessee  Supreme  Court  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts  staffs  the  Commission 
and the Court’s Initiative and provides supervision to the Pro Bono Coordinator.   

n  2011,  the  Chair  of  the  Commission  tasked  the  Access  to  Justice  Coordinator  with 
developing a snap shot of all of the pro bono work being done across the state.  To the 
Commission’s knowledge, the 2011 Pro Bono Report was the first endeavor to catalog 
pro bono work in Tennessee.  The Commission decided to compile pro bono data on an 
annual basis.   

his 2014 Tennessee Pro Bono Report contains information about and statistics on the 
hours  devoted  to  pro  bono  activities  of  legal  aid  providers,  bar  associations,  law 
schools, mediation centers, and other organizations in 2014.  It contains information and 
statistics on pro bono work done by individual attorneys in 2013 and reported in 2014. 
Comparisons with previous years’ statistics have also been completed.

Attorney Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Statistics 

The  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  adopted  Supreme  Court  Rule  9,  Section  20.11  on 
November  2,  2009.  The  Rule  requests  that  every  attorney  who  is  required  to  file  an 
Annual  Registration  Statement  with  the  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility  (“BPR”) 
voluntarily file a statement reporting the attorney’s pro bono service and activity during 
the last calendar year. The Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form was first included in the 
2010 BPR Registration Statement and reported data for the 2009 calendar year. 

The Tennessee Supreme Court approved a change in BPR Registration procedures to 
require  renewals  on  the  first  day  of  each  attorney’s  birth  month.  Under  this  new 
procedure, pro bono reporting data for the previous calendar year is not available until 
all reporting for that year has been received. 

The Access to Justice Commission now has pro bono reporting data for pro bono work 
reported  in  five  calendar  years,  2010  to  2014.  The  Access  to  Justice  Commission  is 
pleased  to  provide  an  analysis  of  the  2014  data  and  a  comparison  to  that  of  the 
previous four years. 

he data is labeled to correspond with the year the pro bono work was reported, not the 
year  the  pro  bono  work  was  performed.    For  example,  the  pro  bono  work  reported  in 
2014 and completed in 2013 will be labeled as the 2014 Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting 
Statistics.

Pursuant  to  the  Access  to  Justice  Commission’s  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Access  to 
Justice  Commission  is  focused  on  pro  bono  work  that  aids  Tennesseans.  The  2014 
statistics reflect pro bono work performed in 2013 and reported during the 2014 annual 
registration period.  The 2014 reporting form asked for feedback from attorneys in four 
categories of pro bono service.

Additional Information, Data and Survey Highlights 

Bar Association Pro Bono 

Using  www.surveymonkey.com,  the  Access  to  Justice  Coordinator  surveyed  regional 
and local bar associations about the pro bono initiatives and efforts sponsored by each 
bar association. Bar association presidents were emailed a link to complete the survey. 
The  Pro  Bono  Coordinator  followed  up  with  phone  calls  and  emails  to  encourage 
additional responses. 

To  date,  12  responses  were  received  from  bar  associations.  Highlights  and  insights 
obtained  from  some  of  the  survey  responses  are  listed  below.    A  chart  detailing  pro 
bono opportunities and pro bono statistics for the bar associations is attached as Exhibit 
A.

Law School Pro Bono 

In  its  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Access  to  Justice  Commission  acknowledged  the 
importance of introducing pro bono services to future attorneys while they are still in law 
school. The Access to Justice Commission committed to convening meetings with law 
school deans, law school pro bono directors, and students at least annually to explore 
increasing the participation of law students in pro bono activities. The Commission also 
compiled  the  pro  bono  policies  of  Tennessee  law  schools  into  one  document,  a  Pro 
Bono Policy Compilation, as a resource for Tennessee law schools and for law schools 
nationwide. 

The  ATJ  Commission  partnered  with  the  Tennessee  Bar  Association’s  Access  to 
Justice  Committee  to  participate  in  a  statewide  conference  for  law  school  Deans, 
faculty, and students to discuss issues specific to pro bono work done by law students.  
The meeting was held at the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law 
in  September  2014.    Students  learned  how  they  can  do  pro  bono  work  through  the 
Tennessee  Alliance  for  the  Legal  Services  and  various  Alternative  Spring  Projects.  
Justice  Cornelia  Clark,  ATJ  Commissioners  Houston  Gordon  and  Ann  Pruitt,  and 
Jonathan  Steen,  the  President  of  the TBA, all  spoke  to  students  on  the  importance  of 
pro bono work.  The Pro Bono Coordinator surveyed the six law schools in Tennessee 
on their pro bono work done in 2014.

●  Belmont  College  of  Law:    In  2014,  60%  of  Belmont  University  College  of  Law 
students  participated  in  pro  bono  activities.    Leadership  members  of  all  student 
organizations  including  the  Student  Bar  Association  are  required  to  do  some  pro 
bono  service.    About  75%  of  the  faculty  engages  in  pro  bono  activities,  and  the 
students are widely encouraged to participate.  The encouragement surfaces as the 
school  hosts  different  pro  bono  events  such  as  the  TBA’s  Access  to  Justice  Pro 
Bono Summit and collaboration with www.onlinetnjustice.org.  Students have worked 
in  collaboration  with  the  following  organizations  and  projects:  Justice  For  Our 
Neighbors, Magdalene, Sophia’s Heart, Tennessee Justice Center, Court Appointed 
Special  Advocates  (CASA),  the  Legal  Aid  Society  of  Middle  Tennessee  and  the 
Cumberlands,  Volunteer  Lawyers  &  Professionals  for  the  Arts,  a  clinic  by  Waller 
Lansden and Shade Tree MLP. 

  Duncan  School  of  Law:  Law  students  are  required  to  complete  30  hours  of  pro 
bono  services  to  graduate.  Each  member  of  the  faculty  is  required  to  complete  20 
hours of pro bono per year to be considered for tenure.

  Nashville  School  of  Law:    All  students  are  part-time,  and  many  work  in  law-
related  jobs  during  the  day.    The  school  does  not  currently  track  all  their  pro  bono 
activities.  At the present time, approximately 10-15% of the students are involved in 
school-related pro bono activities.  There is no mandatory pro bono requirement at 
this time, but the school encourages students to participate in pro bono activities to 
the  extent

expectation that faculty will engage in pro bono activities.  Most of the professors are 
practitioners and work in some law-related field during the day.  Three members of 
the faculty help organize the students’ pro bono opportunities. Examples of projects 
include preparing  wills for  persons  receiving  housing  through  Habitat for  Humanity, 
and  the  representation  of  clients  in  general  sessions  cases.    In  the  future,  a  new

●   University  of  Tennessee  College  of  Law:  In  2014,  43%  of  UT  College  of  Law 
students  participated  in  pro  bono  activities,  which  represents  161  students.    The 
number  of  pro  bono  hours  reported  was  8,764,  which  is  a  record  for  the  school.  
During UT’s “Graduate and Professional Student Appreciation Week,” UT Pro Bono 
was recognized by the Vice Chancellor Ricky Hall and Dr. Ferlin McGaskey for the 
exceptional service the program provides to the community.  The Dean participated

in pro bono activities through the actual provision of services and from a support and 
advertising  standpoint.    Examples  of  pro  bono  projects  include  an  expungement 
clinic,  an  alternative  spring  break  project,  volunteering  with  Online  Tennessee 
Justice, volunteering with multiple projects for Legal Aid of East Tennessee, working 
with various public defenders offices and attorney general offices, and over 40 other 
organizations.  UT College of Law is exploring new opportunities to collaborate with 
other  law  schools  and  new  service  providers  in  Memphis,  Nashville,  Chattanooga, 
and  Johnson  City.    UT  College  of  Law  has  a  long-term  goal  of  reaching  50% 
participation level by 2016. 

  University  of  Memphis  Cecil  C.  Humphreys  School  of  Law:    In  2014, 
approximately  40%  of  University  of  Memphis  students  participated  in  pro  bono 
activities.  Memphis has a mandatory Pro Bono Program that requires all students to 
volunteer  40  hours  before  graduating.    Examples  of  pro  bono  projects  in  2014 
include  volunteering  with  Memphis  Area  Legal  Services,  Memphis  Immigration 
Court, Online Tennessee Justice, an Advanced Directives Clinic, a Veteran’s Court 
and  Clinic,  various  offices  with  the  Shelby  County  court  system,  and  Wills  for 
Heroes.  Memphis is developing a Healthy Homes Partnership with the Health Law 
Program to partner with hospitals to work on solving medical and legal issues.

●  Vanderbilt University:  Vanderbilt offers five  different clinical programs. Pro bono 
organizations  include  Vanderbilt  Legal  Aid  Society  and  Law  Students  for  Social 
Justice.  Externship  programs,  stipends  for  internships,  and  post-graduate  stipends 
are available, as well as loan repayment assistance. 

Legal Service Providers – Legal Services Corporation (“LSC”)-Funded 

In  Tennessee,  there  are  four  legal  aid  providers  that  receive  federal  funding  from  the 
Legal Services Corporation (“LSC”): Legal Aid of East Tennessee, Legal Aid Society of 
Middle  Tennessee  and  the  Cumberlands,  Memphis  Area  Legal  Services,  and  West 
Tennessee Legal  Services.  In  October  2011,  the  Access to  Justice  Commission  Chair 
and  the  Access  to  Justice  Coordinator  met  with  the  executive  directors  of  these 
organizations  to  begin  an  ongoing  discussion  about  how  the  Access  to  Justice 
Commission  and  the  LSC-funded  legal  aid  providers  can  collaborate  to  increase  pro 
bono assistance provided by Tennessee attorneys. The Access to Justice Commission 
Chair now holds quarterly conference calls with these directors. 

According to federal regulations, LSC-funded legal aid providers must use at least 12.5 
percent of their LSC funds for Private Attorney Involvement (pro bono). Each of the four 
LSC-funded  organizations  has  at  least  one  Pro  Bono  Coordinator/Director.  The 

 

 

   

 

 

16 
 

coordinators provide a wide range of services and interact with a variety of partners to 
provide  assistance  to  substantial  numbers  of  clients.  These  services  range  from 
arranging  classic  attorney-client  representation  to  providing  unbundled  services.  The 
coordinators  also  provide  support  services  for  pro  bono  activities  such  as  intake, 
referrals  to  a  variety  of  programs,  continuing  legal  education,  malpractice  coverage, 
legal clinics, partnering with bar associations to highlight the profession’s commitment to 
access to justice, recognition activities, and numerous other activities. 

General  information  gathered  from  the  four  LSC-funded  organizations’  directors  and 
websites  is  provided  below.  A  chart  detailing  pro  bono  opportunities  and  pro  bono 
statistics for the organizations is attached as Exhibit B. 

•   Legal  Aid  of  East  Tennessee  (LAET):  LAET  has  been  part  of  the  community 
structure of East Tennessee for over 40 years, serving 26 counties from Hamilton 
County to Johnson County. LAET has six offices with locations in Chattanooga, 
Maryville, Johnson City, Morristown, and two offices in Knoxville (Family Justice 
Center  and  LAET  office).  There  are  Pro  Bono  Directors  in  the  Knoxville  and 
Chattanooga offices.  
 

•  Legal  Aid  Society  of  Middle  Tennessee  and  the  Cumberlands  (LASMTC): 
LASMTC  serves  48  Tennessee  counties  with  its  eight  offices:  Clarksville, 
Columbia,  Cookeville,  Gallatin,  Murfreesboro,  Nashville,  Oak  Ridge,  and 
Tullahoma.  To  qualify  for  assistance  from  the  Legal  Aid  Society  of  Middle 
Tennessee  and  the  Cumberlands,  clients  must  be  at  least  60  years  of  age  or 
from a low-income household. People living outside the Nashville office’s service 
area are instructed to call the LAS office serving their county to find out about pro 
bono  opportunities.  LASMTC  has  a  full-time  Pro  Bono  Director  in  the  Nashville 
office. 

he  Nashville  office  has  the  most  pro  bono  resources.  In  addition  to  providing 
legal  counsel  for  nonprofit  organizations,  LASMTC  will  accept  cases  in  the 
following  areas:  domestic  violence,  family  law,  employment  (federal  income  tax 
disagreements,  wage  claims,  discrimination,  job  training  courses),  health

Legal Service Providers – Non-LSC-Funded 

In Tennessee, there are many legal service providers that do not receive funding from 
the  Legal  Services  Corporation.  The  Tennessee  ATJ  Commission  considers  any 
organization that does not receive funding from the Legal Services Corporation a non-
LSC-funded legal service provider. Non-LSC-funded organizations can serve segments 
of the population and handle legal matters that LSC-funded providers cannot. Non-LSC-
funded organizations do not have to follow federal income guidelines to determine if a 
person is eligible to receive legal services.  

The  Commission  has  gathered  data  from  the  following  non-LSC  providers:  Disability 
Rights  Tennessee,  Southern  Migrant  Legal  Services,  the  Tennessee  Justice  Center, 
and Tennessee Volunteer Lawyers and Professionals for the Arts.   A chart detailing the 
pro bono opportunities and pro bono statistics of each provider is attached as Exhibit C. 

on-LSC-Funded Legal Service Provider Highlights 

•  Over 425 of the organizations’ clients were help by pro bono attorneys. 

•  Volunteer Lawyers and Professionals for the Arts had 260 volunteers in 2014. 

Tennessee Faith & Justice Alliance Members 

   

 

he Tennessee  Faith and  Justice  Alliance  (TFJA)  is  a program  developed by  the ATJ 
Commission to support and encourage faith-based groups in Tennessee who commit to 
providing  legal  resources  to  their  congregations  and  communities.    It’s  one  of  the  first 
programs of its kind in the country created to align needs seen at the local church level 
with  possible  legal  resources  that  are  nearby,  perhaps  even  within  the  same 
congregation.  The notion is to connect with people in need in a place they already go to 
seek help with a problem. That place is quite often their place of worship. 

he  pilot  project  involved  the  Tennessee  Conference  of  the  United  Methodist  Church. 
Church  leaders  and  volunteer  attorneys  gathered  to  learn  more  about  the  program, 
assign attorneys to congregations, and receive training on how the program works. The 
United Methodist Church’s TFJA project is designed to pair an attorney with a place of 
worship.  When  a  leader  or  clergy  member  of  that  congregation  learns  of  a  member’s

      T

19 
 

legal  need,  that  leader  can  then  refer  the  person  to  the  local  attorney  who  has 
volunteered  to  serve  as  a  resource  to  that  congregation.  That  attorney  in  turn  will 
provide  the  legal  advice  needed,  or  make  connections  with  other  resources  that  can 
provide the necessary services.  

he TFJA  program  is expanding  to  all faiths  and  geographic areas  of  the  state  and is 
flexible  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  particular  community.  For  example,  the  Knoxville  Bar 
Association co-sponsored a regional training event in September to introduce attorneys 
and faith leaders to the TFJA.  The UMC model is just one way to offer services. Other 
organizations  may  consider  monthly  legal  clinics  or  other  offerings.    For  example,  the 
Lipscomb  Institute  for  Law,  Justice  and  Society  recruited  alumni  attorneys  to  serve  at 
monthly  free  walk-in  legal  clinics.  Other  organizations  ask  attorneys  to  educate 
parishioners  about  issues  common  to  the  congregation  such  as  consumer  debt  and 
home foreclosure issues. The Commission surveyed member organizations of the TFJA 
about  the  pro  bono  initiatives  and  efforts  sponsored  by  each  organization.    A  chart 
containing  information  about  each  TFJA  member,  including  its  pro  bono  statistics,  is 
attached as Exhibit D. 

FJA Survey Highlights  

•  Lipscomb  University  Legal  Clinic  provides  a  free  legal  advice  clinic  at  the  St. 
James  Missionary  Baptist  Church  in  Nashville,  TN.    The  clinic  served  over  45

Pro Bono Legal Advice Clinics 

he  ATJ  Commission,  in  its  2014  Strategic  Plan,  set  a  goal  to  have  at  least  one 
recurring pro bono legal advice clinic in each of the 31 judicial districts in Tennessee by 
March  2016.    To  date,  there  are  six  judicial  districts  without  legal  clinics.    The 
Commission  maintains  a  list  of  clinics  across  the  state  and  makes  that  information 
available  online  on  the  access  to  justice  website,  www.justiceforalltn.com.    The  2014 
Pro  Bono  Report  is  the  first  time  that  the  Commission  sought  information  from  clinic 
providers as a stand-alone category.  Some of the clinic providers fall into other Report

Attorney for Justice and Law Student for Justice Pro Bono Recognition 

n 2014, the Supreme Court recognized attorneys who devoted 50 or more hours of pro 
bono  service  for  the  2013  calendar  year  as  Attorneys  for  Justice.    The  attorneys  who 
were recognized reported over 10,000 hours of pro bono service provided in 2013.  The 
Supreme  Court  also  recognized  2014  law  school  graduates  who  provided  50  or  more 
hours  of  pro  bono  work  during  their  law  school  career.    There  were  95  law  students 
recognized as Law Students for Justice.  The law students provided over 4,750 hours of 
pro bono service.   
 

Law Offices with Pro Bono Policies, Pillar Law Firms, and  
Attorney for Justice Law Offices 

or the first time, law offices that have adopted pro bono policies were surveyed for the 
annual pro bono report.  As part of its 2012 Strategic Plan, the Commission set a goal to 
increase  the  number  of  law  offices  with  pro  bono  policies  by  fifteen.    When  the 
Commission  set  this  goal,  there  were  approximately  fifty  law  offices  across  the  state

Supreme Court Rule 31 Mediator Pro Bono and Mediation Center Pro Bono 

Supreme  Court  Rule  31  is  a  system  where  litigants,  courts,  and  attorneys  can  locate 
qualified  alternative  dispute  resolution  mediators  and  other  neutrals  and  enlist  their 
assistance in resolving matters pending before courts of record.  Rule 31 does not affect 
dispute  resolution  programs  or  individual  cases  that  are  resolved  outside  the  Rule  31 
system.  The Rule was set up in 1996 to assist the court in obtaining a mediator or other 
neutral when the court or the parties want one.  Rule 31 also established the Alternative 
Dispute Resolution Commission that devised a way that ADR neutrals could be trained 
and approved for use by the courts.  The Rule provides required credentials and training 
for mediators who wish to be listed as a Supreme Court Rule 31 Mediator.  All Rule 31 
Mediators  are  required  to  file  a  report  after  each  mediation  they  conduct.    If  the 
mediation is done pro bono, this must be noted in the report.  In 2014, there were 325 
pro  bono  mediations  reported  by  Rule  31  Mediators.    There  were  six  additional  court-
ordered pro bono mediations reported in 2014.  This total may or  may not include pro 
bono  mediations  that  were  conducted  through  the  Tennessee  Community  Mediation 
Centers.          

Tennessee Community Mediation Centers providing Pro Bono Mediation 

n  Tennessee,  there  are  non-profit  mediation  centers  that  provide  pro  bono  mediation 
services  to  low-income  residents  across  the  state.    These  centers  are  known  as 
Community Mediation Centers, or CMCs.  CMCs partner with local courts to provide a 
range of free or low-cost (sliding scale) mediations to those who are most vulnerable in 

  I

22 
 

the  court  system  -  namely,  pro  se  litigants  or  people  without  legal  representation.  
CMCs also work pro-actively to resolve disputes at the early intervention stage (outside 
of  the  courts)  so  as  to  prevent  litigation.    The  AOC  supports  these  centers  through 
limited  grant  funding  designed  to  increase  low-income  Tennesseans'  access  to 
mediation services.  The Tennessee General Assembly established the Victim Offender 
Mediation  Program  (VORP)  in  1993  to  provide  funding  support  for  the  state's  earliest 
non-profit  mediation  centers.    In  the  2013-2014  fiscal  year,  eleven  agencies  received 
VORP  grant  funding.    Those  agencies  reported  conducting  1,259  mediations  to  the 
AOC under their VORP grants.   

he AOC administers another state-funded grant, the Parent Education and Mediation 
Fund  (PEMF)  pursuant  to  Supreme  Court  Rule  38  and  T.C.A.  §6-6-413.    The  AOC 
distributes  funds  to  grantees  to  provide  education  and  mediation  for  indigent  parents 
involved  in  absolute  divorce,  legal  separation,  annulment,  or  separate  maintenance 
proceedings,  and  any  other  custody  matters.    In  the 2013-2014 fiscal  year,  seventeen 
agencies received PEMF funding.  The agencies which received funding for mediation 
services reported providing services benefitting 400 parents and 217 children.  

  T

The  Pro  Bono  Coordinator  surveyed  current  VORP  and  PEMF  grantees  to  obtain 
additional information on their pro bono efforts in 2014.  To date, the following mediation 
center  providers  have  responded:  Nashville  Conflict  Resolution  Center;  Mid-South 
Mediation  Services;  Mediation  &  Restitution/Reconciliation  Services;  The  Exchange 
Club  Family  Center;  First  Judicial  District  Court  Clinic;  Tomorrow’s  Hope  Pregnancy 
Medical  Clinic;  Southeast  Tennessee  Human  Resource  Agency;  Community  Health  of 
East  Tennessee  –  Community  Health  Mediation;  Community  Mediation  Services; 
Neighborhood  Reconciliation  Services,  Inc.;  Community  Reconciliation,  Inc.;  and  The 
Mediation Center.  These agencies reported serving 2,755 clients through mediation in 
2014.

ennessee is making great strides in encouraging more attorneys to provide more 
hours of pro bono each year.   This pro bono report demonstrates the impact of pro 
bono  initiatives  and  documents  the  great  work  of  our  access  to  justice  partners.  
The Commission urges attorneys to continue to track and report the many activities 
in which they have provided pro bono representation.   

ccess to justice cannot be achieved without collaboration. The multiple partners of 
the Court and the Commission include but are not limited to the many volunteers on 
the Commission's numerous committees and work groups, attorneys, legal services 
organizations,  bar  associations,  law  schools  and  law  students,  mediators,  judges, 
and  countless  volunteers  involved  in  providing  day-to-day  assistance  to  those 
needing legal services within their communities.  

Conclusion 

 T

  A

Tennesseans have responded to the civil legal needs gap by donating time, talent, 
and treasure to pro bono services, programs, and projects. They have provided pro 
bono  assistance  by  directly  providing  legal  services  at  no  cost  or  at  substantially 
reduced rates to low-income Tennesseans, by providing legal services to non-profit 
organizations  serving  persons  of  limited  means,  by  providing  legal  services  to 
groups  and  organizations  at  a  reduced fee when  payment  of  standard fees  would 
create a financial hardship, and by providing legal services to improve the law, the 
legal system, or the legal profession. 

Thanks  to  the  generosity  of  so  many,  Access  to  Justice  has  become  a  reality  for 
many low-income Tennesseans.

What are the pro bono legal needs of

In my opinion, to get the word out that 
local lawyers can rely on our pro bono 
activities and not feel the burden of 
trying to build pro bono into their 
practices.  I'm not sure that, being in a 
rural area, we have the maximum 
participation because attorneys feel like 
they do pro bono every day or that our 
clinics take away business.    As far as 
potential clients, we have a large 
number of indigent persons who are in 
need of family law advice, custody 
issues, Tenncare problems, 
disability/social security issues, and 
need estate help.

Volunteer Lawyers & 
Professionals for the Arts (VLPA) 
provides pro bono legal 
assistance to low-income artists 
from all creative disciplines, as 
well as legal and business 
services to emerging non-profit 
arts organizations.

Entertainment, Intellectual 
Property, Nonprofit, 
Employment, Corporate, 
Litigation.  Most common 
services include copyright 
matters, reviewing contracts, 
filing trademarks, employment 
issues, helping to resolve all 
manner of arts-related disputes. VLPA is an ongoing project.

We plan to continue the VLPA 
program and also host some 
Saturday legal clinics each 
year.

Consistent volunteer help from 
recent law grads; Funding.

While better publicity for free 
CLE trainings would be helpful, 
recruiting attorneys after they 
have been trained to take pro 
bono cases remains the most 
immediate and pressing 
challenge. 

If local legal services providers 
offered more services in areas 
that they could serve but 
currently do not serve, such as 
in employment and immigration, 
where there is a high need but 
which applicants are turned 
away

Disability Rights Tennessee

Disability Rights.  Our disability 
rights work is currently focused 
on the following issues:   1. 
Abuse and neglect in 
institutional and community 
settings  2. Appropriate 
functional behavior assessments 
and behavior intervention plans 
for students in K-12   3.  
Appropriate Implementation of 
IEPs and 504 plans for students 
in K-12  4.  Access to Vocational 
Rehabilitation services  5.  
Access to assistive technology  
6.  Communication barriers in 
business, government, and 
healthcare settings  7. 
Discriminatory policies and 
practices

NA.  Because our organization 
provides free legal services to 
people with disabilities, we are 
typically the beneficiary of time 
donated by pro bono attorneys.  
We currently have 3 pro bono 
attorneys who assist our staff 
attorneys with case and project 
activities on an ongoing basis.  In 
addition, our agency's attorneys 
do regularly provide technical 
support to legal services 
attorneys and outside pro bono 
attorneys who are working to 
address disability rights issues.

Disability Rights Tennessee 
(DRT) is a nonprofit legal 
services organization dedicated 
to protecting the rights of 
Tennesseans with disabilities.  
Our agency provides the 
following services:  information 
and referral  investigation of 
abuse and neglect  advocacy 
services  legal representation  
education and outreach  public 
policy advocacy

Our current pro bono attorneys 
and student interns have 
increased our ability to serve 
clients. However, due to limited 
resources, we remain unable to 
address all disability rights 
issues we are contacted about.  
Additional funding and staff 
would help us better fulfill our 
mission.

We plan to continue our current 
activities,

Adams and Reese LLP

Attorneys are pushed to provide 20+ hours of 
pro bono service per year.

How does the firm encourage attorneys to 
do pro bono work?

Regular reporting; providing cases and 
opportunities for attorneys to handle so 
attorneys don't have to seek them out.

We provide billable credit for up to 100 hours 
of pro bono, plus additional hours for junior 
associates and for extraordinary time 
commitments. We have a dedicated pro bono 
shareholder who oversees our pro bono 
program and focuses on bringing a wide 
range of pro bono opportunities to our 
attorneys. We give firmwide and office pro 
bono awards each year.

Providing opportunities, recognzing attorneys 
and staff who work on pro bono, and giving 
billable hour credit for staff attorneys and 
associates who take pro bono matters.

Baker Donelson

Bass Berry & Sims

The attorneys are involved in a wide range of 
organizations and activities, including 
nonprofits that support access to healthcare, 
children, the arts, education, and social and 
economic advancements. Whether they are 
helping one of those associations with legal 
matters or lending their services to those who 
lack the resources to hire a lawyer, our team 
of attorneys make invaluable contributions to 
the access of justice. They are well-versed in 
the ever-changing issues and laws governing 
nonprofits and support in our community.

Our firm is proud of its involvement in many 
pro bono and nonprofit activities. A pro bono 
committee of 4 attorneys monitors our firm's 
specific service, but all of our attorneys 
enthusiastically participate in pro bono 
activities.

How does the firm encourage attorneys to 
do pro bono work?

We encourage all attorneys to participate in 
pro bono matters. Associates are especially 
encouraged to gain interviewing and trial 
experience. All lawyers have an ethical 
obligation to help address the unmet   legal 
needs of indigent individuals and charitable 
institutions. Accordingly, the Firm expects its 
lawyers   to devote a significant amount of 
time to pro bono work. The Firm is a member 
of the Pro Bono Institute   and a challenge 
member of the ABA's Law Firm Pro Bono 
Project. As such, the Firm aspires to devote   
three percent of firm billable hours to pro 
bono matters.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
