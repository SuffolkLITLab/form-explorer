Approved by: Chief Justice Frank F. Drowota, III and Cornelia A. Clark, Director 
Subject: Interchange, designation, and substitution of trial and appellate court judges 

 

 

 

 

Authority: Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 17-2-109, 17-2-201 et seq. and Supreme 
Court Rule 11. 

Purpose:  To ensure uniformity of the procedures used in the interchange 
and designation of trial court judges. 
 
Application:   Trial court judges and appellate court judges, as noted. 

 

V. 

Definitions: None. 

. 

Policy:  

A.  Interchange generally: Each state trial court judge has an affirmative 
duty to interchange if: (1) a judge has died or is unable to hold court; 
(2) two or more judges have agreed to a mutually convenient 
interchange; (3) the judge is incompetent under the provisions of Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 17-2-101; or (4) the Chief Justice has assigned by order a 
judge of another court pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 11.  Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 17-2-202(a). 

 

A judge or chancellor holding court in the circuit or division of another 
shall have the same power and jurisdiction as the judge or chancellor 
in whose place he or she is acting.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-206. 

B.  Interchange in certain divorce actions:  In counties having a population 
of over 700,000, general sessions judges may sit by interchange as a 
circuit court judge or chancellor for the exclusive purpose of hearing 
and deciding uncontested and irreconcilable differences in divorce 
cases. Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-209(a).  

C.  Designation generally:  Whenever litigation in chancery, circuit, civil, or 

appellate courts becomes congested or delay in the disposition 
becomes imminent for any reason or upon request by any chancellor 
or judge, the Chief Justice shall assign a retired or regular chancellor 
or judge to assist in the removal of such congestion or delay. Such

assignment shall not materially interfere with the performance of the 
assigned judge’s official duties.  

Any judge has the discretion to request another judge to assist in the 
removal of congestion or delay if the original judge becomes aware of 
the need for such assistance before the Chief Justice makes the 
assignment. In such situations, both the requesting judge and the 
assigned judge may hear, try and dispose of cases in such court at the 
same time, both signing their respective minutes. Tenn. Code Ann. § 
17-2-109. 

D.  Duties of Presiding Judges:  To reduce delays, correct caseload 

imbalances, and to promote the orderly and efficient administration of 
justice, the presiding judge may assign cases to judges and 
chancellors within his or her district.  If the presiding judge is unable to 
correct an imbalance or reduce docket delays utilizing the available 
judges within the district, it is his or her affirmative duty to contact other 
presiding judges and request assistance or contact the Administrative 
Office of the Courts for assistance pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-
3-502(3).  Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-2-509(d) and (e). 

E.  Designation and Use of Referees/Appointed Officers of the  Judicial 
System:  In addition to the statutory provisions governing the referee 
and clerk and master positions, the referee or clerk and master can be 
used as a lawyer substitute judge in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. 
§§17-2-118(f) and 17-2-122(b).  Such appointed judicial officers shall 
serve as a special judge only in matters related to their duties as 
judicial officers.  Designation of referees or clerks and masters by the 
Chief Justice is not required in such cases.   

In counties with a metropolitan form of government and a population 
over 500,000, the circuit court judges may appoint a full-time master to 
serve as a judicial officer in the absence of one of the judges.  Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 17-2-123. 

F.  Immunity for Judges:  Any judge or lawyer specially appointed 

pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-109 or Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-15-
209 or by interchange shall have the same immunity as the judge for 
whom the judge or lawyer is sitting. The county where the special 
judge or lawyer is sitting shall be required to provide the defense.  
Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-1-114.  

G.  Expenses: The expenses of the chancellor, judge or appellate judge 
who serves as assigned by the Chief Justice under Tenn. Code Ann. 
§§ 17-2-109 or 17-2-110, or the retired judge designated under Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 16-3-502(2) shall be certified by the chancellor, judge, 
appellate or retired judge pursuant to policies and guidelines 
promulgated by the Supreme Court.  Such expenses shall be paid in 

addition to the regular salary of the judge.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-
111.  

VI. 

H.  Oaths:  Every special judge, before entering on the duties of the 

judge’s appointment, shall take an oath before the clerk of the court 
and file such oath with the clerk.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-120. 

 
Procedures: Where a judge of a trial court of record is incompetent to try 
any case pending before that judge, as provided in Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-
2-202, or the judge of a trial court of record fails to attend or is unable to 
hold court, as provided in Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-118, the following 
procedure shall be followed, in the sequence designated, for the selection 
of a substitute judge:  

.  The judge shall seek interchange in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. 

§ 17-2-201 et seq.  

.  The judge shall apply to the presiding judge of the judicial district to 

effect an interchange with a judge of that judicial district in accordance 
with Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-2-509(d). 

.  The presiding judge of the judicial district shall effect an interchange 
with a judge from another judicial district in accordance with Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 16-2-509(e). 

.  The presiding judge shall request from the director of the 

Administrative Office of the Courts the designation of a judge by the 
Chief Justice, in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 16-3-502(3)(A) 
and 17-2-110.  

.  If a judge is disqualified by reason of a conflict of interest or other  

circumstance where the judge’s impartiality in choosing another judge 
to sit as special  judge could be questioned, the judge should apply to 
the Administrative Office of the Courts for assistance in finding a judge 
to sit by interchange or designation.  See Supreme Court Rule 10, 
Canon 3(E) regarding disqualification. 

  
F.  The Administrative Office of the Courts, absent special circumstances, 
cannot secure a replacement when the regular judge’s absence results 
from: 

 A

1.  attendance at a conference, educational seminar or speaking

judge rotates off the bench to handle administrative matters. 

II.     Alternate Procedure: Lawyer as Substitute Judge: Only if the procedures 
set forth above fail to provide a judge to preside over the docket or case 
will a judge appoint a lawyer to preside as a substitute judge pursuant to 
Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-118. Appointments pursuant to this section will 
conform to the following requirements:  

   

 V

 

Subject: Interchange, designation, and substitution of trial 
and appellate court judges 

Index #: 4.01  Page 4 of 5 

A.  An attorney who is appointed substitute judge must possess all the 

qualifications of a judge, including the age and residency 
requirements, and the attorney must be in good standing under the 
rules of the Supreme Court. The substitute judge shall be subject to 
the applicable provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct, including 
Canon 8.  

.  The substitute judge shall take an oath of office as  provided in Tenn. 

Code Ann. § 17-2-120, and the substitute judge shall certify 
compliance with this rule by affixing his or her signature to the 
substitute judge consent form.  

 B

C.  The authority of a substitute judge to fix fees pursuant to Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 17-2-118 is limited to cases in which the exact amount of the 
fee is set by statute.  

D.  The substitute judge must ensure that all litigants who are present at 
the beginning of each proceeding give their consent to the use of a 
substitute judge in their case. All litigants who are present at the 
beginning of the proceedings in a case and the attorneys of record 
for all parties who consent to the service of the substitute judge must 
complete Part B of the substitute judge consent form. Without such 
consent, the substitute judge shall not preside on that case. Part C of 
the substitute judge consent form must be completed by the 
substitute judge in each case on which that judge presides.  

E.  The incompetent or absent judge must complete Part A of the 

substitute judge consent form. The judge must specify the reason for 
his or her incompetence or absence. If the judge cites absence for a 
cause other than a reason listed in Tenn. Code Ann. § 17-2-118(a), 
the specific reason for the absence must be set forth on the form.  

F.  The clerk of the court shall certify that the appointment was made 

and that the substitute judge took the statutory oath of office and that 
the oath of office was filed in the clerk's office. The certification shall 
be made on Part D of the substitute judge consent form.  

 

 

 

 

 

G.  At the end of each month, all substitute judge consent forms will be 

transmitted by the presiding judge of the judicial district to the 
Administrative Office of the Courts where they will be available for 

Subject: Interchange, designation, and substitution of trial

public inspection during regular business hours. Such forms shall be 
maintained on file at the Administrative Office of the Courts for at 
least eight (8) years after they are received. Supreme Court Rule 11. 

III.    Senior and Retired Judges: 

A.  The utilization of senior and retired judges as replacements in the 

trial and appellate courts must be scheduled through the 
Administrative Office of the Courts.
