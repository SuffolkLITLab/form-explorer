Rhode Island

Superior Court 

Alice Bridget Gibney 

Presiding Justice  

October 2022 

WHAT DOES THE COURT DO? 

The  Superior  Court  is  the  trial  court  of  general  jurisdiction  in 

the  Rhode  Island  unified  state  court  system,  having  original 

jurisdiction in all felony proceedings, in civil matters where the amount 

in controversy exceeds $10,000, and in matters of equity.  Jurisdiction is 

concurrent with the District Court as to civil matters with amounts at 

issue from $5,000 - $10,000.  The Superior Court also hears appeals on 

civil  and  criminal  cases  from  the  District  Court.    It  has  concurrent 

jurisdiction  with  the  Supreme  Court  in  issuing  writs  of  habeas  corpus 

and  writs  of  mandamus.    Any  appeal  from  a  decision  rendered  in 

Superior Court is taken directly to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. 

Rhode Island’s five (5) counties are divided into four (4)  Superior 

Court 

jurisdictions:  Kent,  Washington,  and  Newport;  with 

Providence/Bristol counties comprising one (1) jurisdiction. 

Rhode  Island  does  not  have  a  single  trial  court;  however,  the 

Superior Court is the forum for a trial by jury and a stenographic record 

of proceedings.  Appeals from trials held in the District Court result in a 

trial de novo or entirely new trial in Superior Court. 

The Superior Court also has appellate jurisdiction of decisions of 

local  municipal  and  probate  courts.    Appeals  from  various  boards  and 

commissions, such as zoning board and Ethics Commission appeals, are 

heard in Superior Court as well as petitions to review disciplinary action 

imposed  upon  a  state  or  local  police  officer  by  the  chief  of  that 

department.   

1 

A special Gun Court Calendar, the first of its kind in the nation, 

heard its first gun case on September 12, 1994.  This innovative program 

has had a dramatic impact upon the time from filing such a case in the 

Superior Court to disposition, a reduction from eighteen (18) months to 

six and a half (6½) months.  The calendar is considered a great success 

both within Rhode Island and across the nation.   

In addition to conducting trials, the Superior Court administers the 

highly successful Court-Annexed Arbitration Program which speeds 

the  disposition  of  certain  less  complex  civil  cases  in  which  there  is 

$100,000  or  less  at  issue.    Matters  such  as  contract  disputes,  personal 

injury  claims,  and  property  damage  suits  may  be  certified  to  this 

alternative dispute resolution program. 

During an arbitration hearing, evidence is presented in an informal 

setting to a court-trained attorney/arbitrator who, after considering the 

same,  makes  an  award  in  the  case  usually  within  ten  (10)  days  of  the 

hearing.    Arbitration  not  only  speeds  case  resolution  but  also  saves 

litigants and taxpayers millions of dollars a year by eliminating many of 

the costs associated with lengthy, formal trials.  It also frees courtrooms 

and  allows  judges  to  concentrate  on  more  serious  or  complex  civil  and 

criminal cases.  Over the last five (5) years, 53% of those cases designated 

to court-annexed arbitration have resulted in disposition.  

Also administered through the Superior Court Arbitration Office is 

the annual “Settlement Week” which is held in Providence in December 

each year, during which civil cases may be resolved through mediation.  

Additional settlement weeks in the counties have been held with much 

2 

success, extending this option to cases filed outside of Providence.  Over 

the  last  five  (5)  years,  67%  of  those  cases  heard  were  settled  through 

mediation. 

In  2020,  the  court  established  a  Diversion  Program  in 

partnership with the office of the Rhode Island Attorney General.  The 

program  is  designed  to  offer  an  alternative  to  traditional  conviction, 

sentencing,  and  incarceration  by  providing  eligible  defendants  with  a 

framework  of  supervision  and  services  in  lieu  of  incarceration  and/or 

probation  to  help  them  make  informed  decisions,  engage  in  positive 

behavior, and reduce the risk of recidivism. 

WHO RUNS THE COURT? 

The  Presiding  Justice  of  the  Superior  Court 

is  the 

administrative  judge  of  the  court.    As  such,  the  Presiding  Justice  has 

responsibility for establishing calendars, assigning judges, appointing a 

Superior  Court  Administrator  and  other  administrative  staff,  and 

making  rules  for  the  conduct  of  the  court’s  business.    The  Presiding 

Justice also appoints a Jury Commissioner and all staff for various offices 

including but not limited to the Case Scheduling Offices, Clerk’s Offices, 

the Arbitration Office, the Diversion Office, and the Central Registry. 

The Presiding Justice of the Superior Court is assisted by twenty-

one (21) Associate Justices as well as five (5)  Magistrates, the Superior 

Court  Administrator, 

the  Superior  Court  Clerk’s, 

the  Jury 

Commissioner, and various administrative staff. 

3 

 

Judicial  appointments  are  made  by  the  Governor  following  a 

recommendation  of  three  (3)  to  five  (5)  candidates  by  the  Judicial 

Nominating  Commission  to  the  Governor  and  confirmation  by  the 

Senate of the Governor’s choice.  Appointments are for life in the absence 

of judicial misconduct.  Complaints about such misconduct are heard by 

the Judicial Tenure and Discipline Commission. 

The  Super  Court  conducts  its  own  judicial  evaluation  program, 

distributing  questionnaires  about  judicial  performance  to  jurors  and 

attorneys practicing before the court. 

THE SUPERIOR COURT CLERK’S OFFICE 

There  are  four  (4)  locations  of  the  Clerk’s  Office  throughout  the 

state,  corresponding  to  the  four  (4)  Superior  Court  jurisdictions:  

Providence/Bristol, Kent, Washington, and Newport (see last page of this 

booklet  for  addresses  and  telephone  numbers).    Rhode  Island  General 

Law § 8-4-4 establishes a County Clerk for each of these jurisdictions. 

The Clerk is the custodian of all criminal and civil cases filed in 

the Superior Court.  The Clerk’s Office is responsible for receiving and 

storing all documents and other materials that make up a Superior Court 

case file.  The Clerk is also custodian of the Superior Court seal. 

All Superior Court hearings are attended by courtroom clerks from 

the Clerk’s Office.  Computer entries are made by Clerk’s Office staff for 

all court proceedings.  Fines, costs, and civil case fees are collected and 

accounted  for  by  the  Clerk’s  Office,  which  also  serves  as  a  primary 

4 

 

 

   

 

 

 

resource  where  attorneys  and  members  of  the  public  can  gather 

information on Superior Court cases. 

ABOUT JURY DUTY 

The petit jury is the panel of twenty-five (25) to  thirty-two (32) 

25-32  jurors  from  which  fourteen  (14)  jurors  are  selected  for  criminal 

trials (twelve (12) plus two (2) alternates) and from which eight (8) are 

chosen for civil trials (six (6) plus two (2) alternates).  Petit jurors serve 

for a two-day period in Providence/Bristol and Kent Counties, longer if a 

trial for which they  are  sitting extends  beyond two  (2) days.   Over the 

last five (5) years 12,855 jurors were summoned for petit jury duty. 

 

The Superior Court has implemented a one-day, one-trial system 

in  Washington  and  Newport  Counties  to  make  more  efficient  use  of 

jurors’ time.  This system of requiring jurors to serve for either one-day 

or for the duration of one-trial permits those not selected to serve on a 

case to be dismissed at the end of their first day.  Similarly, a two-day, 

one-trial  system  has  recently  been  established  for  Providence/Bristol 

and Kent Counties.  This program is a cost saving measure and is also 

beneficial to employers, as employees can fulfill their civic obligation with 

a minimal amount of time away from work. 

All Grand Jury indictments charging defendants with a crime are 

returned to Superior Court by the Attorney General.  The Grand Jury 

consists of not  more than  twenty-three  (23) nor less  than thirteen  (13) 

individuals who decide whether sufficient evidence has been presented 

5 

 

   

 

 

to return a true bill against a defendant.  If a true bill is returned, the 

Attorney  General  must  then  indict,  bringing  charges  against  that 

defendant in Superior Court.   

As  an  alternative  to  indictment,  the  process  of  information 

charging  was  created  through  a  state  constitutional  amendment  in 

1973.  This allows a defendant to be charged by an affidavit brought by a 

police department to the Attorney General.  Charges may also be brought 

by the Attorney General himself/herself.  Since this procedure eliminates 

the use of the Grand Jury, it saves time for witnesses and police while 

providing safeguards to individuals charged with a crime.  Grand Jury 

indictments are still required for the most serious felonies, called capital 

offenses,  because  they  involve  the  possibility  of  life  imprisonment:  

namely murder, rape, robbery, and burglary. 

USE OF TECHNOLOGY 

he  Superior  Court  has  a  fully  operational  video  conferencing 

system  used  to  conduct  video  presentments  during  the  daily  criminal 

calendar.  The video conferencing system increases safety for those who 

use  the  courthouse  and  provides  substantial  savings  in  inmate 

transportation costs from prison to court. 

The Superior Court also has assistive listening devices available for 

the  hearing  impaired.    These  may  be  utilized  by  contacting  the 

Administrative Office in advance.
