APPELLATE MEDIATION PROGRAM 

MEDIATION STATEMENT 

INSTRUCTIONS 

Revised November 2021 
 

This is a two-part form.  Part I determines the appropriateness of your case for mediation.  Part II contains 
confidential information about your case in order to assist the mediator in a resolution as well as an authorization 
to mediate.   
 

1.  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 35, if a case is eligible for participation in the Supreme Court Appellate 
Mediation Program, a Notice of Eligibility will be sent to all parties. If a case is not eligible for mediation 
pursuant to Rule 35, parties will receive a notice of ineligibility and the case will proceed in accordance 
with the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure.    

a.  Eligible cases generally include all civil cases that have been appealed from a trial court. 

b.  The following case types are not eligible for participation in the program: (i) applications for post-
conviction relief; (b) petitions for habeas corpus; (c) cases brought by prisoners in the custody of 
the Department of Corrections; (d) cases in which one (1) or more parties are not represented by 
an attorney (unless the case is specifically included at the direction of the Supreme Court or by 
order of a mediator justice); (e) appeals from the Family Court; (f) juvenile cases; (g) petitions for 
extraordinary  relief,  including  all  prerogative  writs  (except  that  prerogative  writs  brought 
originally in the Supreme Court may be assigned to the program by order of the Court at the time 
the writ is issued); and (h) all criminal cases (including cases on review from traffic tribunals of 
the state or municipalities and adjudications of offenses by municipal courts). 

2.  All parties to eligible cases will be required to complete this Mediation Statement, comprised of Parts I 

and II, within twenty (20) days from the date of the Notice of Eligibility.   
 

3.  All parties must electronically file the Part I of the Mediation Statement (case information form) with the 
Appellate Mediation Program and simultaneously send a copy to all opposing counsel through File and 
Serve. Filing instructions are located at the end of the Part I form.  

4.  All    parties  must  electronically  file  Part  II  of  the  Mediation  Statement  (confidential  statement  and 
authorization).  Do NOT send a copy of Part II to opposing counsel. Filing instructions are located at 
the end of the Part II form.  

ully complete Part II inclusive of the confidentiality and negotiation authorization section.  Attach copies 
of the relevant orders, memoranda, and opinions from which this appeal has been taken.  If you are the 
appellant(s) or cross-appellant(s), you are required to attach copies of the trial court’s written decision(s) 
or order(s). While Part I is shared with opposing counsel, Part II provides parties with an opportunity to 
inform only the mediator of additional information that could lead to resolution.  Candor and honesty are 
strongly encouraged. 
 

5.  If  after  submission  of  the  Mediation  Statement,  it  is  determined  that  your  case  is  not  appropriate  for 
mediation, the parties will be notified by the Appellate Mediation Program and the case will proceed in 
accordance with the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure.   
 

 

  F

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.  If  after  submission  of  your  statements,  your  case  is  deemed  appropriate  for  mediation,  the  Appellate 
Mediation  Program  will  send  notice  of  the  scheduled  session  to  all  parties  along  with  instructions  on 
submitting a confidential memorandum to the mediator.  Please make every effort to have counsel and 
clients available on the assigned date and time.  MEDIATION SESSIONS ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO 
BE RESCHEDULED ONCE FOR GOOD CAUSE.  A request to reschedule must be made at least seven 
(7) days before the session. 
 

7.  To  adequately  prepare  for  mediation,  counsel  should  become  fully  aware  of  his/her  client’s  interests, 
goals,  and  needs  and  acquire  appropriate  authority  to  participate  in  the  mediation  conference  and  the 
potential settlement.  Counsel should further educate his/her client regarding the mediation process and 
its  possible  outcomes.    We  strongly  suggest  that  you  refer  to  the  Appellate  Mediation  Program’s 
“Mediation Tip Sheets” for counsel and clients in preparation for your session. 
 

8.  Please note that even if your case proceeds to mediation the Appellate Rules of Procedure are NOT 
suspended; only the time within which to order the transcript and transmit the record is extended.  
Should you need additional time, it is recommended that you file a motion with the Court for an extension. 
 

9.  If you have any questions, please contact us at the following:
