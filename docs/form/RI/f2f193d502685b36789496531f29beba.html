FREQUENTLY  ASKED QUESTIONS 

 
OVERDRAFT   IMPLEMENTATION   GUIDELINES  FOR FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS 
 

 

Question:  What  is  the  policy  of  the  Supreme  Court  Disciplinary  Board  with  respect  to  the 
financial  institutions  who  occasionally  fail  to  report  overdrafts  to  the  Board 
through  error? 

nswer:    Occasional  simple  negligence  in  failing  to  report  to  the  Disciplinary  Board  will  not 
cause  removal  from  the  list  of  approved  institutions.    However,  a  pattern  of  neglect  or 
showing  of  bad  faith  in  not  complying  with  the  rule  may  cause  the  Supreme  Court  to 
revoke  its  approval. 

uestion:  Can financial  institutions  charge attorneys a fee for providing  this notice? 

nswer:    Yes,  there  is  nothing  in  the  rule  to  prevent  charging  a  fee.    Charging  fees  is  a  matter 

of contract  between  the  institution  and the depositor. 

uestion:  Must all overdrafts  be reported? 

nswer:    Yes,  all  overdrafts  must  be  reported  irrespective  of  the  cause,  unless  the  financial 
institution  is  certain  at  the  time  notice  is  required  to  be  given  that  the  institution’s 
own  error  caused  that  matter  to  be  considered  an  overdraft.    Overdraft  reporting  must 
not  be  delayed  simply  because  the  financial  institution  is  uncertain  as  whether  it  has 
committed  an  error  which  has  resulted  in  an  overdraft  status.    If,  after  notification  is 
given,  however,  the  financial  institution  discovers  that  the  institution’s  error  caused 
the  overdraft,  it  should  provide  the  attorney  with  a  written  explanation  which  the 
attorney  can  submit  to  the  Disciplinary  Board.    The  attorney  will  then  be  requested  to 
explain. 
  Doubtless  by  the  time  the  attorney  receives  written  inquiry  from  the 
Disciplinary  Board,  the  attorney  will  have  already  communicated  with  the  financial 
institution  to  determine  the  cause  of  the  problem.    Naturally  any  explanation  from  the 
financial  institution  to  verify  any  error  that  may  have  caused  the  overdraft  will  be 
helpful  if  received  as soon as possible. 

uestion:  If  the  instrument  creates  an  overdraft  but  is  honored  by  the  financial  institution, 

must  the fact that it was presented against insufficient  funds  still be reported? 

nswer:    Yes.  It  is  improper  for  an  attorney  to  have  “overdraft  privileges”  or  any  other 
arrangement  for  a  personal  loan  to  cover  a  trust  or  client’s  account.    Therefore,  all 
such  instruments  presented  against  insufficient  funds  must  be  reported.  Overdraft 
privileges,  however,  for  an attorney  business  account  are permissible.

uestion:  Is  there  some  type  of  pre-approved  report  form  to  be  sent  to  the  Disciplinary 

Board  concerning  overdrafts? 

nswer:    Where  instruments  are  dishonored,  a  copy  of  the  notice  of  dishonor  customarily  sent 
to  the  depositor  is  enough.    Where  instruments  are  presented  against  insufficient 
funds  but  are  paid  by  financial  institutions  then  the  rule  sets  out  a  list  of  specific  items 
to be furnished  to the  Disciplinary  Board. 

uestion:  What  is classified as a financial  institution? 

nswer:    All  banks  (national,  federal,  or  state),  trust  companies,  loan  and  investment  banks, 
credit  unions,  and  any  other  financial  institutions  where  an  attorney  maintains  trust 
accounts. 

 

 

Question:  Does the rule require  notice of instruments  presented against uncollected  funds? 

nswer:    No.    The  rule  does  not  address  the  “collectability  of  funds”  but  only  requires 
reporting  where  a  check  is  presented  against  “insufficient  funds.”  Members  of  the  bar 
are  reminded,  however,  that  drawing  on  any  funds  that  have  been  deposited  in  a  trust 
account  or  any  other  account  exposes  the  attorney  to  financial  risks  if  for  any  reason 
the  “uncollected  item”  does not  clear. 

Question:  Is  the  provision  in  the  rule  requiring  attorney  trust  accounts  to  be  maintained  in 

Rhode Island  new? 

nswer:    No.  Rhode  Island  Disciplinary  Rule  9-102  has  contained  this  requirement  since  1975. 
The  requirement  is  also  under  Rule  1.15 of  the Rules  of Professional  Conduct. 

uestion:  Must 

instruments  be 

reported  which  are 

returned  unpaid  due 

to 

nswer:    No.    Only  properly  payable  instruments  which  are  returned  for  insufficient  funds  need 

incompleteness? 

be reported. 

uestion:  Since  all  attorney  trust  accounts  are  required  by  Article  IV,  Rule  2  be  clearly 
identified  as  “trust,”  “client,”  or  “escrow  accounts”  and  since  instruments 
presented  against  insufficient  funds  on  these  accounts  form  the  basis  for  the 
overdraft  notification  obligations  on  the  part  of  financial  institutions  to  the 
Disciplinary  Board,  should  financial  institutions  uniformly  require  all  attorneys

and  law  firms  who  open  trust  accounts  to  include  the  designation  “Attorney 
Trust  Account?” 

nswer:    Article  IV,  Rule  2  allows  flexibility 

in  designating 

trust  or  clients’  accounts.  
Reference  to  “trust  accounts”  in  this  rule  is  for  the  collective  purpose  of  making 
general  reference  to  all  such  accounts  however  identified  but  does  not  require  that  all 
accounts  be  so  designated.    Since  the  account  designation  is  a  requirement  under  the 
Supreme  Court  rule  which  further  states  that  all  attorneys  are  conclusively  deemed  to 
have  consented  to  the  provisions,  all  attorney  trust  accounts  must  be  so  designated 
when  opened  and  financial  institutions  should  insist  upon  this  in  all  cases.  Many 
attorney  “trust  accounts”  have  been  opened  under  the  designation  of  “client  account” 
or “escrow  account.”   Those  are also  permissible  designations. 

uestion:  Is  executor,  guardian,  trustee,  receiver,  or  any  other  similar  fiduciary  account 

included  within  Article  IV, Rule 2? 

nswer:    Fiduciary  accounts  are  excepted  from 

the  definition  “attorney  trust  account”  in 
Article  IV,  Rule  2  and  you  are  not  required  to  report  overdrafts  drawn  on  these 
accounts.

   (1)(a)  Lawyers  and  law  firms  who  practice  law  in  this  state  shall  deposit  all  funds  held  in  trust 
in  accordance  with  Rule  1.15  of  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  (Article  V  of  the  Supreme 
Court  Rules)  in  accounts  clearly  identified  as  “trust,”  “client”  or  “escrow”  accounts,  collectively 
referred  to  herein  as  “trust  accounts,”  and  shall  take  all  steps  necessary  to  inform  the  depository 
institution  in  which  the  trust  accounts  are  deposited  of  the  purpose  and  identity  of  such  accounts. 
For  the  purposes  of  this  Rule  2,  trust  accounts  shall  not  include  funds  held  by  a  lawyer  as  trustee 
under  an  inter  vivos  or  testamentary  trust,  guardian,  executor,  receiver  or  similar  fiduciary 
capacity.  Trust  accounts  shall  be  maintained  only  in  financial  institutions  approved  by  this  Court 
or  this  Court's  Disciplinary  Board.  The  names  of  financial  institutions  in  which  such  trust 
accounts  are  maintained  and  identification  numbers  of  each  such  account  shall  be  recorded  on 
the  annual  lawyer  registration  form  filed  with  this  Court.  Trust  accounts,  and  the  maintenance 
thereof,  shall  be subject  to the  following  additional  provisions.   

   (b)  A  financial  institution  shall  be  approved  as  a  depository  for  trust  accounts  if  it  shall  file 
with  this  Court  or  this  Court's  Disciplinary  Board  an  agreement,  in  a  form  provided  by  the  Court 
or  Disciplinary  Board,  to  report  to  the  Disciplinary  Board  in  the  event  any  properly  payable 
is  presented  against  a  trust  account  containing  insufficient  funds,  irrespective  of 
instrument 
is  honored.  This  Court  or  Disciplinary  Board  shall  establish  rules 
whether

governing  approval  and 
institutions,  and  shall 
termination  of  approved  status  for  financial 
annually  publish  a  list  of  approved  financial  institutions.  No  trust  account  shall  be  maintained  in 
any  financial  institution  which  does  not  agree  to  make  such  reports.  Any  such  agreement  shall 
apply  to  all  branches  of  the  financial  institution  and  shall  not  be  cancelled  except  upon  thirty  (30) 
day’s  notice  in  writing  to this  Court  or Disciplinary  Board.

   (c)  The  overdraft  notification  agreement  shall  provide  that  all  reports  made  by  financial 
institutions  shall  be in  the  following  format:

that  are  presented  against  insufficient  funds  but  which 
instruments  are  honored,  the  report  shall  be  in  similar  form  as  in  the  case  of  a  dishonored 
instrument  and  shall  also  include  the  date  of  presentation  of  the  instrument  for  payment,  as  well 
as the  amount  of the  overdraft  created  thereby.   

instruments 

   Such  reports  shall  be  made  simultaneously  with,  and  within  the  time  provided  by  law  for 
notice  of  dishonor,  if  any,  to  depositors.  If  an  instrument  presented  against  insufficient  funds  is 
honored,  then  the  report  shall  be  made  within  five  (5)  banking  days  of  the  date  of  presentation 
for  payment  against  insufficient  funds.   

   (d)  Every  lawyer  or  law  firm  practicing  or  admitted  to  practice  in  this  state  shall,  as  a 
condition  thereof,  release  a  participating  financial  institution  from  any  cause  of  action  resulting 
from  a  report  provided  to  the  Court  or  the  Court's  Disciplinary  Board  and  be  conclusively 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

Rule 2. Trust  account  overdraft  notification.   

deemed  to  have  consented  to  the  reporting  and  production  requirements  by  financial  institutions 
mandated  by this  rule. 

    (e)  Nothing  herein  shall  preclude  a  financial  institution  from  charging  a  lawyer  or  law  firm  for 
the  reasonable  cost of producing  the  reports and records required  by this  rule.   

ule 1.15. Safekeeping property. 

  R

  
(a)  A  lawyer  shall  hold  property  of  clients  or  third  persons  that  is  in  a  lawyer's  possession  in 
connection  with  a  representation  separate  from  the  lawyer's  own  property.  Funds  shall  be  kept  in 
a  separate  account  maintained  in  the  state  where  the  lawyer's  office  is  situated,  or  elsewhere  with 
the  consent  of  the  client  or  third  person.  Other  property  shall  be  identified  as  such  and 
appropriately  safeguarded.  Complete  records  of  such  account  funds  and  other  property  shall  be 
kept  by  the  lawyer  and  shall  be  preserved  for  a  period  of  seven  years  after  termination  of  the 
representation.   

 
(b)  A  lawyer  may  deposit  the  lawyer's  own  funds  in  a  client  trust  account  for  the  sole 
purpose  of  paying  bank  service  charges  on  that  account,  but  only  in  an  amount  necessary  for  that 
purpose.   

 (c)  A  lawyer  shall  deposit  into  a  client  trust  account  legal  fees  and  expenses  that  have  been 

 
paid  in  advance,  to be withdrawn  by the  lawyer  only  as fees  are earned or expenses  incurred.   

 
(d)  Upon  receiving  funds  or  other  property  in  which  a  client  or  third  person  has  an  interest,  a 
lawyer  shall  promptly  notify  the  client  or  third  person.  Except  as  stated  in  this  rule  or  otherwise 
permitted  by  law  or  by  agreement  with  the  client,  a  lawyer  shall  promptly  deliver  to  the  client  or 
third  person  any  funds  or  other  property  that  the  client  or  third  person  is  entitled  to  receive  and, 
upon  request  by  the  client  or  third  person,  shall  promptly  render  a  full  accounting  regarding  such 
property.   

 
(e)  When  in  the  course  of  representation  a  lawyer  is  in  possession  of  property  in  which  two 
or  more  persons  (one  of  whom  may  be  the  lawyer)  claim  interests,  the  property  shall  be  kept 
separate  by  the  lawyer  until  the  dispute  is  resolved.  The  lawyer  shall  promptly  distribute  all 
portions  of  the property  as to which  the interests  are not in  dispute. 

  
(f)   A  lawyer  or  law  firm  shall  deposit  clients'  funds,  which  are  nominal  in  amount  or  to  be 
held  for  a  short  period  of  time,  in  one  or  more  interest  bearing  trust  accounts  in  accordance  with 
the  following  provisions.  For  purposes  of  this  rule,  such  accounts  are  referred  to  as  Interest  on 
Lawyers'  Trust  Accounts  (IOLTA):   

  

   

 

 

(1) Earnings  from  such  IOLTA  accounts  shall  not  be available  to a lawyer  or law  firm. 

(2)  Whether  clients'  funds  are  nominal  in  amount  or  to  be  held  for  a  short  period  of  time 

shall  be determined  solely  by each attorney  or law  firm.   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

  

  

(3)  Notification  to  clients  whose  funds  are  deposited  in  IOLTA  accounts  shall  not  be 

necessary.   

   

 

(4)  Such  IOLTA  accounts  may  be  established  with  any  financial  institution  authorized  by 
federal  or  state  law  to  do  business  in  Rhode  Island,  the  deposits  in  which  are  insured 
by  insurance  entities  regulated  by  the  United  States  and/or  the  State  of  Rhode  Island 
or  any  agency  or  instrumentality  thereof.  Funds  deposited  in  such  accounts  shall  be 
available  for withdrawal  immediately  upon  demand.   

 

(5)  The  rate  of  interest  payable  on  any  IOLTA  account  shall  not  be  less  than  the  highest 
interest  rate  or  dividend  available  from  the  financial  institution  to  its  non-IOLTA 
customers  when  the  IOLTA  account  meets  the  same  minimum  balance  or  other 
eligibility  qualifications.  Lawyers  or  law  firms  making  such  deposits  shall  direct  the 
depository  institution: 

   

 

   

 

 

 

(i)  To  remit  interest  or  dividends  on  such  deposits,  net  of  any  service  or  fees,  at  least 
quarterly,  to  the  Rhode  Island  Bar  Foundation  (the  "Foundation").  Revised  June 
2017    

(ii)  To  transmit  to  the  Foundation  and  the  depositor  with  each  remittance  statements

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
