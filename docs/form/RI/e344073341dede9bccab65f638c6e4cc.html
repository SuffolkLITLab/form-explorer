      <pre>F YOU FAIL TO APPEAR IN COURT 
1.  A judicial officer may enter a default judgment for the fine, fees, costs, 

and/or assessments.

fine, fees, costs, and assessments, as applicable. 

3.  Your license may be suspended or revoked.   
4.  Your registration may be suspended or revoked. 

OOD DRIVING RECORD 
 
If you have a good driving record you may request that your summons be 
dismissed  upon  payment  of  fees,  costs,  and/or  assessments.  You  must 
appear in court to request this procedure. “Good driving record” means no 
moving violations within the three (3)*  years prior to the current violation. 
(*Certain  restrictions  apply.  Refer 
to  G.L.  1956  §  31.41.1-7  or 
www.courts.ri.gov for complete details. Commercial driver’s license (CDL) 
holders cannot seek dismissal under this statute.) 
  If you are an out-of-state motorist, you must bring a certified copy of 
your driving record to your first appearance.   
PAYMENT - FINES, FEES, COSTS, AND/OR ASSESSMENTS 
  Fines,  fees,  costs,  and/or  assessments  must  be  paid  immediately 
following the court hearing. Acceptable forms of payment are as follows: 
For Traffic Tribunal summonses, credit card paid online on the Rhode Island 
Judiciary’s website at  www.courts.ri.gov or in person; cash paid in person; 
check,  money order, or certified cashier’s check payable to the court listed 
on  summons.  Do  not  mail  cash,  include  summons,  and  write  your 
summons number on your check.   
    A  failure  to  pay  fines,  fees,  costs,  and/or  assessments  may  result  in  a 
suspension  or  revocation  of  your  driver's  license  and/or  your  automobile 
registration, withholding of state income tax refunds, and/or the publishing 
of  your  name  and  amount  due  on  the  Rhode  Island  Judiciary’s  website  at 
www.courts.ri.gov if unpaid for over ninety (90) days. 
  If this is a MUNICIPAL COURT summons contact that court 
for their payment policy. 

 

PPEALS PROCEDURE 

  You  have  a  right  to  appeal  any  judgment  of  the  Traffic  Tribunal  or 
Municipal Court to the Appeals Panel of the Traffic Tribunal. 
  You must file a Notice of Appeal within ten (10) days of the imposition of 
sentence or judgment. The most current fee information is on the Notice of 
Appeal form.  All appeals will follow the rules and procedures provided by 
law.  
       The Appeals Panel will review the record to determine if the judgment 
which  entered  is  in  accordance  with  law.  There  will  not  be  a  new  trial  or 
evidentiary  hearing  unless  remanded  back  to  the  trial  court  for  further 
hearing.

UNICIPAL COURTS 

  M

   

 
YOU  HAVE  BEEN  CHARGED  WITH  A  CIVIL 
VIOLATION 
  Your  civil  violation  will  be  heard  in  either  the  Traffic  Tribunal  or  a 
 
Municipal Court. 
  The  summons  is  a  legal  document  charging  you  with  a  violation  and 
orders your appearance for the hearing.  It states the offense, the time, and 
place when you should appear. 

HAT SHOULD YOU DO? 
1.   Read the summons carefully. 
2.   Consider your options: 

If eligible, you may pay the summons by Internet, by mail, or in person. 
(If  a  Municipal  Court  summons,  contact  that  court  for  payment 
information.) 

 

Or 

You may appear in court at a hearing. Corporate defendants see Traffic 
Trib. R. P. 23(c) regarding court appearances. 
    You may wish to consult with an attorney of your choice at your own cost. 
 

MANDATORY COURT APPEARANCES 
  Under  G.L.  1956  §  31-41.1-3.1,  “any  person  who  receives  a  third 
(3rd)  summons  after  two  (2)  guilty  adjudications  for  traffic  offenses 
within twelve-month (12) period of time cannot plea or dispose of the 
charge by mail, but must appear in person before a judge at the traffic 
tribunal  or  municipal  court.  All  parking 
ticket  summons  or 
adjudications shall be exempt  from this section.” If  you have had two 
(2) guilty adjudications (excluding parking tickets) within a twelve (12) 
month period, you must appear for court and are not eligible to pay the 
summons by mail. 

DMINISTRATIVE PAYMENTS 
 
If  you are eligible to pay this summons  without a court appearance 
all payments must be received by the court not later than seven (7) 
days before the court hearing date or a fine, fees, costs, assessments, 
and/or other sanctions may be assessed.  If a hearing is required or you 
wish to contest this violation, appear in court on the date cited. Include 
a copy of your summons and write the complete summons number 
on your check and all correspondence. 

IRST APPEARANCE 
 
If a hearing is required or you wish to appear for a hearing there will 
be  a  first  appearance.  At  the  first  appearance,  you  may  admit  the 
charge(s) or request a full trial where evidence will be presented. 
 
If you admit to the violation, a judgment will enter with a fine, fees, 
costs,  and/or  assessments.  The  judicial  officer  may  also  impose 
additional sanctions as allowed by law, including license or registration 
suspension or revocation. Full payment will be required at that time. 
 
If you plead not guilty to the violation the matter will be continued 
to a date certain for trial. You will receive a notice with the new court 
date for your trial. 
  On  the  trial  date  all  witnesses  should  be  present.  The  state  or  the 
municipality  has  the  burden  of  proving  the  offense  by  clear  and 
convincing  evidence.  If,  after  trial  you  are  found not to  have  violated 
the law, the  matter  will be dismissed;  no money  will be paid and you 
will have no record of a civil violation.  If  you  are  found  guilty  of  the 
violation, a judgment enters and you will be ordered to pay a fine, fees, 
costs, and/or assessments and to comply with any additional sanctions 
imposed,  which  may  include  license  or  registration  suspension  or 
revocation.  

OUT-OF-STATE MOTORISTS 
  If  you  are  an  out-of-state  motorist,  you  must  bring  a  certified 
copy of your driving record to your first appearance.  It should be 
requested from your state’s registry at least thirty (30) days before 
your court date.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
