Tribe. , or agency . informs the court that the child is an Indian child; any agency involved in child protection services . or family support has discovered information suggesting that the child is an Indian child; the child . gives the court reason to believe he or she is an Indian child; the residence of the child, parent (s) , . or custodian is known to be on a reservation or a predominantly Indian community; a parent of the . child is enrolled in a .

Where an agency is involved in the . . child. -custody proceeding, active efforts must involve assisting the parent or parents or Indian . custodian through the steps of a case plan and with accessing or developing the resources necessary . . to satisfy the case plan. To the maximum extent possible, active efforts should be provided in a . manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the Indian . child's Tribe and should be conducted in partnership with the Indian child and the Indian child. 's . parents, extended family members, Indian custodians, and Tribe. Active efforts are to be tailored . to the facts and circumstances of the case. 25 C. F. R. 23. 2 .

S. A. 38-. 2279, that the withholding order may be served . on the parent™s employer without further notice, and the child support order may be enforced by . . any method allowed by law. K. S. A. 38. -2256 provides that a child support order that has been . registered under K. S. A. 38 2279 may only be modified pursuant to that statute. . The court may enter a restraining order (Form 134) against any alleged perpetrator of . physical, sexual, mental or emotional abuse of the child. . This form includes . a provision . allowing . for issuance of a. restraining order pursuant to K. S. A. 38. -2255 (d) (4) . . Rev. 08. /20. 21 . ©KSJC. 12 Custody and . Placeme. nt . If the court awards custody of the child to the secretary then the secretary shall have t. he . authority to place the child; . however, in future hearings, the court will be required to make rulings . to find that the secretary has complied with the ICWA pla. cement preferences. BIA Guidelines for . Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act, December 2016, Section C. 6. . If the court awards . custody to the secretary, then the court shall provide the secretary with. a copy of any orders . entered. . . To the extent possi. ble, the Court must document where the child is or will be placed. The . Court must consider each category of preferred placement individually in descending order. . Starting with the first preferred placement category (a member of the child™s extended family) . , if . the child is not in that category of preferred placement, the Court must make specific findings . . explaining why the child is not placed within that category of preferred placement before moving . to the next category of preferred placement. For example, . if a child is placed in an Indian foster . home that is licensed by a non Indian licensing authority (. placement category . #3) , the court must . first make finding explaining why the child is not placed with a member of the child™s extended . . family (. placement cat. egory . #1) . Then, the court must make findings explaining why the child is . not placed in a foster home that is licensed by the child™s . Tribe. (. placement category . #2) . . An Indian child must be placed in the least. -restrictive setting that: (1) most approximates . a family, taking into consideration sibling attachment; (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs . . (if any) to be met; and (3) is in reasonable proximity to the In. dian child™s home, extended family, . or siblings. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . Unless the child™s . Tribe. has established a different order of . preference, preference to placement of the child with the following people must be given, in . descending order as listed belo. w: (1) A member of the Indian child™s extended family; . (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child™s Tribe; . (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non. -Indian licensing . authority; or . (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian . organization which has a program suitable to meet the child™s needs. 25 U. S. C. 1915; . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (b) . . The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indi. an child or the Indian . child™s parent. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (d) . . . If a party argues there is good cause to deviate from the placement preferences, the court . must. allow for all parties to provide evidence and make arguments to the court regarding whether . there . is good cause to deviate. The court must. make finding. s . on the record or in writing about . whether the party seeking the departure from the placement preferences has proven this through . clear and convincing evidence. 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (b) . The court™s finding of good cause should be . based on one or more of the following considerations: . (1) The request of one or both of the Indian child™s parents, if they attest that they have . reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference; . (2. ) The request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the . decision that is being made; . (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular . Rev. 08. /20. 21 . ©KSJC. 13 placement; . (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as . specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the comm. unity where families . who meet the placement preferences live; and/or. (5) The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a . diligent search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference . criteria, but no. ne have been located. The standard for determining whether a placement . is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian . community in which the Indian child™s parent or extended family resides or with which . the paren. ts or extended family maintains social and cultural ties. 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (c) . . A placement may not depart from the preferences based on socioeconomic statutes of any . placement relative to another placement; or based solely on ordinary bonding or attachme. nt that . flowed from time spent in a non. -preferred placement that was made in violation of ICWA. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (d) and (e) . . The court should make detailed findings as to whether the agency has . made an ongoing, diligent search to locate extended family, a tribal member, or other Indian family . . for placement if the child is not already with a preferred placement pursuant to 25 U. S. C. 1915 (b) ; . 25 C. F. R. 23. 130 and 23. 131. . Clarity and Translation . . The court should write the order in easily understandable lang. uage that allows the parent (s) . or Indian custodian to fully understand what action they must take to have the child returned to . . their care. An interpreter should be provided for a parent or Indian custodian whose first language . is not English. Compliance w. ith ICWA is jurisdictional. Failure to comply with ICWA may render . orders devoid of authority. </div>
