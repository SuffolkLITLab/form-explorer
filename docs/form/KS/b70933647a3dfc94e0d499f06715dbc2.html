K. S. A. 38. -2264 (f) . . K. S. A. 38. -2286 specifies . requirements concerning grandparents as potential custodians . which. must b. e stated on the record. . If the court does not award custody of the child to a parent . and, if a grandparent requests custody, the court shall give substantial consideration when . evaluating what custody, visitation or residency arrangements are in the best i. nterests of the . child. Relevant factors to be considered include wishes of the parents, child and grandparent; the . extent to which the grandparent has cared for, nurtured and supported the child; the intent and . circumstances under which the child is place. d with the grandparent, including whether domestic . violence is a factor and whether the child is placed to allow the parent to seek work or attend . school; and the physical and mental health of all individuals involved. . If the child is placed in a quali. fied residential treatment program (QRTP) at the time of . the perman. ency hearing, the court must mak. e specialized findings. The court must first . determine whether the ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child does or does . not support the de. . . foster home, then the court must determine: whether that placement in a qualifie. d residential . treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the . least restrictive environment, and whether the placement is consistent with the short. -term and . long term goals for the child, as specified in the. permanency plan for the child. The court must . also make specific findings of fact regarding: the specific treatment or service needs that will be . met for the child in the QRTP placement; the length of time the child is expected to need the . 07/2019 ©KSJC 7 treatment or se. rvices; and the efforts made by the secretary to prepare the child to return home or . to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster . family home. . The court, based on citizen review board recommendatio. ns, shall determine whether the . child will be reintegrated with a parent, placed for adoption, placed with a permanent custodian, . or placed in another planned permanent living arrangemen. t. As set out in the form, the court . shall ma. ke reasonable efforts fin. dings. . Upon finding that reintegration continues to be a viable . goal. , the court may rescind prior dispositional orders and enter any dispositional order authorized . by the code, or order that a new r. eintegration plan be prepared. . Upon finding that reintegra. tion is . no longer a viable . goal. , the court shall make the considerations and. findings set out in the form. . If reintegration is not a viable alternative and either adoption or appointment of a permanent . custodian might be in the best interests of the child, . then the county or district attorney shall file . a motion to terminate parental rights or a motion to appoint a permanent custodian within 30 . days, and the court shall set a hearing on such motion within 90 days of the filing of the motion. </div>
