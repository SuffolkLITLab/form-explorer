Form 10. 7 must be used. . Failure to make and properly document the . findings required by . the Adoption and Safe Families Act (. ASFA. ) . in the initial order authorizing . out of home placement will result in the loss of federal funding for the child . throughout . the present . case. . When a court has reason to know a child involved in a child in need of care proceeding is . an Indian child, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) applies; notice requirements, findings and . . procedure are dictated by ICWA, and . the ICWA forms must be used. . If ICWA applies, use form . 216. 1 instead of this form. . In addition to the federal ICWA statutes, all federal regulatio. ns (25 . C. F. R. 23) must be followed. The court should also consult the BIA December 2016 guidelines. (www. bia. gov/bia/ois/dhs/icwa) . . The court must ask each participant in the case whether the participant knows or has reason . to know that the child is an Indian child. The inquiry and all responses should be on the record. . The term ﬁparticipantﬂ is used in the regulations and is meant to be very broad. The goal is to . encourage anyone, not just parties, to provide information to the court. The court must also . instruct . the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason to . know the child is an Indian child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 107 (a) . . If there is reason to know the child is an . Indian child but the court does not have sufficient. evidence to determine that the child is or . is not an Indian child, the court must treat the child as an Indian child, unless and until it is . . determined on the record that the child does not meet the definition of an Indian child. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 107 (b) . . The . court ﬁhas reason to knowﬂ a child is an Indian child if: . ﬁ (1) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the . proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the . . court that the child is an Indian child; . (2) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved . in the. proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the. . court that it has discovered information indicating that the child is an. Indian child; . (3) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to. know he or she i. s an Indian child; . Rev. 08/. 2021 ©KSJC. 7 (4) The court is informed that the domicile or residence of the child, the. child™s parents, or the child™s Indian custodian is on a reservation or in. an Alaska Native village; . (5) The court is informed that the child is or has been a war. d of a Tribal. court; or. (6) The court is informed that either parent or the child possesses an. identification card indicating membership in an Indian Tribe. ﬂ 25 C. F. R. . . 23. 107 (c) . . Adjudication hearings are now open to the public, unless the court determin. es that closed . proceedings, or the exclusion of a specific person, are in the best interests of the child or are . necessary to protect the privacy rights of the parents. . The court may exclude the public during the . presentation of evidence that is confidenti. al (see K. S. A. 38. -2209) or conduct an . in camera. inspection. . The court may not exclude the guardian . ad litem. , parties or interested parties. . Dispositional hearings shall be closed except the parties, the guardian . ad litem. , interested parties, . officers of th. e court, CASA and the custodian may attend. . Other persons may be permitted to . attend by consent of the parties or order of the court, if the court determines that their attendance . . would be in the best interests of the child or the conduct of the proceeding. s. The court may impose . limitations as appropriate. . In addition, the court shall permit the attendance of up to two people . who have been designated by the parent as allies, if they have participated in a parent ally . . orientation program approved by the judi. cial administrator. . An ally may be removed if the ally . becomes disruptive or has been disruptive in a prior proceeding. . K. S. A. 38. -2247. . Once a case is filed, . K. S. A. 38. -2251 (c) requires . that . an adjudicatory hearing shall be held . without undue delay, and w. ithin 60 days from the date the child was removed from the home, if . applicable. . The standard of proof in an adjudication hearing is clear and convincing. . K. S. A. 38-. 2251 provides that if the court does not find by clear and convincing evidence, pursuant to K. S. A. . 38 2250, that the child is a child in need of care, then the court shall dismiss the proceedings. . This . form provides for dismissal as to some parties and adjudication as to others. . The court may proceed to disposition at the same hearing, if notice requirements have been . met. . K. S. A. 38-. 2254 requires notice of the dispositional hearing be given to the parties and the . following: foster parents or permanent custodian, preadoptive parents, the person who has custody . . of the child, any person with close emotional ties to the child who has requested notice and is . . deemed by the court to be essential to the deliberations, the grandparents or the closest relative of . the child™s parent if a grandparent is not living or the address is not known. . Notice shall be given . by first class mail no less than 10 business days before the hearing. . K. S. A. 38 2255 (a) sets out the considerations that the court must make prior to entering a . dispositional order. . In addition to entering a custody order, the court may impose terms and . conditions which may include participation by the parent and child in programs and treatment for . the child. . The dispositional hearing may serve as a permanency hearing, if the requirements of . K. S. A. 38. -2265 have been met. . Those require. ments are notice requirements. . Rev. 08/. 2021 ©KSJC. 8 If the court makes the required findings . set out in Form 107 . and removes the child from a . parent™s custody, the court may award custody of the child to a relative, to a person with whom . the child has close emotional ties, t. o any other suitable person, to a shelter facility, to a youth . residential facility or to the secretary. . If this is the first order relieving a parent of custody and . authorizing out of home placement. or the first order of removal when the child has been ho. me . for six months or longer (as in an informal supervision) , . Form 107 must be used. . . If a grandparent requests custody, the form facilitates documentation required by . K. S. A. . 38 2286. , which specified requirem. ents concerning grandparents as potential custo. dians. . If the . court does not award custody of the child to a parent and, if a grandparent requests custody, the . . court shall give substantial consideration when evaluating what custody, visitation or residency . arrangements are in the best interests of the c. hild. . Relevant factors to be considered include wishes . of the parents, child and grandparent; the extent to which the grandparent has . cared for. , nurtured . and supported the. child; . the intent and circumstances under which the child is placed with the . grandpa. rent, including whether domestic violence is a factor and whether the child is placed to . allow the parent to seek work or attend school; and the physical and mental health of all individuals . . involved. . If the court awards custody of the child to the secre. tary. , K. S. A. 38. -2255 (d) (1) provides . the . secretary shall have the authority to place the child, and the court may make placement . recommendations. . The court shall provide the secretary with a copy of any orders entered. . The . court may determine, after . notice and hearing, that the secretary™s placement is contrary to the . welfare or best interests of the child, considering the health and safety needs of the child and the . resources available. . If the court determines that the placement is contrary to the we. lfare or not in . the best interests of the child, the court shall notify the secretary, who shall then make an alternative . placement. . The court may enter an order for one or both parents to pay child support, and shall enter a . child support order if the s. ecretary is granted custody of the child. . The court shall issue an income . withholding order, regardless of whether a payor/employer has been identified. . The parent shall . be given notice that the order may be registered pursuant to K. S. A. 38-. 2279, that the . withholding . order may be served on the parent™s employer without further notice, and the child support order . . may be enforced by any method allowed by law. . K. S. A. 38. -2256 provides that a child support . order that has been registered under K. S. A. 38. -2279 may . only be modified pursuant to that statute. . If the court awards custody of the child to a person other than a parent, the custodian shall . notify the court in writing at least 10 days prior to any planned placement with a parent, stating . . the basis for the custodian™s belief that placement with a parent is no longer contrary to the welfare . of the child. . The court may set the proposed placement with a parent for hearing to determine if . the child should be allowed to return home. . If the matter is set for heari. ng, the custodian shall not . return the child home without the written consent of the court (Form 165) . K. S. A. 38 2255 (d) (2) . . The court may enter a restraining order (Form 134) against any alleged perpetrator of . physical, sexual, mental or emotional abuse of the c. hild. . This form includes a provision allowing . for issuance of a restraining order pursuant to K. S. A. 38 2255 (d) (4) . . Rev. 08/. 2021 ©KSJC. 9 In the statutory definition of ﬁchild in need of care, ﬂ K. S. A. . 38 2202 (d) (6) . references . K. S. A. 72 977 and 72 1111; however, in 2017 the contents of K. S. A. 72 977 and 72-. 1111 were . transferred to K. S. A. . 72-. 3421 and 72. -3120 . respectively. While the definition . in K. S. A. . 38-. 2202 (d) (6) . still includes incorrect statutory references, to provide clarity this form has been . updated to include correct statutory references. . When the term ﬁorﬂ stands alone between optional findings/orders, more than one choice . may be checked. . Each choice checked must be justified as instructed, e. g. . specify basis for finding. . </div>
