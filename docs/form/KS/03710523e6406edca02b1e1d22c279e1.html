Rule 174 (b) . Failure to make and properly document the findings required by ASFA will result . . in the loss of federal funding. . Federal funding is not available when the court finds reasonable . efforts have not been m. ade. . The loss of federal funding continues until the court finds reasonable . efforts have been made and the court™s findings are properly documented. . .

Failure to . make and properly document the findings required by ASFA in the initial order authorizing out. -of-. home placement will result in the loss of federal funding for the placement, or any subsequent . placement, of the child in the present case. . Timing of permanency hearing. . A permanency hearing shall be held within 12 months of. the date the child entered ou. t-. of-. home placement, and at least every 12 months thereafter. .

A sample report . form may be obtained. on the Kansas Judicial Council website or. through the Office of Judicial . Administration. . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 9 Identifying the Tribe (s) . . The. court must determine whether the child™s Tribe has been identified and whether the . Tribe has been afforded a full opportunity to participate in the proceedings. If so, the court must . . determine whether the agency provided the child™s Tribe with copies of the petition, reports, and . . information concerning the child in a timely manner. 25 U. S. C. 1911 (c) & (d) ; 25 U. S. C. . . 1912 (a) . . . Continued placement outside the home. . The court shall make findings as to why the child is in need of either continued placement . . outside the parent™s home or continued supervision, articulating the clear and convincing . . evidence that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian would likely result . . in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. 25 U. S. C. 1912 (e) . The evidence must . . show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the home and the likehood that . . continued custody of the child will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the . . particular child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 121 (c) . Without the causal relationship, evidence that shows only . . the existence of community or family poverty, single parenthood, custodian age, crowded or . . inadequate house, substance abuse, or nonconforming social behavior does not by itself . . constitute clear and convincin. g evidnece that continued custody is likely to result in serious . emotional or physical damage to the child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 121 (d) . . . Reasonable and Active Efforts Findings. . The Court must decide whether the appropriate public or private agencies have made . (1) . reasonable efforts . and (2) active efforts to assist and support the family to accomplish the current . permanency goal (s) . Federal funding is tied to whether the agency is providing reasonable . . effor. ts. ICWA requires the agency to provide active efforts. The Court may decide that the . . efforts provided were reasonable and active, reasonable but not active, or neither reasonable nor . . active. . ﬁActive efforts. ﬂ . means affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts intended . primarily to maintain or reunite an . Indian child with his or her family. Where an agency is . involved in the child. -custody proceeding, active efforts must involve assisting the parent or . parents or Indian custodian through the steps of a. case plan and with accessing or developing the . resource. s necessary to satisfy the case plan. To the maximum extent possible, active efforts . should be provided in a manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural conditions and . . way of life of the. Indian child's Tribe and should be conducted in partnership with the Indian . child and the Indian child's parents, extended family members, Indian custodians, and Tribe. . . Active efforts are to be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the case. . 25 C. F. R. 23. 2. . The . court shall make . detailed . findings . about whe. ther reasonable and active efforts have been . provided to assist the family, what the active efforts were, and whether the efforts have been . . sucessful. . . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 10 If the court finds that (1) appropriate public . or private agencies have not made reasonable . efforts to . assist and support the family to accomplish the current permanency goal (s) set out in . . the permanency plan. , (2) the reasonable and prudent parenting standard has not been met, or (3) . the child does not have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally . . appropriate activities, then the court will hold another permanency hearing no later than 60 days . . following the finding. K. S. A. 38 2264 (f) . . Preferred Placement. The Court must document where the child is placed. . An Indian child must be pl. aced in . the least. -restrictive setting that: (1) most approximates a family, taking into consideration sibling . attachment; (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs (if any) to be met; and (3) is in . reasonable . . proximity to the Indian child™s home, extended family, or siblings. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . Unless . . the child™s . Tribe. has established a different order of preference, preference to placement of the . child with the following people must be given, in d. escending order as listed below: . (1) A member of the Indian child™s extended family; . . (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child™s Tribe; . . (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non. -Indian lice. nsing . authority; or . (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian . organization which has a program suitable to meet the child™s needs. 25 U. S. C. 1915; . . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (b) . . . The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indian child or the Indian . . child™s parent. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (d) . . . . Because the child™s placement in a qualified residential treatment program is unlikely . to . fall. within any of the ICWA or Tribe™s preferred placement categories, . this form assumes the . Court will make findings about whether there is good cause to deviate from the placement . . preferences. The Court must also make all the required findings about the QRTP placement. . . . If a party argues there is good cause to deviate from. the placement preferences, the court . must allow for all. parties to provide evidence and make arguments to the court regarding . whether there is good cause to deviate. The court must make finding. s . on the record or in writing . about whether the party seeking . the departure from the placement preferences has proven . this . . through clear and convincing evidence. 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (b) . . T. he court™s finding of good cause . should be based on one or more of the following considerations: . . . (1) The request of one or both of the Indian child™s parents, if they attest that they have. reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference; . (2) The request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the . decision that is bein. g made; . (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular . placement; . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 11 (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as . specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in. the community where . families who meet the placement preferences live; and/or. (5) The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a . diligent search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference . criteri. a, but none have been located. The standard for determining whether a . placement is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards . . of the Indian community in which the Indian child™s parent or extended family resides . . or with which . the parents or extended family maintains social and cult. ural ties. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (c) . . . A placement may not depart from the preferences based on socioeconomic statutes of any . placement relative to another placement; or based solely on ordinary bonding or. attachment that . flowed from time spent in a non. -preferr. ed placement that was made in violation of ICWA. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (d) and (e) . The court should make detailed findings as to whether the agency has . . made an ongoing, diligent search to locate extended family, a tribal member, or other Indian . . family for place. ment if the child is not already with a preferred placement pursuant to 25 U. S. C. . 1915 (b) ; 25 C. F. R. 23. 130 and 23. 131. . . . If the child is placed in a qualified residential treatment program (QRTP) at the time of . the permanency hearing, the court must make . specialized findings. The court must first . . determine whether the ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child does or does . . not support the determination that the child™s needs cannot be met through placement in a foster . . family home. If the co. urt determines that the child™s needs cannot be met through placement in a . foster home, then the court must determine: whether that placement in a qualified residential . . treatment program provides the . most effective and appropriate level of care for the chi. ld in the . least restrictive environment, and whether the placement is consistent with the short. -term and . long-. term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. The court mus. t also make specific findings of fact regarding: the spe. cific treatment or service needs that will be . . met for the child in the QRTP placement; the length of time the child is expected to need the . . treatment or services; and the efforts made by the secretary. to prepare the child to return home or . to be placed wit. h a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster . family home. . Permanency Goals . . The court, based on citizen review board recommendations, shall determine whether. the . child will be reintegrated with a parent, placed fo. r adoption, placed with a permanent custodian, . or placed in another planned permanent living arrangement. . Upon finding that reintegration . continues to be a viable. goal. , the court may rescind prior dispositional orders and enter any . dispositional order authorized by the code, or order that a new reintegration plan be prepared. . . Upon finding that reintegration is no longer a viable. goal. , the court shall make the considerations . and findings set out in the . form. . If reintegration is not a viable. goal. and either adoption or . appointment of a permanent custodian might be in the best interests of the child, then the county . . or district attorney shall file a motion to terminate parental rights or a motion to appoin. t a . permanent custodian within 30 days, and the court shall set a hearing on such motion within 90 . . days of the filing of the motion. . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 12 Clarity and Translation .

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
