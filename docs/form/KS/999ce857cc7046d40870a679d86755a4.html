If so, the court must determine whether the . . agency provided the child™s . Tribe. with copies of the petition, reports, and information concerning . the child in a timely manner. 25 U. S.

If the identity or location of the parents, Indian custodian, or Tribes cannot be ascertained, . but there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, notice of the proceeding must be sent to the . . appropriate BIA Regional Director. The BIA may be able to . help identify Tribes to contact. As . . much information as is known regarding the child™s direct lineal ancestors should be provided to . . the BIA. 25 C. F. R. 23. 111 (e) . After receipt of the notice, the BIA has 15 days to locate and notify . . the child™s Tribe and parents or Indian custodians. Within that 15 day period, if the BIA is unable . . to locate the parents or Indian custodians, or verify that the child meets the criteria of an Indian . . child, the BIA will inform the court and the state how much more time, if any, . will be needed to . complete the verification or the search. 25 C.

The same expert witness may be able . to testify to both issues, but sometimes multiple experts are needed. The expert witness cannot be . . the social worker regularly assigned to the child. 25 C. F. R. § 23. 122. . . Standard for termination of parental rights or appointment of permanent custodian. The court may terminate parental rights or appoint a permanent custodian when the child . has been adjudi. cated a child in need of care. . The standard, under K. S. A. 38. -2269 a, is clear and . convincing evidence that the parent is unfit by reason of conduct or condition which renders the . . parent unable to care properly for a child and the conduct or condition is unlikely to change in the . . foreseeable future. . However, ICWA raises the standard of proof to beyond a reasonable doubt. . . K. S. A. 38. -2269 sets out specific considerations that the court is required to make, in addition to . factors that may establish grounds for termination of parental rights. K. S. A. 38. -2271 defines the . terms and conditions under which the presumption of unfitness shifts the burden of proof to the . . parent. . . Prior to terminating the parental rights to an Indian child, the court must find that active . efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to . . prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that those efforts have proved unsuccessful. . ﬁActive . efforts. ﬂ . means affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts intended primarily to maintain or . Rev. 12/2018 ©KSJC . 12 reunite an Indian child with his or her family. Where an agency is involved in the child. -custody . proceeding, active efforts must involve assisting the parent or pare. nts or Indian custodian through . . the steps of a case plan and with accessing or developing the resources necessary to satisfy the case . . plan. To the maximum extent possible, active efforts should be provided in a manner consistent . . with the prevailing social . and cultural conditions and way of life of the Indian child's Tribe and . . should be conducted in partnership with the Indian child and the Indian child's parents, extended . . family members, Indian custodians, and Tribe. Active efforts are to be tailored to the. facts and . circumstances of the case. . 25 C. F. R. 23. 2. . T. he court shall make . detailed . findings . about whether . reasonable and active efforts have been provided to assist the family, what the active efforts were, . . and whether the efforts have been sucessful. . . . I. CWA prohibits termination of parental rights to an Indian child unless the court . determines beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian . . custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the c. hild. . 25 U. S. C. . 1912 (e) . The evidence must show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the . . home and the likehood that continued custody of the child will result in serious emotional or . . physical damage to the particular child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 121 (c) . Without the causal relationship, . . evidence that shows only the existence of community or family poverty, single parenthood, . . custodian age, crowded or inadequate house, substance abuse, or nonconforming social behavior . . does not by itself constitute clear and convincing evidnece that continued custody is likely to result . . in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 121 (d) . . . . K. S. A. 38. -2269 (g) requires that a court, after making a finding of unfitness, consider . whether termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the child, if requested, giving . . primary consideration to the physical, mental and. emotional health of the child. . If the court . terminates parental rights the court may authorize adoption, appointment of a permanent . . custodian, or continued permanency planning. . If the court does not terminate parental rights, the . court may authorize appointment of a permanent custodian or continued permanency planning, . . subject to ICWA. The placement preferences continue to be applicable. . Custody and . Placement. . After termination of parental rights, the court may enter an order granting custody of the . child to the secretary or a Kansas adoption corporation (authorized by K. S. A. 38. -112) for adoption . proceedings. The secretary or corporation shall have authority to place the child and give consent . . for the adoption of the child. . The court must make findings about how the foster. -car. e placement of . the child complies with or deviates from the list of foster. -care preferred placements. . . T. he court may grant custody of the child . directly to. the . proposed adoptive parents and . consent to the adoption. The court must make findings about how t. he adoptive placement complies . with or deviates from the list of adoptive preferred placements. The court™s jurisdiction over the . . child shall cease when an adoption decree is filed, and the court shall enter an order to that effect, . . Form 190. . . . The court may appoint a permanent custodian after making a finding of unfitness, whether . or not the parental rights are terminated. A permanent custodian may also be appointed by the . . consent of the parents. K. S. A. 38. -2272 provides that the secretary™s custody of the child shall . Rev. 12/2018 ©KSJC . 13 cease and the court may, but is not required to, terminate jurisdiction over the child upon . appointment of the permanent custodian. If an order terminating jurisdiction is not entered, the . . court may impose limitations or conditions upon the rights and responsibilities of the permanent . . custodian, some of which are set out in K. S. A. 38. -2272 (d) . Those shall be set out in the order of . appointment. . . . When custody has been granted for adoption, appointment of a permanent custodian or . continued permanency planning, the custodian shall submit a written plan for permanent . . placement of the child within 30 days. . . Placement Preferences. . The Court must document where the child is placed. . T. he Court must complete section A, . B, or C under the ﬁ. Adoptive . Placementﬂ. or ﬁFoster Care Placementﬂ. section. . The Court must . consider each category of preferred placement individually in descending order. Starting with the . . first preferred placement category (a member of the child™s extended family) , if the child is no. t in . that category of preferred placement, the Court must make specific findings explaining why the . . child is not placed within that category of preferred placement before moving to the next category . . of preferred placement. For example, if a child is placed. in an Indian foster home that is licensed . by a non. -Indian licensing authority (. placement category. #3) , the court must first make finding . explaining why the child is not placed with a member of the child™s extended family (. placement . category. #1) . Then, the. court must make findings explaining why the child is not placed in a foster . home that is licensed by the child™s . Tribe. (placement category. #2) . . An Indian child must be placed in the least. -restrictive setting that: (1) most approximates a . family, taking i. nto consideration sibling attachment; (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs (if . any) to be met; and (3) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child™s home, extended family, or . . siblings. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . Unless the child™s .

F. R. 23. 132 (c) . . .

C. F. R. 23. 132 (d) and (e) . The court should make detailed findings as to whether the agency has . . made an ongoing, diligent search to locate extended family, a . tribal member, or other Indian . . family for placement if the child is not already with a preferred placement pursuant to 25 U. S. C. . . 1915 (b) ; 25 C. F. R. 23. 130 and 23. 131. </div>
