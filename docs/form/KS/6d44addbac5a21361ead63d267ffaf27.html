Federal funding is not available . when the court finds reasonable efforts have not been made. . The loss of federal funding . continues until the court finds reasonable efforts have been made and the court™s findings are . . properly documented. . .

Form 20. 9 must be used. . Failure to . make and properly document the findings required by ASFA in the initial order authorizing out. -of-. home placement will result in the loss of federal funding for the placement, or any subsequent . placement, of the child in the present case. . . At the time of th. e permanency hearing, if the child is placed in a qualified residential . treatment program, Form 219. 7 must be used. . . Timing of permanency hearing. .

A sample report form may be . obtained . on the Kansas Judicial Council website or. through the Office of Judicial . Administration. . Rev. . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 10 Identifying the Tribe (s) . The court must determine whether the child™s Tribe has been identified and whether the . Tribe has been afforded a full opportunity to participate in the proceedings. If so, the court must . . determine whether the agency provided the child™s Tribe with copies of the petition, reports, and . . informati. on concerning the child in a timely manner. 25 U. S. C. 1911 (c) & (d) ; 25 U. S. C. . . 1912 (a) . . . Continued placement outside the home. . The court shall make findings as to why the child is in need of either continued placement . . outside the parent™s home or continued supervision, articulating the clear and convincing . . evidence that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian would likely result . . in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. 25 U. S. C. 1912 (e) . The evidence must . . show a causal. relationship between the particular conditions in the home and the likehood that . continued custody of the child will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the . . particular child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 121 (c) . Without the causal relationship, evidence that shows only . . the existence of community or family poverty, single parenthood, custodian age, crowded or . . inadequate house, substance abuse, or nonconforming social behavior does not by itself . . constitute clear and convincing evidnece that continued custody i. s likely to result in serious . emotional or physical damage to the child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 121 (d) . . . Reasonable and Active Efforts Findings. . The Court must decide whether the appropriate public or private agencies have made (1) . reasonable efforts . and (2) acti. ve efforts to assist and support the family to accomplish the current . permanency goal (s) . Federal funding is tied to whether the agency is providing reasonable . . efforts. ICWA requires the agency to provide active efforts. The Court may decide that the . . effor. ts provided were reasonable and active, reasonable but not active, or neither reasonable nor . . active. . ﬁActive efforts. ﬂ . means affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts intended . primarily to maintain or reunite an Indian child with his or her family. . Where an agency is . involved in the child. -custody proceeding, active efforts must involve assisting the parent or . parents or Indian custodian through the steps of a case plan and with accessing or developing the . . resources necessary to satisfy the case pla. n. To the maximum extent possible, active efforts . . should be provided in a manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural conditions and . . way of life of the Indian child's Tribe and should be conducted in partnership with the Indian . . child and the Indian child's parents, extended family members, Indian custodians, and Tribe. . . Active efforts are to be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the case. . 25 C. F. R. 23. 2. . The . court shall make . detailed . findings . about whether reasonable and active efforts have been . provided to assist the family, what the active efforts were, and whether the efforts have been . . sucessful. . . . If the court finds that (1) appropriate public or private agencies have not made reasonable . . efforts to assist and support the family to accomplish the current permanency goal (s) set out in . . the permanency plan. , (2) the reasonable and prudent parenting standard has not been met, or (3) . Rev. . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 11 the child does not have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally . appropriate activi. ties, then the court will hold another permanency hearing no later than 60 days . following the finding. K. S. A. 38 2264 (f) . . . Preferred Placement. . The Court must document where the child is placed. . If the child is in the custody of . someone other than a parent or Indian custodian, the Court must complete section A, B, or C . . under the ﬁPlacementﬂ section. . The Court must consider each category of preferred placement . . individually in descending order. Starting with the first preferred placement category (a member . . of the child™s extended family) , if the child is not in that category of preferred placement, the . . Court must make specific findings explaining why the child is not placed within that category of . . preferred placement before moving to the next category of preferred placement. For example, if a . . child is placed in an Indian foster home that is licensed by a non. -Indian licensing authority . (placement category . #3) , the court must first make finding explaining why the child is not placed . with a member of the child™s . extended family (. placement category . #1) . Then, the court must . make findings explaining why the child is not placed in a foster home that is licensed by the . . child™s . Tribe. (placement category . #2) . . An Indian child must be placed in the least. -restrictive setting that: (1) most approximates . a family, taking into consideration sibling attachment; (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs . . (if any) to be met; and (3) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child™s home, extended family, . . or siblings. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . Unless the child™s . Tribe. has established a different order of . preference, preference to placement of the child with the following people must be given, in . . descending order as listed below: . (1) A member of the Indian child™s extended family; . . (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child™s Tribe; . (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non. -Indian licensing . authority; or . (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian . organization which has a program suitable to meet the child™s needs. 25 U. S. C. 1915; . . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (b) . . . The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indian child or the Indian . . child™s parent. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (d) . . . . If a party argues there is good cause to deviate from the placement preferences, the court . must allow for all parties to provide evidence and make arguments to the court regarding . . whether there is good cause to deviate. The court must make finding. s on . the record or in writing . about whether the party seeking the departure from the placement preferences has proven this . . through clear and convincing evidence. 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (b) . . As set out in section C, . t. he court™s . finding of good cause should be based on one or more of the following considerations: . . . (1) The request of one or both of the Indian child™s parents, if they attest that they have . reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference; . Rev. . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 12 (2) The request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the . decision that is being made; . (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular . placement; . (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as . specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where . families who meet the placement preferences live; and/or. (5) The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a . dilige. nt search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference . criteria, but none have been located. The standard for determining whether a . . placement is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards . . of the Indian community in which the Indian child™s parent or extended family resides . . or with which the parents or extended family maintains social and cultural ties. 25 . . C. F. R. 23. 132 (c) . . . A placement may not depart from the preferences based on socioeconomic statutes of a. ny . placement relative to another placement; or based solely on ordinary bonding or attachment that . . flowed from time spent in a non. -preferred placement that was made in violation of ICWA. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (d) and (e) . The court should make detailed findings . as to whether the agency has . . made an ongoing, diligent search to locate extended family, a tribal member, or other Indian . . family for placement if the child is not already with a preferred placement pursuant to 25 U. S. C. . . 1915 (b) ; 25 C. F. R. 23. 130 and 23. 131. . . Permanency Goals . .

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
