Identical . . findings may be made for both sections. . . Indian child. This form is to be used if the . state or the court knows or has reason to know that the . child is an Indian child. . The court must ask each participant in the case whether the participant . . knows or has reason to know that the child is an Indian child. . The term ﬁparticipantﬂ is. used. in . the regulations and is meant to be very broad. The goal is to encourage anyone, not just parties, to . . provide information to the court. . The inquiry and all responses should be on the record. The . court must also instruct the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information . that provides reason to know the child is an Indian child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 107 (a) . . If there is reason . to know the child is an Indian child. but the cou. rt does not have sufficient evidence to . determine that the child is or is not an Indian child, the court must treat the child as an . Indian child, unless and until it is determined on the record that the child does not meet the . . definition of an Indian child. . 25 C. F. R. 23. 107 (b) . . The court should document what is the . ﬁreason to know the child is an Indian childﬂ in the space provided in the form. . The state and . . the secretary should be pursuing information required by the Indian Child Welfare Act . (ICWA) , 25 U. S. C. 1901 . et seq. . , at this time. .

(6) The court is informed that either parent or the child possesses an . identification card indicating membership in an Indian Tribe. ﬂ. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 107 (c) . . Standard for Removal. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) requires the court to determine if active efforts. were made to prevent the removal of the Indian child from the home. . ﬁActive effortsﬂ means . . affirmative, active, thorough, and. timely efforts intended primarily to maintain or reunite an . Indian child with his or her family. Where an agency is involved in the child. -custody proceeding, . active efforts must involve assisting the parent or parents or Indian custodian through the steps. of . a case plan and with accessing or developing the resources necessary to satisfy the case plan. To . . the maximum extent possible, active efforts should be provided in a manner consistent with the . . prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life o. f the Indian child's Tribe and should be . . conducted in partnership with the Indian child and the Indian child's parents, extended family . . members, Indian custodians, and Tribe. Active efforts are to be tailored to the facts and . . circumstances of the case. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 2. . . ICWA, . specifically. 25 U. S. C. 1922. , allows the removal of an Indian child in order to . prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. Federal courts have determined this to . . include ﬁcircumstances in which the child is immediately threat. ened with harm, including when . . there is an immediate threat to the safety of the child, when a young child is left without care or . . adequate supervision, or where there is evidence of serious ongoing abuse and the officials have . . reason to fear imminent recu. rrence. ﬂ BIA Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare . Act, December 2016, Section C. 2. (quoting from . Hurlman v. Ric. , 927 F. 2 d 74, 80. -81 [2 d Cit. . 1999] ) . The U. S Department of the Interior interprets the standard that removal of an Indian child . . ﬁis necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harmﬂ as mirroring the constitutional . . standard for removal of . any child from his or her parents without providing due process. BIA . Guidelines, December 2016, Section C. 2. . The court may issue a temporar. y custody order after a hearing and upon making probable . cause findings as required by ASFA and K. S. A. 38. -2243 (i) , which are set out in this form. . The . court must find that the child is likely to sustain imminent physical damage or harm by clear and . . convincing evidence rather than just by probable cause. . . The Kansas . statute. s require. the temporary custody hearing take place within 72 hours (not . including Saturday, Sunday, legal holidays and days on which the clerk of the court is not . Rev. . 7/2019 . ©KSJC. 7 available) of the . executi. on of a protective custody order (Form 106. or 208) or of a child™s being . admitted to a placement while in police protective custody . pursuant to K. S. A. 38 2233 (e) . . ﬁAny emergency removal or placement of an Indian child must terminate immediately . when the . removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent immediate physical damage or . . harm to the child. ﬂ 25 C. F. R. 23. 113 (a) . If the threat has been removed and the child is no longer . . at risk, the State should terminate the removal, either by returning the . child to the parent, Indian . custodian, . or transferring the case to Tribal jurisdiction. However, if circumstances warrant, the . State may instead initiate a child. -custody proceeding to which the full set of ICWA protections . would apply. BIA Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act, December 2016, . . Section C. 3. . ICWA Notice of the Proceeding. . At least 10 days before the adjudication hearing, the parents, Indian custodian, and the . Indian child™s . Tribe. must receive N. otice of the proceedings (For. m 210) by registered or certified . mail with return receipt requested. . The Notice of the proceeding is not required before the . temporary custody hearing. . Copies of the notices of the proceeding . must be sent via registered or . certified mail with return rece. ipt requested to the Department of the Interior by serving Regional . Director of the area office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as indicated in 25 C. F. R. 23. 11 (b) . 25 . . C. F. R. 23. 11 (a) . ﬁNotice may also be sent via personal service or electronically, but su. ch . . alternative methods do not replace the requirement for notice to be sent by registered or certified . . mail with return receipt requested. ﬂ 25 C. F. R. 23. 111 (c) . If the identity or location of the child™s . . parents, the child™s Indian custodian, or the Tribes. in which the Indian child is a member of . eligible for membership cannot be ascertained, but there is reason to know the child is an Indian . . child, notice of the child. -custody proceeding must be sent to the appropriate Bureau of Indian . Affairs Regional Dire. ctor. 25 C. F. R. 23. 111 (e) . . . The Notice of the proceeding is separate from any notice of hearing requirements under . Kansas state law. The Notice of the proceeding must be served on all the required people at the . . beginning of a CINC case before adjudication. and disposition. It must again be served on all the . required people before the court terminates parental rights. . . . An ﬁIndian custodianﬂ means any Indian person who has legal custody of an Indian child . under tribal law or custom or under State law or to w. hom temporary physical care, custody, and . control has been transferred by the parent of such child. 25 U. S. C. 1903 (6) . . . Notice. of hearing. Notice of the temporary custody hearing shall be given to all parties and interested parties . at least 24 hours prior to the hearing. Oral notice may be used if there is insufficien. t time to give . . written notice. . Oral notice is completed upon the filing of a certificate of oral notice (Form 131) . . . . . Rev. . 7/2019 . ©KSJC. 8 Custody and . Placement. If the court awards custody of the child to t. he secretary then the secretary shall have the . authority to designate the placement. . It is best practice for the state agency to strive to provide an . initial placement for the child that meets ICWA™s (or the Tribe™s) placement preferences. This . will help p. revent subsequent disruptions if the child needs to be moved to a preferred placement . once a child. -custody proceeding is initiated. If the Indian child is placed on an emergency basis . in a non. -preferred placement because a preferred placement in unavailable or has not yet met . background check or licensing requirements, the state agency should have a concurrent plan for . . placement as soon as possible with a preferred placement. . . The child must be placed in the least. -restrictive setting that: . (1) most appro. ximates a family, taking into consideration sibling attachment; . . (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs (if any) to be met; and . . (3) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child™s home, extended family, or siblings. . . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . . . . Unless the c. hild™s . Tribe. has established a different order of preference, preference to . placement of the child with the following people must be given, in descending order as listed . . below: . . (1) A member of the Indian child™s extended family; . . (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child™s Tribe; . . (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non. -Indian licensing . authority; or . (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian . organiz. ation which has a program suitable to meet the child™s needs. 25 U. S. C. 1915; . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (b) . . The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indian child or the Indian . . child™s parent. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (d) . . . If the court considers direct placement, ICWA should be consulted. . If the petition alleges that the child is a runaway pursuant to K. S. A. 38. -2202 (d) (9) or . (d) (10) , but the child has not yet been adjudicated as a runaway, then the order may direct that . . the child be detained i. n a secure facility. , but not for more than 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, . Sundays. , legal holidays. , and days on which the clerk of the court is not available. . The time . limitation of 24 hours is the total time perm. itted in a secure facility whether by police protective . . custody or court order. . Length . Emergency. /temporary. proceedings must not extend for longer than necessary to prevent . imminent physical damage or harm to the child. If there is sufficient evidence o. f abuse or . neglect, the state should promptly initiate a proceeding that provides the full suite of due process . . and ICWA protections. BIA Guidelines, December 2016, Section C. 5. Pursuant to 25 C. F. R. . Rev. . 7/2019 . ©KSJC. 9 23. 113 (e) , emergency. /temporary. custody of the Indian chi. ld cannot continue for more than 30 . days unless the court makes the following determinations: . (1) restoring the child to the parent or Indian custodian would subject the child to . imminent physical damage or harm; . (2) the court has been unable to transfer t. he proceeding to the jurisdiction of the . appropriate Indian Tribe; and . (3) it has not been possible to initiate a ﬁchild. -custody proceedingﬂ as defined in 25 . C. F. R. 23. 2. . Other. Order. s . The court may enter a restraining order (Form 134) against any allege. d perpetrator of . physical, sexual, mental or. emotional abuse of the child. This form includes a provision allowing . for issuance of a restraining order pursuant to K. S. A. 38 2255 (d) (4) . .
