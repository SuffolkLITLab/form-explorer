If ICWA applies, use . form 219. . 7 instead of this form. . In addition to the federal ICWA statutes, all federal regulations . (25 C. F. R. 23. ) must be followed.

A. 38 2286, which specified requirements concerning grandpa. rents as potential custodians. . If the . court d. oes not award custody of the child to a parent and, if a grandparent requests custody, the . court shall give substantial consideration when evaluating what custody, visitation or residency . arrangements are in t. he best interests of the child. .

If the child is placed in a qualified residential treatment program (QRTP) . at the time of . the permanency hearing, the court must . make. specialized findings. The court must first . determine whether the ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child does or does . . be met through placement in a foster . 07/2019 ©KSJC 8 . foster home, then the court must determine: whether that placement in a qualified residential . treatment program provides . the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the . least restrictive environment, and whether the placement is consistent with the short. -term and . long term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. The court. must . also make specific findings of fact regarding: the specific treatment or service needs that will be . met for the child in the QRTP placement; the length of time the child is expected to need the . treatment or services; and the efforts made by the secre. tary to prepare the child to return home or . to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster . family home. . The court, after hearing or based on citizen review board recommendations, shall . determine whet. her the child will be reintegrated with a parent, placed for adoption, placed with a . permanent custodian, or placed in another planned. permanent living arrangement. . As set out in . the form, the court shall make reasonable efforts findings. . Upon finding that. reintegration . continues to be a viable alternative, the court may rescind prior dispositional orders and enter any . dispositional order authorized by the code, or order that a new . reintegration plan be prepared. . Upon finding that reintegration is no longer. a viable alternative, the court shall make the . considerations and findings set out in the form. If reintegration is not a viable alternative and . either adoption or appointment of a permanent custodian might be in the best interests of the . child, then the . county or district attorney shall file a motion to terminate parental rights or a . motion to appoint a permanent custodian within 30 days, and the court shall set a hearing on such . motion within 90 days of the filing of the motion. </div>
