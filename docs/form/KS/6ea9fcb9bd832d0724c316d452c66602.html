A. . 38 2202, . 38 2247, 38. -2251 and 42 U. S. C. §671 . et seq. . Notes on Use. . When using this form no other journal entry is required or advised. This form is complete . in . and of itself, reciting appearances and allowing space for findings and orders of the court. . If this is the first order relieving a parent of custody and authorizing out of home . placement. or the first order of removal when the child has been ho. me for six months or longer . (as in an informal supervision) , . Form 107 must be used. . Failure to make and properly . document the findings required by . the Adoption and Safe Families Act (. ASFA. ) in the initial . order authorizing out of home placement will result in the loss of federal funding. for. the child in . the present case. . When a court has reason to . know a child involved in a child in need of care proceeding is . an Indian child, the Indian . Child Welfare Act (ICWA) applies; notice requirements, findings and . procedure are dictated by ICWA, and . the ICWA forms must be used. . If ICWA applies, use form . 215. 1 instead of this form. . In addition to the federal ICWA statutes, all federal regulations (25. C. F. R. 23) must be followed. The court should also consult the BIA December 2016 guidelines . (www. bia. gov/bia/ois/dhs/icwa. ) . . The court must ask each participant in the case whether the participant knows or has reason . to know that the child is an Indian c. hild. The inquiry and all responses should be on the record. . The term ﬁparticipantﬂ is . used . in the regulations and is meant to be very broad. The goal is to . encourage anyone, not just parties, to provide information to the court. . The court must also instru. ct . the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason to . know the child is an Indian child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 107 (a) . . If there is reason to know the child is an . Indian child. but the court does not have sufficient evide. nce to determine that the child is or . is not an Indian child, the court must treat the child as an Indian child, unless and until it is . . determined on the record that the child does not meet the definition of an Indian child. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 107 (b) . . The court . ﬁhas reason to knowﬂ a child is an Indian child if: . ﬁ (1) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the . proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the . court that the child is an Indian child; . (2) Any particip. ant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the . proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the . court that it has discovered information indicating that the child is an . Indian child; . (3) The child who is the subject of the . proceeding gives the court reason to . know he or she is an Indian child; . (4) The court is informed that the domicile or residence of the child, the . child™s parents, or the child™s Indian custodian is on a reservation or in . an Alaska Native village; . Rev. . 08/20. 21 ©KSJC. 7 (5) The . court is informed that the child is or has been a ward of a Tribal . court; or. (6) The court is informed that either parent or the child possesses an . identification card indicating membership in an Indian Tribe. ﬂ 25 C. F. R. . 23. 107 (c) . . . Adjudication hearings . are now open to the public, unless the court determines that closed . proceedings, or the exclusion of a specific person, are in the best interests of the child or are . . necessary to protect the privacy rights of the parents. . The court may exclude the public d. uring . the presentation of evidence that is confidential (see K. S. A. 38. -2209) or conduct an . in camera. inspection. . The court may not exclude the guardian . ad litem. , parties or interested parties. . The . court shall permit the attendance of up to two people who h. ave been designated by the parent as . . allies, if they have participated in a parent ally orientation program approved by the judicial . administrator. . An ally may be removed if the ally becomes disruptive or has been disruptive in a . prior proceeding. . K. S. A. . 38 2247. Once a case is filed, an adjudicatory hearing shall be held without undue delay, and . within 60 days from the date the child was removed from the home, if applicable. . K. S. A. 38. -2251 provides that if the court does not find by clear and convincing. evidence, pursuant to . K. S. A. 38. -2250, that the child is a child in need of care, then the court shall dismiss the . proceedings. . This form provides for dismissal as to some parties and adjudication as to others. . . If a grandparent requests custody, the form facilitates documentation required by . K. S. A. . 38 2286, which specified requirements concerning grandparents as potential custodians. . If the . court does not award custody of the child to a parent and, if a grandparent. requests custody, the . court shall give substantial consideration when evaluating what custody, visitation or residency . . arrang. ements are in the best interests of the child. . Relevant factors to be considered include . wishes of the parents, child and grandpar. ent; the extent to which the grandparent has cared for, . nurtured and supported the child; the intent and circumstances under which the child is placed . with the grandparent, including whether domestic violence is a factor and whether the child is . . placed to . allow the parent to seek work or attend school; and the physical and mental health of . all individuals involved. . . The court may enter an order for one or both parents to pay child support, and shall enter . a child support order if the secretary is granted . custody of the child. . If the court awards custody . of the child to the secretary. , the secretary shall have the authority to place the child, and the court . may make placement recommendations. . If the court awards custody to the secretary, the court . shall prov. ide the secretary with a copy of any orders entered. . . In the statutory definition of ﬁchild in need of care, ﬂ K. S. A. . 38 2202 (d) (6) . references . K. S. A. 72. -977 and 72. -1111; however, in 2017 the contents of K. S. A. 72. -977 and 72. -1111 were . transferred to K. S. A. . 72 3421 and 72. -3120 respectively. While the definition in K. S. A. . 38 2202 (d) (6) . still includes incorrect statutory references, to provide clarity this form has been . updated to include correct statutory references. . Rev. . 08/2021. ©KSJC. 8 When. the term. ﬁorﬂ stands. alone between. optional findings/orders, . more . than . one choice . may. be checked. . Each. choice checked. must. be justified. as instructed, . e. g. specify. basis for . finding. </div>
