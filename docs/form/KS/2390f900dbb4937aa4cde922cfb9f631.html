This form is to be used only if, at the time of the permanency hearing, the child is placed . . in a qualified residential treatment program (QRTP) . . .

Supreme Court Rule 174. requires the use of this form or another form approved by the . Sup. reme Court as meeting . the Adoption and Safe Families Act (. ASFA. ) . requirements. Failure to . make and properly document the findings required by ASFA will result in the loss of federal . . funding. Federal funding is not available when. the court finds reasonable efforts have not been . made unless the court also finds the efforts were not required. The loss of federal funding . . continues until the court finds reasonable efforts have been made and the court™s findings are . . properly documented. . . . If the permanency hearing. is for a child 14 years of age or older, the court shall require . notice of the time and place of the permanency hearing.

After termination of parental rights permanency hearings continue to be required at least . every 12 months from the d. ate the child first entered out. -of-. home placement. Termination of . parental rights does not change the requirement for permanency hearings, and they shall continue . . until the child is adopted. , a permanent custodian is appointed. or jurisdiction is terminated. . During the permanency hearing the . court shall consider whether reasonable efforts have been . made to achieve the case plan goals. If the court determines that reasonable efforts have not been . . made or progress is not sufficient, the court may rescind its prior orders and enter other orders . . regarding custody and adoption that are approp. riate under the circumstances. . K. S. A. 38 2264 (h) . . When a court has reason to know a child involved in a child in need of care proceeding is . . an Indian child, the Indian Child We. lfare Act (ICWA) applies; notice . requirements, findings and . procedure are dictated by ICWA, and . the ICWA forms must be used. . If ICWA applies, use . form 221. 7 instead of this form. . In addition to the federal ICWA statutes, all federal regulations . (25 C. F. R. 23) must be followed. The court should also consult the BIA December 2016 . . guidelines (www. bia. gov/bia/ois/dhs/icwa) . . . The court must ask each participant in the case whether the participant knows or has . reason to know that the child is an Indian child. The inquiry and all responses should be on the . . record. The term ﬁparticipantﬂ is used in the regulations and is meant to be very broad. The goal . . is to encourage anyone, not just parties, to provide information to the court. The court must also . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 6 instruct the parties to inform the court if the. y subsequently receive information that provides . reason to know the child is an Indian child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 107 (a) . . If there is reason to know the . child is an Indian child but the court does not have sufficient evidence to d. etermine that the . . child is or is . not an Indian child, the court must treat the child as an Indian child, unless . . and until it is determined on the record that the child does not meet the definition of an . . Indian child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 107 (b) . . The court ﬁhas rea. son to knowﬂ a child is an Indian . child if: . . ﬁ (1) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the . proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the . . court that the child is an Indian child; . (2) Any participant in . the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the . proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the . . court that it has discovered information indicating that the child is an . . Indian child; . (3) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to . know he or she is an Indian child; . (4) The court is informed that the domicile or residence of the child, the . child™s parents, or the child™s Indian custodian is on a reservation or in . . an Alaska Native village; . (5) The court is informed that the child is or h. as been a ward of a Tribal . court; or . (6) The court is informed that either parent or the child possesses an . identification card indicating membership in an Indian Tribe. ﬂ 25 . . C. F. R. 23. 107 (c) . . . If the court finds that (1) appropriate public or private agen. cies have not made reasonable . efforts to assist and support the family to accomplish the current permanency goal (s) set out in . . the permanency plan. , (2) the reasonable and prudent parenting standard has not been met, or (3) . the child does not have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally . . appropriate activities, then the court will hold another permanency hearing no later than 60 days . . following the finding. K. S. A. 38 2264 (f) . . . . If the child is placed . in a qualified residential treatment program (QRTP) at the time of . the permanency hearing, the court must . make. specialized findings. The court must first . determine whether the ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child does or does . . not supp. ort the determination that the ch. ild™s needs cannot be met through placement in a foster . family home. If the court determines that the child™s needs cannot be met through placement in a . . foster home, then the court must determine: whether that placement in a qualified residential . . treatment. program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the . least restrictive environment, and whether the placement is consistent with the short. -term and . long-. term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. The court must . also make specific findings of fact regarding: the specific treatment or service needs that will be . . met for the child in the QRTP placement; the length of time the child is expected to need the . . treat. ment or services; and the efforts. made by the secretary to prepare the child to return home or . to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster . . family home. </div>
