The court shall make . findings as to why the child is in need of either continued placement . outside the parent™s home or continued supervision, articulating the clear and convincing . . evidence that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian would likely resu. lt . in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. 25 U. S. C. 1912 (e) . The evidence must . . show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the home and the likehood that . . continued custody of the child will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the . . particular child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 121 (c) . Without the causal relationship, evidence that shows only . . the existence of community or family poverty, single parenthood, custodian age, crowded or . . inadequate house, substance abuse, or nonconforming social behavior does not by itself . . constitute clear and convincing evidnece that continued custody is likely to result in serious . . emotional or physical damage to the child. 25 C.

The Court must decide whether the appropriate public or private agencies have made (1) . reasonable efforts . and (2) active efforts to assist and support the family to accomplish the current . permanency goal (s) .

Where an agency is . . involved in the child. -custody proceeding, active efforts must involve assisting the parent or . parents or Indian custodian through the steps of a case plan and with accessing or developing the . . resources necessary to satisfy the case plan. To the maximum extent possible, active efforts . . should be provided in a manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural conditions and . . way of life of the Indian child's Tribe and should be conducted in partnership with the Indian . child and the Indian child's parents, extended family members, Indian custodians, and Tribe. . . Active efforts are to be tailored to the facts and circumstances of th. e case. . 25 C. F. R. 23. 2. . The . court shall make . detailed . findings . about whether reasonable and active efforts have been . provided to assist the family, what the active efforts were, and whether the efforts have been . . sucessful. . . Rev. . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 11 If the court finds that (1) app. ropriate public or private agencies have not made reasonable . efforts to assist and support the family to accomplish the current permanency goal (s) set out in . . the permanency plan. , (2) the reasonable and prudent parenting standard has not been met, or (3) . the child does not have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally . appropriate activities, then the court will hold another permanency hearing no later than 60 days . . following the finding. K. S. A. 38 2264 (f) . . Preferred Placement. . The C. ourt must document where the child is placed. . If the child is in the custody of . someone other than a parent or Indian custodian, the Court must complete section A, B, or C . . under the ﬁPlacementﬂ section. . The Court must consider each category of preferred pl. acement . individually in descending order. Starting with the first preferred placement category (a member . . of the child™s extended family) , if the child is not in that category of preferred placement, the . . Court must make specific findings explaining why the . child is not placed within that category of . . preferred placement before moving to the next category of preferred placement. For example, if a . . child is placed in an Indian foster home that is licensed by a non. -Indian licensing authority . (placement category . #3) , the court must first make finding explaining why the child is not placed . with a member of the child™s extended family (. placement category . #1) . Then, the court must . make findings explaining why the child is not placed in a foster home that is licensed b. y the . child™s . Tribe. (placement category . #2) . . An Indian child must be placed in the least. -restrictive setting that: (1) most approximates . a family, taking into consideration sibling attachment; (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs . . (if any) to be met. ; and (3) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child™s home, extended family, . or siblings. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . Unless the child™s . Tribe. has established a different order of . preference, preference to placement of the child with the following people must be given, in . . descending order as listed below: . (1) A member of the Indian child™s extended family; . . (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child™s Tribe; . . (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized. non-. Indian licensing . authority; or . (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian . organization which has a program suitable to meet the child™s needs. 25 U. S. C. 1915; . . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (b) . . . The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indian child or the Indian . . child™s parent. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (d) . . . . If a party argues there is good cause to deviate from the placement preferences, the court . must allow for all parties to provide evidence and make. arguments to the court regarding . whether there is good cause to deviate. The court must make finding. s . on the record or in writing . about whether the party seeking the departure from the placement preferences has proven this . . through clear and convincing evidence. 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (b) . . As set out in section C, . t. he court™s . finding of good cause should be based on one or more of the following considerations: . . Rev. . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 12 (1) The request of one or both of the Indian child™s parents, if they attest that they have . reviewed th. e placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference; . (2) The request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the . decision that is being made; . (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular . placement; . (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as . specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where . families who meet the placement preferences liv. e; and/or . (5) The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a . diligent search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference . . criteria, but none have been located. The standard for determining whether . a . placement is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards . . of the Indian community in which the Indian child™s parent or extended family resides . . or with which the parents or extended family maintains social and cultural ties. 2. 5 C. F. R. 23. 132 (c) . . . A placement may not depart from the preferences based on socioeconomic statutes of any . placement relative to another placement; or based solely on ordinary bonding or attachment that . . flowed from time spent in a non. -preferred placement. that was made in violation of ICWA. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (d) and (e) . The court should make detailed findings as to whether the agency has . . made an ongoing, diligent search to locate extended family, a tribal member, or other Indian . . family for placement if the . child is not already with a preferred placement pursuant to 25 U. S. C. . . 1915 (b) ; 25 C. F. R. 23. 130 and 23. 131. . . Permanency Goals . . The court, based on citizen review board recommendations, shall determine whether the . child will be reintegrated with a parent, . placed for adoption, placed with a permanent custodian, . . or placed in another planned permanent living arrangement. . Upon finding that reintegration . continues to be a viable. goal. , the court may rescind prior dispositional orders and enter any . dispositional order authorized by the code, or order that a new reintegration plan be prepared. . . Upon finding that reintegration is no longer a viable. goal. , the court shall make the considerations . and findings set out in the form. .

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
