If a . party argues there is good cause to deviate from the placement preferences, the court . must. allow for all parties to provide evidence and make arguments to the court regarding whether . there is good cause to deviate. The court must. make finding. s on the recor. d or in writing about . whether the party seeking the departure from the placement preferences has proven this through . clear and convincing evidence. 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (b) . The court™s finding of good cause should be . based on one or more of the following consi. derations: . (1) The request of one or both of the Indian child™s parents, if they attest that they have . reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference; . (2) The request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and c. apacity to understand the . decision that is being made; . (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular . placement; . (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as . specialize. d treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where families . who meet the placement preferences live; and/or. (5) The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a . diligent search was conducted to find sui. table placements meeting the preference . criteria, but none have been located. The standard for determining whether a placement . is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian . . community in which the Indian child™s p. arent or extended family resides or with which . the parents or extended family maintains social and cultural ties. 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (c) . . . A placement may not depart from the preferences based on socioeconomic statutes of any . placement relative to another pl. acement; or based solely on ordinary bonding or attachment that . flowed from time spent in a non. -preferred placement that was made in violation of ICWA. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (d) and (e) . . The court should make detailed findings as to whether the agency has . made a. n ongoing, diligent search to locate extended family, a tribal member, or other Indian family . for placement if the child is not already with a preferred placement pursuant to 25 U. S. C. 1915 (b) ; . 25 C. F. R. 23. 130 and 23. 131. . Rev. . 08/20. 21 ©KSJC. 13 Clarity and . Translation. The court should write the order in easily understandable language that allows the parent (s) . or Indian custodian to fully understand what action they must take to have the child returned to . . their care. An interpreter should be provided for a . parent or Indian custodian whose first language . is not English. Compliance with ICWA is jurisdictional. Failure to comply with ICWA may render . orders devoid of authority. . Tribe</div>

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
