I, and III. category, shall. be placed in the custody of the secretary of corrections for placement in a youth . residential facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. This presumption may be . rebutted by findings on the record that the juvenile offender poses a significant risk of physica. l harm to . another. K. S. A. 38 23. 69 (e) . . . The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 2002, 42 U. S. C. 5601, prohibits . detention of status offenders or non. -criminal traffic or fish and game offenders in any secure facility, . except for a minimal period (6 hours under K. S. A. 38. -2332) for investigation or identification, but . always sight and sound separate from adult prisoners if the site is an adult jail. . . Permanency hearings must be held every twelv. e (12) months thereafter as required by K. S. A. . 38 2365 (e) until the juvenile is discharged from custody pursuant to K. S. A. 38. -2376 (a) . If held . immediately before release and the juvenile is placed in an eligible placement after release, this will . . permit th. e state to immediately draw down Title IV funding, thus avoiding a loss of funding for . communities. . . Although the court may order a drug and alcohol evaluation pursuant to K. S. A. 38 2361 (a) (4) . and (b) (2) , the fee is payable by the juvenile offender in an amount not to exceed the fee established by . . the relevant statute providing for such evaluation. The court may waive the evaluation under certain . . circumstances described in K. S. A. 38. -2361 (b) (2) . If the juvenile offender and those legally liable for . the juvenile™s support are indigent, the court may waive the fee. In no event shall the fee be assessed . . against the secretary or department of corrections, or the secretary or department for children and . . families if the juvenile is in the secretary™s care custody a. nd control. . . Although proceedings under the juvenile justice code are considered civil proceedings, an . adjudication as a juvenile offender may be a consideration in the imposition of an adult sentence for a . . subsequent conviction under the criminal code. See . In re Gault. , 387 U. S. 1, 18 L. Ed. 2 d 527, 87 S. Ct. . 1428 (1967) ; . Apprendi v. New Jersey. , 530 U. S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2 d 435 (2000) ; . State . . v. Limon. , 280 Kan. 275, 283, 122 P. 3 d 22 (2005) . . . If this form is being used in conjunction with a violation of sentence and detention is ordered, . the court should also use Form 370 Œ .
