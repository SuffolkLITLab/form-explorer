Attorney in fact. State of Kansas. County of . This instrument was acknowledged before me on. , . , by. . Notarial Officer. Title. (SEAL) . My Appointment Expires: . Rev. . KSJC . 12/2021. 9 Reference. K. S. A. 58. -650 to 58. -665; 58. -4809; 58. -4810. . Comment. The Judicial Council is providing this form power of attorney as required by K. S. A. . 58 652 (g) . A power of attorney authorizes another person (your attorney in fact) to make . decisions and take actions concerning your money and property for you (the princip. al) . . If you have questions about the power of attorney or the authority you are granting . to your attorney in fact, you should seek legal advice before signing this form. . Under Kansas law, a power of attorney may be either durable or . nondurable. A . durable power of attorney will remain in effect even if the principal becomes disabled or . . incapacitated (Option A) , and it can be written to take effect only when the principal . becomes disabled or incapacitated, also known as a ﬁspringingﬂ d. urable power of . attorney (Option B) . A nondurable power of attorney is no longer effective if the . . principal becomes disabled or incapacitated. (Option C) . . The form power of attorney prepared by the Judicial Council is drafted as a durable . power of atto. rney that becomes effective immediately and remains in effect even if the . principal becomes disabled or incapacitated (Option A) , because that is the structure most . people use when drafting a power of attorney. However, alternative language for Options . B and C is included below. . Option B. - If the principal wants to create a ﬁspringingﬂ durable power of attorney, the . following language should be substituted for paragraphs (2) and (3) of the form: . (2) This is a durable power of attorney and the authority o. f my attorney . in fact, when effective, shall not terminate or be void or voidable if I . . am or become disabled or in the event of later uncertainty as to whether . I am dead or alive. . (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this document, this power . of a. ttorney shall become effective only upon the disability of the . principal. The rights, powers and authorities of my attorney in fact shall . commence only upon my disability and shall remain in full force until . such disability is terminated. Disability shal. l be the condition as . defined in K. S. A. 58. -651 (c) . Such condition shall be conclusively . determined by a written declaration of my attending physician. . In addition, if the durable power of attorney is springing, the following or . substantially similar lang. uage relating to medical records should be included: . . I intend for my attorney in fact to be treated as I would be with respect . to my rights regarding the use and disclosure of my individually . Rev. . KSJC . 12/2021. 10 identifiable health information or other medical records. This release . authority applies to any information governed . by the Health Insurance . Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) , 42 USC 1320 d . and 45 CFR 160. -164. . I authorize any physician, healthcare professional, dentist, health plan, . hospital, clinic, laboratory, pharmacy or other covered health care . prov. ider, any insurance company and the Medical Information Bureau, . Inc. , or other health care clearinghouse that has provided treatment or . services to me or that has paid for or is seeking payment from me for . such services to give, disclose and release to my . agent, without . restrictions, all of my individually identifiable health information and . medical records regarding any past, present of future medical or mental . health condition, including but not limited to information relating to the . diagnosis and treatme. nt of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, . mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse. . . The authority given my attorney in fact shall supersede any prior . agreement that I may have made with my health care providers to . restrict access to or disclosure of. my individually identifiable health . information. The authority given my attorney in fact has no expiration . . date and shall expire only in the event that I revoke such authority in . writing and deliver it to my health care provider. . Option C. Œ If the princi. pal wants to create a nondurable power of attorney, the word . ﬁdurableﬂ should be stricken from the title of the form, and the following language should . be substituted for paragraph (2) : . This power of attorney is not durable, and the authority of my attorn. ey . in fact shall be suspended during any period that I am disabled to the . . extent that I am unable to receive or evaluate information or to . communicate decisions with respect to the subject of the power of . attorney. . Paragraph (4) begins with the statuto. ry language from K. S. A. 58. -654 which delegates . general powers to the attorney in fact to act on the principal™s behalf with respect to all . . lawful subjects and purposes. This is all that is required. However, additional paragraphs . specifically enumerating s. pecific powers are included in the form because some drafters . may prefer such enumeration. . The granting of the optional additional powers contained in paragraph (6) are . important decisions. The Committee suggests a thorough discussion of these powers with. counsel as to their tax, estate planning and other consequences. The principal should . initial next to each specific power, indicating whether that power is included or excluded. . If neither line is initialed, the presumption will be that the power is excl. uded. . Rev. . KSJC . 12/2021. 11 If a successor attorney in fact is designated (see bracketed language in paragraph 1) . and the principal does not want the successor attorney in fact to have the same optional . additional powers as the original attorney in fact, an additional section. should be added, . in which the principal indicates whether each optional additional power is included or . . excluded as to the successor attorney in fact. . . If the optional additional power to consent on behalf of the principal to the sale, gift, . transfer, mor. tgage or other alienation of the principal™s homestead in section (6) (j) is . . chosen, the subsection entitled ﬁConsent of Spouseﬂ is required by K. S. A. 58. -654 (f) (10) . and must be included. If this optional power is not included, the ﬁConsent of Spouseﬂ . subsec. tion need not be included. . A person who is appointed an attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney has . no duty to exercise the authority conferred in the power of attorney, unless the attorney . in fact has agreed expressly in writing to act for . the principal in such circumstances. The . subsection entitled ﬁAcceptance of Authority and Agreement to Actﬂ provides for such . express written agreement to act; however, it is optional. . If a person appoints more than one attorney in fact, the power of atto. rney should state . whether such attorneys in fact must act jointly or may act independently. If the power of . attorney does not specify, then K. S. A. 58. -653 requires attorneys in fact to act jointly. . In 2017, Kansas enacted the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Acc. ess to Digital Assets Act . (RUFADAA) , K. S. A. 58. -4801 . et seq. . The RUFADAA provides a mechanism for an . attorney in fact to obtain access to a principal™s digital assets from a custodian that is . maintaining or storing those digital assets. Under the RUFADAA. , a general grant of . authority in a power of attorney is sufficient to provide the attorney in fact with authority . over all of the principal™s digital assets, including a catalogue of the principal™s electronic . communications but not the content of those c. ommunications. K. S. A. 58. -4810. The . RUFADAA distinguishes between the content of electronic communications, which . includes the subject line and text of email, text messages, and other private messages, . and the catalogue of electronic communications, which i. ncludes the list of senders, . recipients, and the date and time of the message. K. S. A. 58. -4802. An attorney in fact . may access the content of electronic communications only if the power of attorney . explicitly grants such authority. K. S. A. 58. -4809. The optio. nal additional power in . paragraph (6) (m) is intended to authorize such access. </div>
