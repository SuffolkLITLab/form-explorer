If the court determines that reasonable. efforts have not been made or progress is not . sufficient, the court may rescind its prior orders and enter other orders regarding custody and . . adoption that are appropriate under the circumstances. .

A sample report . . form may be obtained on the Kansas Judi. cial Council website or . through the Office of Judicial . Administration. . Identifying the Tribe (s) . . The court must determine whether the child™s . Tribe. has been identified and whether the . Tribe. has been afforded a full opportunity to participate in the proceedings. If so, the court must . determine whether the agency provided the child™s . Tribe. with copies of the petition, reports, and . information concerning the child in a timely manner. 25 U. S. C. 1911 (c) & (d) ; 25 U. S. C. . . 1912 (a) . . . . Rev. . 7/2019 . ©KSJC. 8 Prior Termination of Parental Rights . The date of termination or relinquishment of parental rights should be recited for each . child and parent as set out in the form. . If the parent of an Indian child voluntary relinquishes . parental rights or consents to an adoption, 25 U. S. C. 1913 provides the parent may withdraw the . relinquishment for consent for any reason prior to a final decree of termination or adoption. . . In the court™s termination of parental rights order, the court found that active efforts . had . failed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that the continued custody of the child by . . the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional of physical damage to the . . child. Therefore, it is unnecessary for the court to make those findings again at this permanen. cy . . hearing. . BIA Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act, December 2016, . Section E. 5. . . . If the court finds that (1) appropriate public or private agencies have not made reasonable . . efforts to assist and support the family to accomplish the current permanency goal (s) set out in . . the permanency plan. , (2) the reasonable and prudent parenting standard has not been met, or (3) . the child does not have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally . . appropriate activities, then the court will hold another permanency hearing no later than 60 days . . following the finding. K. S. A. 38 2264 (f) . . Preferred Placement. . The Court must document where the child is placed. . T. he Court must complete section A, . B, or C under the ﬁPlacementﬂ section. . The Court must consider each category of preferred . placement individually in descending order. Starting with the first preferred placement category . . (a member of the child™s extended family) , if the child is not in that category of preferred . . placement, the. Court must make specific findings explaining why the child is not placed within . that category of preferred placement before moving to the next category of preferred placement. . . For example, if a child is placed in an Indian foster home that is licensed by a non. -Indian . . licensing authority (#3) , the court must first make finding explaining why the child is not placed . . with a member of the child™s extended family (#1) . Then, the court must make findings . . explaining why the child is not placed in a foster home that is licensed by the child™s . Tribe. (#2) . . An Indian child must be placed in the least. -restrictive setting that: (1) most approximates . a family, taking into consideration sibling attachment; (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs . . (if any) to be met; a. nd (3) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child™s home, extended family, . or siblings. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . Unless the child™s . Tribe. has established a different order of . preference, preference to placement of the child with the following people must be given, in . . descending order as listed below: . . (1) A member of the Indian child™s extended family; . . (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child™s Tribe; . (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non. -Indian licensing . authority; or . (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian . organization which has a program suitable to meet the child™s needs. 25 U. S. C. 1915; . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (b) . . Rev. . 7/2019 . ©KSJC. 9 The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indian child or the Indian . child™s parent. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (d) . . . . If a party argues there is good cause to deviate from the placement preferences, the court . must allow for all parties to provide evidence and make arguments to the court regarding . . whether there is good cause to deviate. The court must make finding. s . on the record or in writing . about whether the party seeking the departure from the placement preferences has proven this . . through clear and convincing evidence. . 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (b) . The court™s finding of good cause . should be based on one or more of the following considerations: . . (1) The request of one or both of the Indian child™s parents, if they attest that they have . reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference; . (2) The request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the . decision that is being made; . (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular . placement; . (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as . specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where . . families who meet the placement preferences live; and/or. (5) The unavailabili. ty of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a . diligent search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference . . criteria, but none have been located. The standard for determining whether a . . placement is unavailable must. conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards . of the Indian community in which the Indian child™s parent or extended family resides . . or with which the parents or extended family maintains social and cultural ties. 25 . . C. F. R. 23. 132 (c) . . . A placeme. nt may not depart from the preferences based on socioeconomic statutes of any . placement relative to another placement; or based solely on ordinary bonding or attachment that . . flowed from time spent in a non. -preferred placement that was made in violation of ICWA. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (d) and (e) . The court should make detailed findings as to whether the agency has . . made an ongoing, diligent search to locate extended family, a tribal member, or other Indian . . family for placement if the child is not already with a pre. ferred placement pursuant to 25 U. S. C. . 1915 (b) ; 25 C. F. R. 23. 130 and 23. 131. . . Compliance with ICWA is jurisdictional. Failure to comply with ICWA may render . orders devoid of authority. </div>
