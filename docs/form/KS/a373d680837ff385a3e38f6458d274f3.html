This form is to be used only if, at the time of the permanency hearing, the Indian child is . . placed in a qualified residential treatment program (QRTP) . .

Failure to make and properly document . the findings required by ASFA will result . in the loss of federal funding. . Federal funding is not available when the court finds reasonable . efforts have not been made unless the court also finds the efforts were not required. . The loss of . federal funding continues until the court finds reasonable efforts have been made. and the court™s . findings are properly documented. . . Timing of permanency hearing. . After termination of parental rights, permanency hearings continue to be required at least . every 12 months from. the date the child first entered out of home placement. . Termination of . parental rights does not change the requirement for permanency hearings, and they shall continue . . until the child is adopted or a permanent custodian is appointed. . During the permanency. hearing . the court shall consider whether reasonable. efforts have been made to achieve the case plan . goals. . If the court determines that reasonable. efforts have not been made or progress is not . sufficient, the court may rescind its prior orders and enter other orders regarding custody and . . adoption that are appropriate under the circumstances. . K. S. A. 38 2264 (h) . . Notice. Notice of a permanency hearing is dictated by K. S. A. 38. -2265. . If the permanency . hearing is for a child 14 years of age or older, the court shall require notice of the time and place . . of the permanency hearing. be sent to the child. . K. S. A. 38. -2265 (a) (2) . . The notice shall request . the child™s participation in the hearing by attendance or by report to the court. A sample report . . form may be obtained on the Kansas Judicial Council website or . through the Office of Judicial . . Administration. . Identifying the Tribe (s) . . The court must determine whether the child™s . Tribe. has been identified and whether the . Tribe. has bee. n afforded a full opportunity to participate in the proceedings. If so, the court must . determine whether the agency provided the child™s . Tribe. with copies of the petition, reports, and . information concerning the child in a timely manner. 25 U. S. C. 1911 (c) & (d) ; 25 U. S. C. . . 1912 (a) . . . . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 8 Prior Termination of Parental Rights . The date of termination or relinquishment of parental rights should be recited for each . child and parent as set out in the form. . If the parent of an Indian child voluntary relinquishes . paren. tal rights or consents to an adoption, 25 U. S. C. 1913 provides the parent may withdraw the . relinquishment for consent for any reason prior to a final decree of termination or adoption. . In the court™s termination of parental rights order, the court found t. hat active efforts . had . failed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that the continued custody of the child by . . the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional of physical damage to the . . child. Therefore, it is unnecessary for the court to make those findings again at this permanency . . hearing. . BIA Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act, December 2016, . Section E. 5. . . . If the court finds that (1) appropriate public or private agencies have not made reasonable . . efforts to assist and support the family to accomplish the current permanency goal (s) set out in . the permanency plan. , (2) the reasonable and prudent parenting standard has not been met, or (3) . the child does not have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally . . appropriate activities, then the court will hold another permanency hearing no later than 60 days . . following the finding. K. S. A. 38 2264 (f) . . . Preferred Placement. . The Court must document where the child is placed. . An Indian child. must be placed in . the least. -restrictive setting that: (1) most approximates a family, taking into consideration sibling . attachment; (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs (if any) to be met; and (3) is in reasonable . . proximity to the Indian child™s home, extended family, or siblings. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . Unless . . the child™s . Tribe. has established a different order of preference, preference to placement of the . child with the following people must be given, in descending order as listed below: . . (1) A membe. r of the Indian child™s extended family; . (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child™s Tribe; . . (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non. -Indian licensing . authority; or . (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian . organization which has a program suitable to meet the child™s needs. 25 U. S. C. 1915; . . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (b) . . . The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indian child or the Indian . . child™s parent. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (d) . . . . Because the child™s placement in a qualified residential treatment program is unlikely to . fall within any of the ICWA or Tribe™s preferred placement categories, this form assumes the . . Court will make findings. about whether there is good cause to deviate from the placement . preferences. The Court must also make all the required findings about the QRTP placement. . . . If a party argues there is good cause to deviate from the placement preferences, the court . 07/2019 . ©KSJC. 9 must all. ow for all parties to provide evidence and make arguments to the court regarding . whether there is good cause to deviate. The court must make finding. s . on the record or in writing . about whether the party seeking the departure from the placement preferences h. as proven this . through clear and convincing evidence. 25 C. F. R. 23. 132 (b) . The court™s finding of good cause . . should be based on one or more of the following considerations: . . (1) The request of one or both of the Indian child™s parents, if they attest that they have . reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference; . (2) The request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the . decision that is being made; . (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular . placement; . (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as . specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where . . families who meet the plac. ement preferences live; and/or. (5) The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a . diligent search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference . . criteria, but none have been located. The standard for. determining whether a . placement is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards . . of the Indian community in which the Indian child™s parent or extended family resides . . or with which the parents or extended family maintains social. and cultural ties. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (c) . . . A placement may not depart from the preferences based on socioeconomic statutes of any . placement relative to another placement; or based solely on ordinary bonding or attachment that . . flowed from time spent in a no. n preferred placement that was made in violation of ICWA. 25 . C. F. R. 23. 132 (d) and (e) . The court should make detailed findings as to whether the agency has . . made an ongoing, diligent search to locate extended family, a tribal member, or other Indian . . family . for placement if the child is not already with a preferred placement pursuant to 25 U. S. C. . 1915 (b) ; 25 C. F. R. 23. 130 and 23. 131. . . . If the child is placed in a qualified residential treatment program (QRTP) at the time of . the permanency hearing, the court m. ust make specialized findings. The court must first . determine whether the ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child does or does . . not support the determination that the child™s needs cannot be met through placement in a foster . . family home. If the court determines that the child™s needs cannot be met through placement in a . . foster home, then the court must determine: whether that placement in a qualified residential . . treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care fo. r the child in the . least restrictive environment, and whether the placement is consistent with the short. -term and . long-. term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. The court must . also make specific findings of fact regarding. : the specific treatment or service needs that will be . met for the child in the QRTP placement; the length of time the child is expected to need the . . treatment or services; and the efforts made by the secretary to prepare the child to return home or . to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster . family home. . Compliance with ICWA is jurisdictional. Failure to comply with ICWA may render . orders devoid of authority. </div>
