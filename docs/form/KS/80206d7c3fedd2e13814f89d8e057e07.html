This form is to be used if the . state or the court knows or. has reason to know that the . child is an Indian child. If there is reason to know the child is an Indian child. but the court . does not have sufficient evidence to determine that the child is or is not an Indian child, the . . court must treat the child as an In. dian child, unless and until it is determined on the record . that the child does not meet the definition of an Indian child. 25 C. F. R. 23. 107 (b) . . The court . should document what is the ﬁreason to know the child is an Indian childﬂ in the space provided . . in th. e form. . The state and the secretary should be pursuing information required by the . Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) , 25 U. S. C. 1901 . et seq. . at this time. . Before issuing the . order, the court should ask whether the participants know or have reason to know tha. t the child is . an Indian child. . The term ﬁparticipantﬂ is. used. in the regulations and is meant to be very broad. . The goal is to encourage anyone, not just parties, to provide information to the court. . . Specific findings of fact regarding reasonable and ac. tive . efforts or the emergency, and . the likelihood of sustaining harm must be written after the first . numbered paragraph on this form. . . Identical findings may be made for both sections. . . Indian child. . When a court has reason to . know . a child involved in a ch. ild in need of care proceeding is . an Indian child, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) applies; notice requirements, findings and . . procedure are dictated by ICWA, an. d the ICWA forms must be used. The court ﬁhas reason to . knowﬂ a child is an Indian child if: . ﬁ (1) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the . proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the . . court that the child is an Indian child; . (2) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the . proceeding, Indian Tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the . . court that it has discovered information indicating that the child is an . . Indian child; . (3) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to . know he or she is an Indian child; . (4) The court is informed that the domicile or residence of the child, the . child™s parents, or the child™s Indian custodian is on a reservation or in . . an Alaska Native village; . (5) The court is informed that the child is or has been a w. ard of a Tribal . court; or . (6) The court is informed that either parent or the child possesses an . identification card indicating membership in an Indian Tribe. ﬂ 25 . . C. F. R. 23. 107 (c) . . 12/2018 ©KSJC . 4 In addition to the federal ICWA statutes, all federal regulations (found at. 25 C. F. R. 23) must be . followed. The court should also consult the BIA December 2016 guidelines . (www. bia. gov/bia/ois/dhs/icwa) . . . Federal Funding. If the court, in issuing this order, removes the child from the home, and if it is the first . order removing the child from the home or the first order of removal after a previously removed . . child has been home for six months or longer (as in an informal supervision) , Supreme Court . . Rule 174 requires the use of this form or another form approved by the Supreme Court . as . meeting the requirements of the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) , 42 USC § 671 . et seq. . Failure to make and properly document the findings required by ASFA will result in the loss of . . federal funding for the placement, or any subsequent placement, of . the child in the present case. . ICWA Notice of the Proceeding. . At least 10 days before the adjudication hearing, the parents, Indian custodian, and the . Indian child™s . Tribe. must receive N. otice of the proceedings (Form 210) by registered or certified . mai. l with return receipt requested. Copies of the notices. of the proceeding. must be sent via . registered or certified mail with return receipt requested to the Department of the Interior by . . serving Regional Director of the area office of the Bureau of Indian . Affairs as indicated in 25 . C. F. R. 23. 11 (b) . 25 C. F. R. 23. 11 (a) . ﬁNotice may also be sent via personal service or . . electronically, but such alternative methods do not replace the requirement for notice to be sent . . by registered or certified mail with return r. eceipt requested. ﬂ 25 C. F. R. 23. 111 (c) . If the identity . or location of the child™s parents, the child™s Indian custodian, or the Tribes in which the Indian . . child is a member of eligible for membership cannot be ascertained, but there is reason to know . . the . child is an Indian child, notice of the child. -custody proceeding must be sent to the . appropriate Bureau of Indian Affairs Regional Director. 25 C. F. R. 23. 111 (e) . . . . The Notice of the proceeding is separate from any notice of hearing requirements under . Kansa. s state law. The Notice of the proceeding must be served on all the required people at the . . beginning of a CINC case before adjudication and disposition. It must again be served on all the . . required people before the court terminates parental rights. . . An ﬁI. ndian custodianﬂ means any Indian person who has legal custody of an Indian child . under tribal law or custom or under State law or to whom temporary physical care, custody, and . . control has been transferred by the parent of such child. 25 U. S. C. 1903 (6) . . . Standard for Removal. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) requires the court to determine if active efforts. were made to prevent the removal of the Indian child from the home. . ﬁActive effortsﬂ means . . affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts intende. d primarily to maintain or reunite an . Indian child with his or her family. Where an agency is involved in the child-. custody proceeding, . active efforts must involve assisting the parent or parents or Indian custodian through the steps of . . a case plan and wit. h accessing or developing the resources necessary to satisfy the case plan. To . the maximum extent possible, active efforts should be provided in a manner consistent with the . 12/2018 ©KSJC . 5 prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the Indian child's Tribe and should be . conducted in partnership with the Indian child and the Indian child's parents, extended family . . members, Indian custodians, and Tribe. Active efforts are to be tailored to the facts and . . circumstances of the case. 25 C. F. R. 23. 2. . . An Indian child . may be. removed from the home. to prevent imminent physical damage or . harm to the child. Federal courts have determined this to include ﬁcircumstances in which the . . child is immediately threatened with harm, including when there is an immediate threat . to the . . safety of the child, when a young child is left without care or adequate supervision, or where . . there is evidence of serious ongoing abuse and the officials have reason to fear imminent . . recurrence. ﬂ BIA Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act, December 2016, . . Section C. 2. (quoting from . Hurlman v. Ric. , 927 F. 2 d 74, 80. -81 [2 d Cit. 1999] ) . . The U. S . Department of the Interior interprets the standard that removal of an Indian child ﬁis necessary to . . prevent imminent physical damage or harmﬂ a. s mirroring the constitutional standard for removal . of . any child from his or her parents without providing due process. BIA Guidelines, December . 2016, Section C. 2. . . This order may be issued upon the court™s determination that there is probable cause to . bel. ieve that the allegations in the verified application f. or protective custody are true. . K. S. A. 38. -2242 (b) (1) . . The court must find that the child is likely to sustain imminent physical damage or . harm by clear and convincing evidence rather than just by proba. ble cause. . Length . No child shall be held in protective custody for more than 72 hours (not including . Saturdays, Sundays, . legal holidays, and days on which the clerk of the court is not available) . . K. S. A. 38. -2242 (b) (2) . . A protective custody order may not. be used in conjunction with police . custody to extend the total 72 hours that a child may be in protective custody without a . . temporary custody hearing. K. S. A. 38. -2242 (b) (2) . . The time begins to run when the placement . accepts physical custody of the child wh. ile in police protective custody pursuant to K. S. A. 38. -2232 (e) . A temporary custody hearing shall take place and an order of temporary custod. y (Form . 208) shall be issued within that time frame if the child is to remain in custody beyond 72 hours. . . ﬁAny em. ergency removal or placement of an Indian child must terminate immediately . when the removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent immediate physical damage or . . harm to the child. ﬂ 25 C. F. R. 23. 113 (a) . If the threat has been removed and the child is. no longer . at risk, the State should terminate the removal, either by returning the child to the parent or . . transferring the case to Tribal jurisdiction. However, if circumstances warrant, the State may . . instead initiate a child. -custody proceeding to which the full set of ICWA protections would . apply. . BIA Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act, December 2016, Section . C. 3. . Placement. . The Court may place the child in the protective custody of a staff secure facility if the . child has been subjected to human trafficking or aggravated human trafficking, as defined in . . K. S. A. 21. -5426, and amendments thereto, or commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as . 12/2018 ©KSJC . 6 defined by K. S. A. 21. -6422, and amendments thereto, or the child committed an act which, if . committed by an adult, would constitute a violation of K. S. A. 21. -6419, and amendments thereto. . K. S. A. 38. -2242 (c) (1) (E) . The Court may place the child in the protective custody of a juvenile . crisis intervention center only after written authorization by a community mental health center. . K. S. A. 38 2242 (c) (1) (F) . . . . If the petition in the case alleges that the child is a runaway pursuant to K. S. A. 38. -2202 (d) (9) or (d) (10) , but the child has not yet been adjudicated as a runaway, then the order . . may direct that t. he child be detained in a secure facility, but not for more than 24 hours, not . . including Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. . . . If a grandparent requests custody, the form facilitates documentation required by. K. S. A. . 38 2286. , which specified requirements concerning grandparents as potential custodi. ans. . If the . court does not award custody of the child to a parent and, if a grandparent requests custody, the . . court shall give substantial consideration when evaluating what custody, visitation or residency . . arr. angements are in the best interests of the ch. ild. . Relevant factors to be considered include . wishes of the parents, child and grandparent; the extent to which the grandparent has cared for, . . nurtured and supported the child; the intent and circumstances unde. r which the child is placed . with the grandparent, including whether domestic violence is a factor and whether the child is . . placed to allow the parent to seek work or attend school; and the physical and mental health of . . all individuals involved. . . If the court awards custody of the child to the secretary then the secretary shall have the . authority to designate the placement, and the court may make placement recommendations. . If the . child is an Indian child, it is best practice to try to provide an initial placement for the child that . . meets ICWA™s (or the Tribe™s) placement preferences. This will prevent subsequent disruptions . . if the child needs to be moved to a preferred placement once a child in need of care case is . . initiated. BIA Guidelines for Implementing . the Indian Child Welfare Act, December 2016, . . Section C. 6. . . Other Orders. . While the . ex parte. protective custody order is in . effect, . the statute requires that the . secretary allow a visit between the child and parent or parents; however, the court may find t. hat . such a visit is not in the best interest of the child and may prohibit the visit, as provided in the . . form. . If the court awards custody to the secretary, the court shall provide the secretary with a . copy of any orders entered. This order shall be served on the child™s parents and any other person . . having legal custody of the child. . . . The court may enter a restraining order (Form 134) against any alleged perpetrator of . physical, sexual, mental o. r emotional abuse of the child. This form includes a provision allowing . for issuance of a restraining order pursuant to K. S. A. 38 2255 (d) (4) . </div>
