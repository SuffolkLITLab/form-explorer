Year of Birth . . A male . female. ORDER . REMOV. ING . INDIAN CHILD FROM CUSTODY OF PARENT. AND AUTHORIZING OUT OF HOME PLACE. MENT. K. S. A. 38 2244, 38 2251, 38 2255, 38 2258, 38 2259, 42 U. S. C. §671 . et seq. . and 25 U. S. C. §1901 . et seq. . Separate journal entry or order must be attached. . (Orders pertaining to more than one child must include findings specific to each . child listed i. n the caption. ) . On this day of , 20 this matter comes before the Court. . . THE COURT HEREBY FINDS. AND ORDERS. : . . 1. The Court received testimony from the following witness (s) , whom the Court finds to be a . . qualified expert witness und. er ICWA: . . . 2. Appropriate public or private agencies have made reasonable and active. efforts but have . failed to maintain the family and prevent the removal of the child from the child™s ho. me . or an emergency exists which threatens the safety of the child as follows: (. Specific findings of . fact. regarding what active efforts were provided must be written here. ) . . . AND There is clear and convincing evidence that the . child i. s likely to sustain imminent physical . damage or harm. pursuant to 25 C. F. R. 23. 113 and remaining in the home would be contrary . to the welfare of the child as follows: . (Specific findings of facts must be. written here. . Include . evidence provided by the qualifi. ed expert witness. . ) . . . . . Rev. 12/2018 ©KSJC . 2 3. The above named child shall immediately be placed in the custody . of: . , . a relative; . a person who need not be licensed. but is . approved by the child™s . Tribe. ; a youth residential facility. or a shelter facility . approved by an Indian . Tribe. or operated by an Indian organization; or . The Secretary . if th. e child is 15 years of age or younger, or 16 or 17 years of age if . the child has no identifiable parental or family resources or shows signs of . physical, mental, emotional or sexual abuse. . . 4. THE COURT FURTHER ORDERS all providers o. f services. including educational services, . treatment, education or care of the child and family, even if not specifically referred to . herein, to provide information including any and all educational records to the S. ecretary, any . entity providing services to the child and family, counsel for the parties including the county . or district attorney, appointed CASA, Citizen Review Board members, the Court, and each . other to the extent needed to ensure the safety of the child, prevent further abuse or neglect, . and. to provide appropriate treatment, care and services to the child and family. This order . encompasses and complies with the provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy . Act (20 U. S. C. 1232 g; 34 C. F. R. 99 and the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance. Portability . and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) , 45 C. F. R. 164. 512 (e) (1) . . 5. A restraining order shall be filed against. . . THE COURT FURTHER ORDERS this matter set for . . hearing . before the Court on the . day of . , 20 . , at . : . a. m. . p. m. . . IT IS SO ORDERED THIS . day of . , 20 . . . . . The court provided the parents, grandparents and/or interested parties, who were present . at this hearing and who had not previously received them, with information. al materials . pertaining to their respective rights and responsibilities in connection with the . proceedings. . Rev. 12/2018 ©KSJC . 3 Authority . K. S. A. 38 2244, 38 2251, 38 2255, 38 2258, 38 2259, 42 U. S. C. § 671 . et seq. . , 25 U. S. C. § . 1901 et seq. . , and 25 C. F. R. 23. . . Notes on Use . . Compliance with. the Indian Child Welfare Act. (. ICWA. ) . is jurisdictional. Failure to . comply with ICWA may render orders devoid of authority. . . . Form 209 is only to be used at or after adjudication. . It contains the required findings . under . the Adoption and Safe Families Act (. AFSA. ) . and ICWA for when a child is removed from . the child™s parents or Indian custodian . at or after adjudication. . Even if the child was previously . . removed from the child™s parents or Indian custodian before adjudication (i. e. by a temporary . . custody order) , t. his form . and its related findings . must be completed at adjudication. . Federal Funding. Supreme Court Rule 174 requires the use of this form or another form approved by the . Supreme Court as meeti. ng . ASFA . requirements. Failure to make and properly document the . findings required by ASFA will result in the loss of federal funding for the placement and any . . subsequent placement of the child in the present case. Federal funding is not available when the . . court finds reasonable efforts have not been made unless the court also finds the efforts were not . . required. because an emergency exists. . If . reasonable and . active efforts have not been made and . no emergency exists, a removal should not be ordered. . . . Specif. ic findings of fact regarding . the . reasonable and . active. efforts or the emergency, . and the likelihood of sustaining harm must be written after the first two paragraphs on this form. . . Identical findings may be made for both paragraphs. . . Standard for Removal. . If the court removes the child from the home, in addition to the findings related to . reasonable efforts required by ASFA and Kansas law, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) . . requires the court to determine if active efforts. were made. to prevent the removal. of the Indian . child from the home. ﬁActive effortsﬂ means affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts . . intended primarily to maintain or reunite an Indian child with his or her family. Where an agency . . is involved in the child. -custody proceeding, active efforts must involve assisting the parent or . parents or Indian custodian through the steps of a case plan and with accessing or developing the . . resources necessary to satisfy the case plan. To the maximum extent possible, active efforts . . should be provided in a manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural conditions and . . way of life of the Indian child's Tribe and should be conducted in partnership with the Indian . . child and the Indian child's parents, extended family members, Indian custodians, . and Tribe. . Active efforts are to be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the case. 25 C. F. R. 23. 2. . . Rev. 12/2018 ©KSJC . 4 ICWA also requires the court to determine. by clear and convincing evidence. that . continued custody with the child™s parents or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious . physical or e. motional damage to the child. Federal courts have determined this to include . . ﬁcircumstances in which the child is immediately threatened with harm, including when there is . . an immediate threat to the safety of the child. , when a young child is left without care or adequate . supervision, or where there is evidence of serious ongoing abuse and the officials have reason to . . fear imminent recurrence. ﬂ BIA Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act, . . December 2016, Section C. 2. (quoting from . Hurlman v. Ric. , 927 F. 2 d 74, 80 81 [2 d Cit. 1999] ) . . Qualified Expert Witness. The . court must . hear and consider the testimony of one or more expert witnes. ses. . 25 . U. S. C. § 1912. . At least one . expert witness must be qualified to ad. dress the issue of. whether . the . child™s continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious . . emotional . or physical damage to the child. At least one expert witness must be qualified to . testify on the prevailing social and cultu. ral standards of the child™s Tribe. . The same expert . witness may be able to testify to both . issues. , but sometimes multiple experts are needed. . The . expert witness cannot be the social worker regularly assigned to the child. 25 C. F. R. § 23. 122. . . Custody and . Placement. . More detailed information about the custody and placement of the child should be made . in the journal entry to which this form is attached. If the court awards custody of the child to the . . secretary then the secretary shall have the authority to designate the placement. ; however, in . future hearings, the court will be required to make rulings to find that the secretary has complied . . with the ICWA placement preferences. BIA Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child . . Welfare Act, December 2016, Section C. 6. . If the secretary already knows where the child will be . placed, the court should make findings about how the placement complies with the ICWA . . placement preferences. . The child must be placed in the least. -restrictive setting that: . (1) most appro. ximates a family, taking into consideration sibling attachment; . . (2) allows the Indian child™s special needs (if any) to be met; and . . (3) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child™s home, extended family, or siblings. . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (a) . . Unless the c. hild™s . Tribe. has established a different order of preference, preference to . placement of the child with the following people must be given, in descending order as listed . . below: . . (1) A member of the Indian child™s extended family; . . (2) A foster home that is licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child™s Tribe; . . (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non. -Indian licensing . authority; or . (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian . organization which has a program suitable to meet the child™s needs. 25 U. S. C. 1915; . . 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (b) . . Rev. 12/2018 ©KSJC . 5 The court must, where appropriate, also consider the preference of the Indian child or the Indian . child™s parent. 25 C. F. R. 23. 131 (. d) . . Other Orders. The court may enter a restraining order (Form 134) against any alleged perpetrator of . physical, sexual, mental o. r emotional abuse of the child. This form includes a provision allowing . for issuance of a restraining order pursuant to K. S. A. 38 2255 (d) (4) . </div>
