Introduction 

his  document  has  been  prepared  to  help  persons  aspiring  to  become  certified  court 
interpreters  understand  what  the  written  test  measures,  how  it  is  administered,  and  how  to 
prepare for taking the exam.  Each examinee should study this overview thoroughly in order to 
be more fully prepared for the written exam. 

he written examination is only one part of the process for becoming a certified or approved 
court  interpreter.    Passing  this  test  does  not  mean  a  person  has  become  a  “certified  court 
interpreter;”  rather,  it  means  the  examinee  has  met  one  of  several  requirements  for 
certification. 

he written test measures candidates’ knowledge of three areas central to the work of a court 
interpreter at the level of a minimally qualified court interpreter: 

.  English  Language.    To  function  as  a  professional  court  interpreter,  one  indispensable 
component  is  a  high  degree  of  proficiency  in  the  English  language.    Accordingly,  the  written 
examination  assumes  a  high  degree  of  literacy  in  the  English  language  and  familiarity  with  a 
range  of  language  constructions.    It  tests  comprehension  of  written  English  vocabulary  and 
idioms. 

.  Court-Related  Terms  and  Usage.    A  second  area  of  knowledge  essential  to  successful 
professional  performance  is  familiarity  with  the  terminology  and  procedures  of  the  court 
system.    Accordingly,  the  written  examination  also  measures  recognition  of  common  court-
related situations and vocabulary, especially in the area of criminal courts. 

.  Ethics and Professional Conduct.  The third area of knowledge required of professional court 
interpreters  encompassed  in  the  written  test  is  general  knowledge  of  standards  guiding  the 
performance of duties.  Accordingly, the written exam includes questions aimed at measuring 
candidates’ knowledge of ethical behavior and professional conduct. 

 

 
What does the test look like? 

 
The  examination  contains  135  multiple-choice  questions.    Each  question  has  four  choices, 
labeled  A,  B,  C,  and  D.    The  candidate  is  instructed  to  select  the  best  choice  and  mark  that 
choice on the answer sheet (the specific form of the answer sheet will vary by state). 

he test has two parts: 

Part I:  General Language Proficiency, and 
Part II: Court-Related Terms & Usage, and Ethics & Professional Conduct.

Within  each  part  there  are  several  sections,  each  of  which  contains  a  particular  category  of 
questions.  There are specific instructions for how to proceed at the beginning of each section.  
A complete list of the sections, including one or more sample questions for each, is provided in 
Appendix A. 
 

How will the test be scheduled-What do I need to know? 

n official of the state where you are taking the exam will notify you in writing by mail or e-mail 
a minimum of two weeks before the test date.  The notice will advise you when and where to 
report for the test and may include directions to the test site. 

rrive early.  No one will be admitted late.  There are no exceptions and no one arriving late for 

any reason will be able to take the test at that test session. 

nly small purses or wallets are allowed in the testing room.  Leave everything else at home or 
in  your  car.    Do  not  try  to  bring  briefcases,  palm  pilots,  dictionaries,  gym  bags,  cell  phones, 
calculators, paper, pens, pencils, or any other similar items into the test room as you will not be 
admitted to the test room with them.  Pencils will be provided in the test room. 

here may be a registration area where you will report and sign in.  In the testing room, there 
will  be  a  test  administration  supervisor,  and  there  may  be  another  test  proctor  present  to 
assist. 

se the restroom prior to entering the testing room.  If you ask to leave the testing room after 
the  test  has  begun,  you  will  be  instructed  to  leave  all  of  your  test  materials  with  the  test 
administration supervisor prior to leaving the room.  You may be escorted to the restroom to 
ensure  that  you  do  not  use  a  telephone  or  converse  with  other  individuals  while  you  are 
outside of the testing room.  No more than one candidate will be allowed to leave the testing 
room at the same time.  No adjustments to the time allotted for completion of the exam will be 
made for any time you are outside of the testing room. 
 

 

Special Accommodations for Americans with Disabilities 

f  you  have  a  disability  recognized  by  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA),  you  must 
request  special  accommodation  in  advance.    In  order  to  do  that,  you  should  complete  the 
attached  Request  for  Special  Accommodation  and  submit  it  to  the  director  of  the  court 
interpreting program in your state as far ahead of the test date as possible.  You must describe 
your disability and describe the type or kind of accommodation you are requesting.  In addition, 
you must submit a statement from an appropriate professional documenting the diagnosis or 
evaluation of your disability.

How will the test be administered? 

The administration protocol, described below, is recommended practice.  It is specifically noted 
here that from state to state, there may be some deviation from the exact recommendation.  
However the protocol described will, in large part, reflect administration practices. 

n most states, the test will be given in classroom style to a number of candidates at the same 
time  in the  same  room.    A  test  administration  supervisor,  who  is  responsible for  oversight  of 
the entire test administration process, will decide what staff members are present to assist with 
proctoring the examination. 

eating will be assigned.  Depending upon the seating arrangements, some candidates may be 
asked  to  move  from  one  seat  and  occupy  another.    If  this  happens,  it  is  for  test  security 
measures and the candidates should not be troubled or concerned. 

ecurity of the test materials is obviously essential.  Examinees may not take notes or copy any 
portion of the exam. 

roctors  will  monitor  candidates  throughout  the  examination  to  prevent  cheating  and,  if 
cheating occurs, detect and deal with it.  They may circulate throughout the room, but they will 
not  disturb  the  examinees.    If  a  proctor  suspects  that  an  examinee  is  cheating  in  any  way, 
including  giving  or  receiving  assistance  during  the  examination,  communicating  with  others, 
retaining  or  copying  examination  questions,  or  using  prohibited  aids,  the  proctor  will  follow 
specific protocol for addressing the situation.   

f an examinee is disruptive, engages in clear or flagrant cheating, or attempts to copy questions 
or  retain  or  record  test  materials,  the  examinee  may  be  expelled  from  the  testing  room  and 
advised that his or her examination will not be scored.  Documentation of the expulsion and the 
reasons for it will be maintained by the state. 

nce  all  examinees  are  seated  for  the  exam,  the  test  administrator  will  hand  out  materials 
packets  and  two  pencils  to  each  person.    He  or  she  will  read  scripted  instructions  to  the 
examinees  in  order  to  ensure that  all  candidates  receive  the  same  instructions  each time  the 
examination is given.  Then the examinees will be directed to read and execute an Agreement 
and Oath Form.  Next, examinees will prepare their answer sheets by entering their name and 
social  security  number,  the  test  date,  and  the  test  site.    Examinees  must  listen  to  the 
instructions  carefully  and  must  not  begin  the  examination  until  the  test  administration 
supervisor says, “You may begin.” 

andidates are allowed two hours and fifteen minutes to complete the examination.  A clock 
will  be  provided  in  each  testing  room  to  assist  candidates  who  do  not  bring  their  own

timepiece.    Fifteen  minutes  before  the  end  of  the  test,  the  test  administrator  will  make  the 
following announcement out loud:  “You have fifteen minutes remaining.” 

t the beginning of each section there are instructions on how to answer the questions in that 
section.    As  examinees  work  their  way  through  the  test,  they  should  carefully  read  the 
instructions  for  each  section  to  be  sure  they  understand  how  to  answer  that  section’s 
questions.  The types of instructions you will find will be to select the answer that: 

Is closest in meaning; 

o 
o  Most appropriately completes a sentence; 
o  Best answers a question or provides the best solution to a situation; 
o  Has the correct sequence of events; or 
o 

Is opposite in meaning. 

ee Appendix A for sample questions from the various sections of the exam. 

 

 

What is the passing score? 

n order to pass the test, 80 percent of the items must be answered correctly.  That means the 
examinee must answer at least 108 of the 135 items correctly in order to pass.  The state’s test 
administration supervisor will ordinarily advise the examinee of the results of his or her test by 
mail  or  e-mail.    Reminder:    Passing  this  test  does  not  mean  you  are  now  a  “certified”  or 
“approved” court interpreter. 

What can I do to prepare for the test? 

 list of possible activities and resources has been compiled to help you identify actions you can 
take to help prepare for the exam.  Some of the resources may help you decided whether you 
are ready to participate in a test of this nature.  The list is attached and marked as Appendix B. 

What if I don’t pass the exam? 

This written examination is constructed to measure entry-level knowledge of 

(cid:1)  English general vocabulary 
(cid:1)  common words and phrases likely to be heard in court 
(cid:1)  the typical progression of cases through the court system, and 
(cid:1)  provisions of a code of professional responsibility 

that a minimally competent person entering the court interpreting field would need.

If you do not pass the exam, it is suggested that you resist the temptation to simply register to 
retake  the  exam.    Experience  shows  that  retaking  an  examination  of  this  kind  within  a  short 
time period will not substantially change the results.  Instead, you are encouraged to review the 
section of this Overview entitled “What can I do to prepare for the test?” and Appendix B, and 
engage in some reading and preparatory study before retaking the examination. 

he  time  frame  within  which  you  can  register  to  retake  the  written  examination  varies  from 
state  to  state.    Check  with  your  state’s  interpreting  program  manager,  administrator,  or 
coordinator to find out details.  It is recommended to every state that no candidate should take 
the same test more than once in a calendar year and in no event, more than twice.

Preparing for the test 

 
If you are not familiar with taking written, multiple-choice tests, you may find it beneficial to: 
 

1.  Review instructions and suggestions on taking multiple-choice tests such as: 

a.  “Information about the Written Examination,” Federal Court Interpreter 
Certification Examination (http://www.ncsc.org/fcice/) on page 16. 

2.  Study preparation material developed for similar exams, or even take the exams 
a.  TOEFL:  (http://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/prepare/).  There are many other 

publications available as well. 

 

With respect to Part I, General Language Proficiency, one needs to have a very broad command 
of the English language.  That is not something that is quickly or easily acquired.  However, 
some of the following activities might be helpful in expanding one’s knowledge of the English 
language and preparing for the test: 
 

1.  Take upper-level English courses at a college or university. 
2.  Read widely such items as books and professional journals in many fields, American 

literature, and editorials and articles in major newspapers. 

3.  Brush up on English vocabulary and lexical concepts (go back to the basics and review 

antonyms, synonyms, and idioms). 

4.  Review sample tests from other interpreter certification programs: 

a.  Administrative Office of the United States Courts:  For a description of the 
written portion of the Federal Court Interpreter Certification Examination 
(FCICE), go to www.ncsc.org/fcice/.  A sample test can be found in the Examinee 
Handbook. 

5.  Consult other resources, such as: 

a.  The Idiom Connection, available online at: http://www.idiomconnection.com/. 
b.  The ESL Idiom Page, (Dennis Oliver), available online at: 

www.eslcafe.com/idioms. 

c.  The Synonyms Page, available online at: http://www.synonyms.net/. 
d.  SAT and GRE workbooks. 
e.  Vocabulary-building books found in the reference section of libraries and 

bookstores. 

ith respect to Part II, Court-Related Terms & Usage, and Ethics & Professional Conduct, the 

following activities would be helpful in expanding or acquiring the substantive knowledge 
pertinent to these fields: 

 
1.  Read news items related to legal matters, law enforcement, and the courts in major 

newspapers, consulting a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words. 

2.  Visit courthouses and observe court proceedings in civil, criminal, and family matters.

(http://apps.americanbar.org/abastore/index.cfm?section=Main&fm=Product.Search&t
ype=b&sgcd=&k=law+and+the+courts), which are available for $2.50 each: 

a.  Law & the Courts, Volume I, The Role of the Courts, 2000. 
b.  Law & the Courts, Volume II, Court Procedures, 1998. 
c.  Law & the Courts, Volume III, Juries, 2001. 

6.  Study legal terms from the following sources: 

a.  Black’s Law Dictionary 
b.  Glossary of Commonly Used Court & Justice System Terminology (a publication 

that is available at http://www.ncsc.org/Education-and-
Careers/~/media/Files/PDF/Education%20and%20Careers/State%20Interpreter
%20Certification/Glossary%20of%20Legal%20Terms%2010-10.ashx). 

Ethics & Professional Conduct 

1.  Become familiar your state’s Code of Professional Responsibility [or Conduct] for Court 

Interpreters and its Rules of Court pertaining to court interpreting, if any. 
2.  Study the model code of professional responsibility, which is available at 

http://www.ncsconline.org/wc/publications/Res_CtInte_ModelGuidePub.pdf. 
3.  Join and participate actively in a professional association such as the National 

Association of Judicial Interpreters and Translators (www.najit.org) or the American 
Translators Association (www.atanet.org), studying their respective codes of ethics. 

4.  Read at least one of the classic texts in the field:
