INFORMATION REGARDING ORIENTATION TRAINING PROGRAM 

Oklahoma’s  Certified  Sign  Language  Interpreter  program  is  very  new.  Rule  12,  which 
authorizes  the  Board  to  implement  this  process,  was  issued  in  September  2017.  We 
welcome your interest! 

Candidates for registration as Certified Sign Language Interpreters must attend the two- 
day Orientation Training Program.  All Oklahoma courtroom interpreters are required to 
attend this training. In these highly focused, two-day training classes, participants will be 
educated in: 

• Structure of the Oklahoma judicial system & legal terminology;
• Oklahoma’s Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in the  Oklahoma 

Courts;

• Role of the interpreter in various legal and court proceedings;
• Modes of interpretation including consecutive, simultaneous, and sight.

These  classes  are  primarily  attended  by  bilingual  individuals  who  are  interested  in 
becoming Registered Courtroom Interpreters for spoken languages. The training will be 
conducted  primarily  by  a  federally  certified  court  interpreter  who  has  many  years  of 
interpreting,  training,  and  testing  experience.  The  training  will  be  predominantly  in  the 
spoken  English  language,  with  some  other  language-specific  examples  and  terms 
explained and used.  The classes are highly interactive, which means the participants 
will  practice  various  interpreting  modes  and  techniques,  discuss  shared  challenges, 
and take part in insightful exercises designed to build court interpreting skills. 

Following  the  training,  participants  who  desire  to  become  Certified  Sign  Language 
Interpreters  must  take  and  pass  the  NCSC  Written  Exam  (General  English  Language 
Proficiency, Court-Related Terms, Ethics & Professionalism). 

Additional  information  &  study  materials  will  be  provided  after  you  register  for  the 
program.

Rules of the State Board of Examiners of Certified Courtroom Interpreters 
Oklahoma Statutes, Title 20, Chapter 23, App. II 
Rule 12 - Sign Language Interpreters 

a) The  Board  is  authorized  to  maintain  a  registry  of  courtroom  interpreters  for  the  deaf  and  hard-of-
hearing. A “Certified Sign Language Interpreter” is a sign language interpreter who has satisfied the
requirements set forth in this rule, and whose registration with the Board is current.

b) To become listed on the registry as a Certified Sign Language Interpreter, the candidate must:

1) Meet the general requirements for eligibility, as provided in Rule 3 above;

2) Complete an interpreter orientation training program as approved by the Board;

3) Pass the NCSC Court Interpreter Written Examination;

4) Agree  in  writing  to  be  bound  by  the  Code  of  Professional  Responsibility  for  Courtroom

Interpreters in Oklahoma; and

5) Prove that he or she holds at least one of the following sign language interpreting credentials:

i) SC:L,  NIC,  NIC-A,  NIC-M,  CI,  CT,  NAD  V,  and/or  CDI  certification  from  the  Registry  of

ii)

Interpreters for the Deaf (RID);
the  BEI  CIC  (the  Court  Interpreter  Certificate  from  the  Texas  Board  for  Evaluation  of
Interpreters); or

iii) a  similar  credential  which  the  Board  deems  appropriate  for  interpreting  in  the  Oklahoma

courts.

c) The applicant must prove to the satisfaction of the Board that the required sign language interpreting
credential is current and in good standing with the issuing authority and is not temporary, alternative
or conditional.

d) Renewal:

1)

Interpreters  registered  as  a  Certified  Sign  Language  Interpreters  must  renew  their  registration
with  the  Board  in  order  to  confirm  that  their  underlying  sign  language  interpreting  credential
remains in good standing. The renewal process shall be prescribed by the Board, and the Board
shall provide a renewal form through the office of the Administrative Director of the Courts. The
amount of the renewal fee shall be set by the Board, with the approval of the Supreme Court.

2) To qualify for renewal, interpreters must prove  to  the  satisfaction of  the Board that the required
sign  language  interpreting  credential  is  current  and  in  good  standing,  according  to  RID’s
Certification  Maintenance  Program,  or  the  BEI  CIC  renewal  process,  or other  credentialing
authority’s  renewal  requirements.

3)

If the interpreter fails to provide renewal information to the satisfaction  of the Board, the Board
shall  remove  the  interpreter  from  the  registry  of  Certified  Sign  Language  Interpreters.  An
interpreter who has been removed from the registry for longer than twenty-four (24) months shall
be required to repeat the requirements in paragraph (b) above, including the orientation training
and written examination, before being reinstated.

Revised 6-28-2022 

e) Satisfaction of the professional development and continuing education required to maintain the sign
language  interpreter's  underlying  RID  certification,  BEI  CIC,  or  other  credential  shall  satisfy  the
Oklahoma courtroom interpreter continuing education requirement.

f) A Certified Sign Language Interpreter whose registration with the Board is current shall be eligible to
serve as a "qualified legal interpreter" pursuant to the Oklahoma Legal Interpreter for the Deaf and
Hard-of-Hearing Act (63 O.S. §§ 2407 et seq.) and is hereby recognized as "certified" for the purposes
of 20 O.S. § 1701(A) and § 1703(E).

1) The court shall endeavor to obtain the services of a Certified Sign Language Interpreter prior to
accepting services of an interpreter with lesser certification and skill.  If a Certified Sign Language
Interpreter is not available, the  Court shall endeavor to obtain  the services  of  a  qualified  legal
interpreter  with  the  highest  available  level  of  certification,  skill  and  specialized  training,  as
enumerated in 63 O.S. §2408, prior to accepting services of an interpreter with lesser certification
and skill.

2) As provided in 20 O.S. §1710, only when good cause is shown and the court has determined that
it would not be practical, within a reasonable time frame, to secure the services of a Certified Sign
Language Interpreter, or a qualified legal interpreter as enumerated in as enumerated in 63 O.S.
§2408, for a deaf or hard-of-hearing individual, then the court may utilize the services of a person
who does not hold a "qualified legal interpreter" certification recognized in 63 O.S. §2408.

g) The Board may recommend that the Supreme Court remove a Certified Sign Language Interpreter
from the registry if the Board, in its sole discretion, determines that such action would be in the best
interest of the courts.  A complaint against a Certified Sign Language Interpreter shall be conducted
using  the  same  informal  procedures  which  apply  to  a  complaint  against  a  Provisional  Status
Interpreter, as set forth in Rule 4 of the Board’s Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings.  20 O.S.
Chap. 23, App 3.

h) The Board may recommend reinstatement of a Certified Sign Language Interpreter who has been
removed from the registry pursuant to paragraph (g) above if the Board determines that such action
would  be  in  the best interest of  the  courts and the  conditions  which  necessitated  the  interpreter’s
removal have been resolved. An interpreter who has been removed from the registry for longer than
twenty-four (24) months shall also be required to repeat the requirements  in  paragraph  (b)  above,
including the orientation training and written examination, before being reinstated.
