COURT REPORTERS AND THE LAW 
 

Each reporter should be aware of his/her individual responsibility to be familiar with the statutes 
governing Oklahoma court reporting.  The majority of the statutes can be found in Title 12 and Title 
20 of the Oklahoma Statutes.  The remainder may be found by referring to the general index of the 
Oklahoma  Statutes.    The  Oklahoma  Statutes  are  also  available  on  the  Supreme  Court  website, 
www.OSCN.net, under Legal Research.  

Forms  and  information  pertaining  to  court  reporters  are  available  in  the  Certified  Shorthand 
Reporters section of the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s website, www.OSCN.net, under Programs.  

www.oscn.net/static/forms/aoc_forms/csr.asp. 

n some counties of the state of Oklahoma, local court rules have been adopted in addition to the 
Supreme Court Rules and the District Court Rules.  All reporters should familiarize themselves with 
these local rules, if applicable.  A publication requirement for local court rules is codified at 20 O.S. 
§ 91.8, which became effective on Nov 1, 2009.  Local rules and administrative orders of a district 
court shall not conflict with any statutes of this state or any rules of a superior court. Local rules shall 
be in writing and published on the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network to be valid and enforceable.

Name of Accused), 
Respondent, 

COMPLAINT 

he  Complaint  shall  state  the  specific  facts  constituting  the  alleged  misconduct,  whether  prior 
misconduct has resulted in discipline, and whether prior investigations of misconduct are to be 
relied upon to enhance discipline. Any prior acts or conduct relied upon to enhance discipline shall 
be  so  stated  and  set  forth  by  specific  allegation  of  fact.  The  complaint  shall  be  attested  by  the 
Chairman of the Board. 

) Should the complaint allege as grounds for discipline the final conviction of a court reporter, in 
any jurisdiction, of a criminal offense which indicates a clear and rational likelihood that the court 
reporter will not properly discharge his or her duties and responsibilities as a certified shorthand 
reporter, there shall be attached thereto a certified copy of the indictment or information, and a 
certified  copy  of  the  judgment  and  sentence  on  a  plea  of  guilty,  order  deferring  judgment  and 
sentence, or judgment and sentence of conviction. Such documents, regardless of the pendency of 
an appeal, shall constitute the charge and be conclusive evidence of the commission of the crime 
upon which the judgment is based and shall suffice as the basis for discipline in accordance with 
these rules. Thereafter, the issues in a formal proceeding shall be limited to whether the conviction 
demonstrates a clear and rational likelihood that the court reporter will not properly discharge his 
or her duties and responsibilities, and the nature and extent of discipline to be imposed.  

) If an appeal is perfected from the judgment of conviction and such judgment is reversed, the 
disciplinary proceedings based on such conviction shall be dismissed immediately and the court 
reporter involved restored to his/her former status.  

) Conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to the imposition of discipline. 
Nothing  contained  herein  shall  prevent  the  Board  from  initiating  and  conducting  formal 
disciplinary  proceedings  upon  charges  identical  to  those  set  forth  in  a  criminal  complaint, 
indictment,  or  information,  notwithstanding  the  pendency  or  final  disposition  of  the  criminal 
action. 

) The Secretary of the Board shall cause the complaint together with notice of a hearing before 
the Board thereon to be sent to the court reporter involved. The hearing before the Board shall be

Chairman of the Board may, in his or her discretion, grant continuances for good cause known.1 

) Upon receipt of sufficient evidence that a court reporter has engaged in conduct indicating that 
he or she is unfit to practice court reporting, and where such conduct poses an immediate threat of 
public harm, the Board may, in its discretion, request the Supreme Court to order the immediate 
interim suspension of that court reporter. In its order of interim suspension, the Court shall direct 
the court reporter to appear before the Board at a time certain, to show cause why the order of 
interim suspension should be set aside. Upon good cause shown, the Board may request the Court 
to set aside its order of interim suspension when it appears to be in the interest of justice to do so, 
with due regard being given to maintaining the integrity of and confidence in the court reporting 
profession. 

) Upon written request made not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing date, the court 
reporter respondent shall be provided with a list of all witnesses the Board reasonably anticipates 
may  be  called  to  testify  at  the  hearing  and  copies  of  all  documentary  evidence  supporting  the 
allegations  of  the  complaint.  (These  will  be  provided  by  the  Attorney  General  or  an  Assistant 
Attorney  General,  not  less  than  ten  (10)  days  prior  to  the  hearing  date.)  The  court  reporter 
respondent, not less than five (5) days prior to the hearing, shall submit a list of all witnesses the 
respondent anticipates may be called to testify at the hearing and all documentary evidence the 
court reporter intends to introduce as evidence in defense of the charges in the complaint or as to 
mitigation of discipline. The Board may in its discretion and for good cause shown modify the 
time limits herein imposed.  

ule 7. Disciplinary Hearings.   

) The Board, under signature of the Chairman on behalf of the Board, shall have power to issue 
subpoenas  to  compel  the  attendance  of  witnesses  on  behalf  of  the  State  or  the  court  reporter 
involved.  

) The Chairman shall preside over formal disciplinary hearings and, if necessary, rule on questions 
of procedure. Disciplinary hearings shall be conducted in an orderly manner, generally following 
the order of proceedings in civil matters. However, the formal rules of evidence and civil procedure 
shall not apply to disciplinary hearings before the Board. Any evidence offered on behalf of the 
complainant  or  the  court  reporter  respondent  shall  be  received  and  considered  unless  clearly 
irrelevant to the proceedings. The court reporter shall have the right to appear personally or through 
counsel,  cross  examine  witnesses  and  present  evidence  on  his/her  own  behalf.  A  complete 
stenographic  record  of  formal  disciplinary  hearings  before  the  Board  shall  be  kept.  The 
complainant  shall  have  the  burden  of  persuasion  on  the  material  elements  of  the  complaint. 
Hearings may be adjourned or continued to a date certain as the Board in its discretion shall decide.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ETHICAL CONDUCT 

t  is  imperative  that  a  court  reporter  adhere  to  the  strictest  of  ethical  standards.    The  following 
guidelines may be helpful in this effort.  These statements do not address all possible ethical situations, 
but provide a framework for the overall ethical conduct a court reporter should exhibit. 

The reporter must take verbatim the proceedings and type the record exactly as reported.  No 
changes in the record are to be made by the reporter, although some editing will naturally 
occur.   

Be fair and impartial toward each participant in all aspects of reported proceedings.  

Always offer to provide the same services to all parties in a proceeding.   

The court reporter must keep certain court proceedings confidential.  The proceedings that 
must be kept confidential include, but are not limited to, adoptions and juvenile matters.  This 
confidentiality  extends  to  questions  by  members  of  the  public  concerning  both  court 
proceedings in general and in specific cases.   

A court reporter should possess great integrity.  Impropriety or even the appearance of such is 
to be avoided under all circumstances.  

Be alert to situations that may be a conflict of interest or may give the appearance of a conflict 
of interest.  Always disclose any conflict of interest that may arise.   

A court reporter should be punctual.  The reporter must make every effort not to delay court 
proceedings.  The reporter may occasionally be required to work irregular hours.   

The court reporter is the unbiased, impartial scribe and custodian of the official record.  It is 
the  reporter's  responsibility  to  make  certain  that  the  trust  bestowed  on  him  or  her  as  the 
custodian of a record is not misplaced.  A record that is not completely accurate and unbiased 
destroys the system of justice. 

As an official reporter, refrain from freelance reporting activities that interfere with official 
duties and obligations.   

A  court  reporter  is  a  public  servant.    As  such,  the  reporter  will  be  expected  to  deal  with 
attorneys, judges and members of the public in a courteous and cooperative manner.  

A court reporter should conform to the same standards of dress as that required for members 
of the bar.  The reporter should present a dignified and business-like appearance.  The chewing 
of gum in the courtroom is unprofessional.   

Each reporter must realize that he/she is an officer of the court and, as such, should conduct 
himself/herself in a professional manner at all times with strict adherence to the rules and 
statutes of the State.

 court reporter works in a public setting and will be viewed by the public as privy to all "inner 
workings" of the court system.  The reporter should remember that for many of the litigants and other 
persons involved in the court process this is an uncommon situation in their lives. They may not fully 
understand the nuances of the legal system.  The court reporter must make certain that his or her 
actions do not give rise to an appearance of impropriety within the court system.  It is always better 
to err on the side of discretion. 

he selling of transcripts that have not been made part of the public record to other than the litigants 
or the deponent without the agreement of the litigants and the deponent should not be done.  Once a 
transcript has been made a part of the public record, subject to any protective order or state or local 
rule to the contrary, the reporter may sell the transcript to third parties without the consent of the 
parties or the deponent. 

Because of Oklahoma's judicial selection and retention process, a District or Associate District Judge 
in Oklahoma must campaign to remain on the bench.  An official court reporter may be called on to 
support a judge's campaign.  The judge and the court reporter should review the provisions of the 
Code of Judicial Conduct, including the provisions in Cannon 4.  In short, a court reporter who works 
as a member of a judge’s staff must follow the provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct when 
campaigning for his/her judge.  Court staff must act in a manner consistent with the judge's obligations 
under the Code of Judicial Conduct.  See Cannon 2.12.   

Certain additional rules concerning a court reporter's political conduct must be observed: 

  

    1.  The reporter may not use state supplies or equipment for any political purpose; 

2.   Political activities which give the potential appearance of prejudicial conduct of the court 

reporting function must be avoided; and, 

3.   Political activities must be conducted entirely on the court reporter's own time.

All  transcripts  shall  be  neat,  clean  and  legible.    Any  transcript  filed  for  submission  to  an 
appellate court must meet the requirements of the statutes governing such appeals.   

.   Size of Type.  Transcripts must be typed no fewer than nine characters to the typed 

2.   Corrections.  All typographical errors are to be corrected so as not to be messy or 
noticeably visible.  All corrections and additions must be on the same line as the rest 
of  the  typed  line.    No  insertion  is  permitted  in  the  space  between  two  lines  of 
type.  Never write in corrections.   

 3.   Paper.  Use 8-1/2 x 11 paper.  Margins should be no more than one-half inch at the 
top, bottom and on the right side, and no more than one and one-half inch on the left, 
which will leave a proper amount of space for margin and binding.  There should be at 
least twenty-five lines to a page.  Any stapling of pages together, such as Instructions, 
should be done in the upper left-hand corner.  Please note 20 O.S. § 106.4. 

 4.   Numbering.  Each page after the cover page and ending with the certificate should be 
numbered in the upper right-hand corner.  Although cover pages are included in the 
numbering,  a  reporter  should  never  place  numbers  directly  on  these  pages.    Index 
pages may be numbered with Roman Numerals. 

  5.   Spacing.  All transcript lines, excluding title and index pages, should be no more than 
double spaced.  Cover pages and index pages should be spaced appropriately. 

  6.   Cover Page.  The first two lines of the cover page should specify the court or division 
in  which  the  proceedings  were  held  and  in  which  the  transcript  is  to  be  filed.    The 
caption includes the participants designated by party, and case number.  The pertinent 
information  as  to  the  contents  of  said  transcript  should  be  capitalized  and 
centered.  Attorneys' appearances should be listed on the cover page, unless space 
prohibits.  The reporter's appearance is listed at the bottom of the page.  The cover 
page is included in the numbering, but the page itself is not numbered.   

 7.   Appearance Page.  This will include appearances when there is not sufficient space 

on the cover page.   

 8.  

Index/Table of Contents.  The index should contain the names of the witnesses, the 
page  number(s)  where  the  testimony  occurs,  the  exhibits,  and  when  exhibits  are 
offered and/or admitted into evidence.   

  9.   Certificate Page.  The certificate page should contain the reporter's name, certificate 
number, a statement verifying that all contents are accurate and complete, and that the 
reporter is not a relative or employee or attorney or counsel of any of the parties, or a

relative or employee of the attorney or counsel, and is not financially interested in the 
action.  It should be numbered sequentially in the upper right-hand corner.   

10.  Swearing  of  Witnesses.    Although  court  reporters  have  the  authority  to  swear 
witnesses, this is usually done by the judge or the court clerk.  The reporter should 
always note this in the record and should further note whether the witness was sworn 
or affirmed. 

11.    Introduction of Witnesses.  The names of witnesses should be centered, written in 

capitals and underscored.  Please note these examples: 

called as a witness on behalf of the State/Defendant, being first duly sworn/affirmed, 
testified as follows: 

was called as a witness on behalf of the Plaintiff, after having been first duly sworn, 
and testified as follows: 

was  re-called  as  a  witness,  after  having  been  previously  duly  sworn,  and  testified 
further as follows: 

                  NAME    (witness not sworn)                 

appeared as a witness and testified as follows:

    O

12.   Re-calling of Witnesses.  When a witness is re-called to the stand, the name should 
be written and placed in the same manner as when the witness was first called and 
then to be shown as "re-called on behalf of ..." 

 13.  Types of Examination.  There are four principal appropriate types of examination of 
a witness:  direct, cross, redirect and recross.  The first examination by a party who 
calls  them  is denominated  as "Direct Examination" and  the first examination  of that 
witness  by  an opposite  party  is denominated as "Cross-Examination."   Subsequent 
examination  should  be  "Redirect"  or  "Recross"  as  the  case  may  be.    Examinations 
should be centered, written in capitals, and underscored. 

14.   Names  of  Counsel  Conducting  Examination.    The  name  of  the  lawyer  who  is 
conducting  the  examination  should  be  given  immediately  after  the  type  of 
examination.  It should be capitalized   followed by a colon.   

It is generally understood that the examination is still being conducted by the same 
lawyer until it is interrupted.  For clarification, the name of the examining counsel is 
again indicated at the point of resumption of the examination, as follows: 

                                     Q  (By Mr. Smith) 

 15.    Witness Called by Opposite Party.  When a witness is called by the opposite party 

to testify, it should be denominated in the same fashion as before. 

16.    Voir Dire Examination.  The voir dire examination, as it applies to the testimony of 
witnesses, is one conducted for the purpose of determining a witness's qualifications 
to testify.  It should be set up in colloquy unless conducted extensively, in which case, 
it  should  be  set  up  in  regular  question  and  answer  fashion.    This  type  of  voir  dire 
examination is not to be confused with voir dire of the jury. 

17.    Voir Dire Examination of the Jury.  When a jury is questioned on voir dire, it is to 
ascertain their qualifications to serve as a juror.  This should be set up in a colloquy 
format.  

18.    Transcript Format.  Questions and Answers should be indicated by the abbreviations 
"Q" and "A".  Each question and answer should begin on a new line.  The statutory 
requirements for transcripts are set forth in 20 OS. §. 106.4(b), "Each page shall be at 
least  25  lines  to  the  page  and  typed  nine  characters  per  inch  size.    Said  page  as 
mentioned herein shall be no more than double spaced, and the margin on the left side 
of the page shall be no more than one and one-half inches, and the margin on the right 
side of the page shall be no more than one-half inch from the edge of the paper.  The 
format for all transcripts shall be prescribed by the Supreme Court." 

19.   Parenthetical Recitations by Reporter.  As much as possible, remarks and recitations 
by the reporter should be made in the past tense.  (Example:  Whereupon, recess was 
had.)  The purpose of a parenthetical is to state in concise form what transpired at any 
given point in courtroom proceedings.  The reporter never uses a parenthetical remark 
except  when  necessary  to  clarify,  and  should  be  very  brief  in  any  parenthetical

    O

remark.  The reporter should refrain as much as possible from reciting conclusions.  For 
example, when the witness indicates that the distance involved is about "from here to 
there," indicated an object in the courtroom, there should be no attempt on the part of 
the reporter to estimate the distance as such would be their own conclusion.  However, 
they  may,  in  order  to  show  more  clearly  what  actually  happened,  insert  the  word 
"indicating" in parenthesis.   

20.   Colloquy.  Colloquy is an on-the-record conversational exchange between counsel 
and  the  court  or  initiated  by  the  court.    It  includes  any  remarks  not  part  of  Q  and 
A.  Colloquy begins at the second tab stop or ten (10) spaces from the Q and A symbol 
to  help  contrast  that  from  the  point  where  the  questions  and  answers  begin.    The 
speaker's  name  is  typed  in  all  caps,  followed  by  a  colon  and  two  spaces.    Typing 
continues  to  the  right-hand  margin,  and  succeeding  lines  return  to  the  left-hand 
margin.    New  paragraphs  start  after  ten  spaces,  at  the  indentation  of  the  original 
colloquy.   

21.   Testimony by Deposition (Read or Video).  Before a deposition is read into evidence 
or  a  videotaped  deposition  played  for  the  jury,  consult  with  your  judge.    There  are 
basically four options: 

1.   The reporter is absent from the courtroom. 

2.    The reporter is present in the courtroom but only reports objections, noting page 

and line where they occur. 

3.   The page and line number of objections and the court's ruling are dictated in the 
record prior to         
           or following the deposition. 

4.   The reporter is present and reports the entire deposition. 

The reporter should inquire of the attorneys in advance whether or not the deposition 
has been edited or if the deposition will be presented in its entirety. 

If presented in its entirety, it is appropriate to inquire if there are any objections to the 
reporter  being  excused  during  the  reading/playing  of  the  deposition.    Insert  a 
parenthetical in the transcript that the deposition was read to or played for the jury.  Also 
reflect on the index page where the deposition was read or played. 

There  are  two  ways  to  reflect  when  a  deposition  is  edited  by  the  attorneys.    The 
attorneys may elect to dictate into the record the page and line numbers omitted, or 
the reporter will simply report what was read and transcribe that in the record.

    O

When  transcribing  several  pages  of  a  deposition  or  previously  given  testimony 
presented at a trial, use the standard format, and Q and A symbols.  Indicate who read 
the  questions  and  answers,  and  put  a  quote  mark  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the 
quoted  material.    If  there  are  interruptions  during  the  reading,  repeat  quotation 
marks.  Reflect direct and cross-examination in the index.   

22.   Quoting  Testimony.    The  quoting  of  testimony  should  be  indicated  by  the  use  of 
quotation marks placed at the beginning and end of the quoted text.  This may occur 
when an attorney attempts to impeach witnesses through their previous testimony.   

23.   Quoting Statutes.  When statutes are quoted, they should be enclosed in quotation 

24.   Quoting Citations.  Always underscore a citation.  For example, Smith v. Jones, 444 

marks. 

P.2d 7. 

25.   Reading Back by Court Reporter.  Whenever the reporter reads back, whether it is 
only the last question or a day's proceedings, the facts should be noted in as simple, 
concise language as possible.  Please note the examples regarding parentheticals in 
the Forms and Examples section. 

26.   On-record and Off-record Discussion.  The judge or attorneys may want to hold a 
conversation at the bench in the presence but out of the hearing range of the jury to 
avoid  having  the  jury  leave  the  courtroom  an  excessive  number  of  times.    Such 
conferences may be either on the record or off the record.  A parenthetical should be 
used to indicate what transpired. 

27.   Incomplete  Sentences.    When  there  is  a  break  in  thought  by  the  speaker  or  if  a 
witness,  attorney  or  judge  is  interrupted,  that  interruption  should  be  indicated  by 
hyphens as follows:  Smith -- Jones.

Justice  to  appoint  a  shorthand  reporter  on  a  temporary  basis.  The  Chief  Justice  may  issue  a 
temporary certificate valid for not more than twelve (12) months, upon payment of a fee of Fifty

reporters; and 

. A temporary court reporter, either while so serving or after the expiration of this appointment, 
shall be required to transcribe any testimony and other proceedings taken by him and to certify 
that the transcription is true and correct. A transcript certified by a temporary court reporter shall

require any statement to be taken down by the court reporter or transcribed after being taken down, 
upon the same being shown by affidavit or other direct and competent evidence, to the Supreme 
Court, or other appellate court, shall constitute a denial of due process of law. The court reporter 
may use an electronic instrument as a supplementary device. In any trial, hearing or proceedings, 
the  judge  before  whom  the  matter  is  being  heard  may,  unless  objection  is  made  by  a  party  or 
counsel, order the proceedings electronically recorded. A trial or proceedings may proceed without 
the  necessity  of  a  court  reporter  being  present,  unless  there  is  objection  by  a  party  or  counsel. 
Provided  that  if  an  official  transcript  is  ordered  then  it  shall  be  prepared  by  the  official  court 
reporter. 

.  Upon  request  of  either  party  in  a  civil  or  criminal  case,  the  reporter  shall  transcribe  the 
proceedings in a trial or other judicial proceeding, or so much thereof as may be requested by the 
party, certify to the correctness of the transcript, and deliver the same in accordance with the rules 
of  the  Supreme  Court.  The  fee  for  an  original  transcript  shall  be  Three  Dollars  and  fifty  cents 
($3.50) per page. Two copies of the original transcript shall be furnished without additional charge. 
Each page shall be at least twenty-five lines to the page and typed no fewer than nine characters 
to the typed inch. Each page shall be no more than double spaced and the margin on the left side 
of the page shall be no more than one and one-half (1 1/2) inches and the margin on the right side 
of the page shall be no more than one-half (1/2) inch from the edge of the paper. The format for 
all transcripts shall be prescribed by the Supreme Court. The fees for making the transcript shall 
be paid in the first instance by the party requesting the transcript and shall be taxed as costs in the 
suit. 

hen the judge on his or her own motion orders a transcript of the reporter's notes, the judge may 
direct the payment of charges and the taxation of the charges as costs in such manner as the court 
deems appropriate. In a criminal action, if the defendant shall present to the judge an affidavit that 
the defendant intends in good faith to take an appeal in the case and that a transcript of the reporter's 
notes is necessary to enable the defendant to prosecute the appeal, and that he or she has not the 
means  to  pay  for  the  transcript,  the  court,  upon  finding  that  there  is  reasonable  basis  for  the 
averment,  shall  order  the  transcript  made  at  the  expense  of  the  district  court  fund.  The  format 
preparation,  delivery  and  filing  of  transcripts  to  be  used  in  civil  and  criminal  appeals  may  be 
regulated by the Supreme Court. 

. The court reporter shall file his or her records of the evidence and the proceedings taken in any 

case with the clerk of the court in which the case was tried. 

. To the extent that it does not substantially interfere with the court reporter's other official duties, 
the judge by whom a reporter is employed or to whom he or she is assigned may assign a reporter 
to secretarial or clerical duties arising out of official court operations.

where formerly a superior court was held within the same county shall be entitled to mileage only 
from the court fund of that county for necessary travel between the courthouse and the place where 
formerly a superior court was located, so long as district court sessions continue to be held at such 
place. When two or more persons use the same motor vehicle for travel required in the performance 
of their duties either as a judge or as a court reporter, only one of them shall be entitled to claim 
mileage  for  such  travel.  No  mileage  shall  be  paid  for  travel  by  a  judge  or  by  a  court  reporter 
between his place of residence and the courthouse of the district court of the county of which such

TRANSCRIPTS 

ranscripts Not On Appeal 

Records  on  appeal  have  priority;  however,  reporters  should  make  every  effort  to 
accommodate  requests  for  transcripts  not  on  appeal  and  should  prepare  these  records 
within  a  reasonable  time.    Reporters  must  consider  their  workload  and  judge  the  time 
accordingly. 

The original transcript, as in all cases, must be filed with the clerk of the court in which said 
case was tried.  The reporter should furnish the copies to the ordering party.  The number 
of copies needed should be ascertained at the time of ordering.  Two copies of the transcript 
shall be furnished the ordering party upon request.  One copy is sufficient, if that is all that 
is  requested.    The  page  rate  remains  the  same  as  if  an  original  and  two  copies  were 
ordered.  The amount of deposit is left at the discretion of the reporter. 

File any exhibits with the original transcript.  It is to the reporter's benefit to prepare a Notice 
of Filing to show receipt of filing of the transcript and exhibits. 

A. The court reporter shall make a full reporting by means of stenographic hand, steno-mask or 
machine notes, or a combination thereof, of all proceedings, including the statements of counsel 
and the court and the evidence, in trials and other judicial proceedings to which the court reporter 
is assigned by the appointing judge unless excused by the judge who is trying the case with the 
consent of the parties to the action. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize the 
certification of persons as certified shorthand reporters who rely exclusively upon the steno-mask 
for reporting judicial proceedings, except as provided by law. A refusal of the court to permit or to 
require any statement to be taken down by the court reporter or transcribed after being taken down, 
upon the same being shown by affidavit or other direct and competent evidence, to the Supreme 
Court, or other appellate court, shall constitute a denial of due process of law. The court reporter 
may use an electronic instrument as a supplementary device. In any trial, hearing or proceedings, 
the  judge  before  whom  the  matter  is  being  heard  may,  unless  objection  is  made  by  a  party  or 
counsel, order the proceedings electronically recorded. A trial or proceedings may proceed without 
the  necessity  of  a  court  reporter  being  present,  unless  there  is  objection  by  a  party  or  counsel. 
Provided  that  if  an  official  transcript  is  ordered  then  it  shall  be  prepared  by  the  official  court 
reporter. 

.  Upon  request  of  either  party  in  a  civil  or  criminal  case,  the  reporter  shall  transcribe  the 
proceedings in a trial or other judicial proceeding, or so much thereof as may be requested by the 
party, certify to the correctness of the transcript, and deliver the same in accordance with the rules 
of  the  Supreme  Court.  The  fee  for  an  original  transcript  shall  be  Three  Dollars  and  fifty  cents 
($3.50) per page. Two copies of the original transcript shall be furnished without additional charge.

the defendant intends in good faith to take an appeal in the case and that a transcript of the reporter's 
notes is necessary to enable the defendant to prosecute the appeal, and that he or she has not the 
means  to  pay  for  the  transcript,  the  court,  upon  finding  that  there  is  reasonable  basis  for  the 
averment,  shall  order  the  transcript  made  at  the  expense  of  the  district  court  fund.  The  format

to secretarial or clerical duties arising out of official court operations. 

0 O.S. §106.4a - Access of Transcripts to Indigent Defendants or District 

Attorney - Cost 
 

A transcript of the court reporter's notes, upon request and for the use of an indigent defendant or 
a district attorney, may not be charged to the court fund unless, before its preparation, the cost to 
be incurred was authorized by written judicial order. 

hen a judge authorizes or orders a transcript of the court reporter's notes of any proceeding to be 
prepared at the expense of the court fund, or where a prosecuting attorney orders such a transcript 
at public or court fund expense and the accused as an indigent is constitutionally entitled to a free 
copy  of  the  transcript,  a  reporter  shall  prepare  an  original  and  two  copies  of  the  transcript  so 
ordered and file it with the clerk of the trial court. The court reporter shall immediately notify the 
district attorney and the defendant of the date the transcript was filed. The district attorney and the 
defendant shall have access to the copies of the transcript on such terms as the  trial court may 
impose.  The  chief  judge  may  prescribe  rules  for  access  to  or  disposition  of  the  copies  of  the 
transcript.

with the clerk of the court in which the cause was tried, shall be admissible as evidence in all cases, 
of like force and effect,  as testimony taken in the cause by deposition, and subject to the same 
objection, a transcript of said notes may be incorporated into any appellate record. If any reporter 
ceases to be the official reporter of the court, and thereafter makes a transcript of the notes taken 
by him while acting as official reporter, he shall swear to the transcript as true and correct and 
when so verified, the transcript shall have the same force and effect as if certified while he was an 
official  reporter.  A  transcript  of  the  notes  of  any  reporter  of  the  State  Industrial  Court,  when 
certified or verified by such reporter who took the evidence in any hearing before such Industrial 
Court or any official thereof in any proceedings pending before such court, shall have the same 
force and effect as a transcript by a court reporter above mentioned, when such transcript is offered 
as  a  deposition  in  evidence  in  any  subsequent  trial  or  proceedings  before  any  court  of  record 
wherein the parties are the same as the parties who took part in the proceedings before the State 
Industrial  Court;  that  is,  the  same  parties  as  the  claimant  and  respondent  before  the  Industrial 
Court; provided that, if such party, who is claimant before the Industrial Court, is deceased, then

filed in the case and of proceedings and evidence adduced which are sought to be included in the 
record on appeal. An original and one copy of the designation of record shall be filed in the trial 
court. If there is designated for inclusion in the record any evidence or proceeding at a trial or 
hearing which was stenographically reported, an additional copy of the designation shall be given 
to the court reporter, and the cost of preparing the transcript shall be advanced forthwith by the 
designating party. 

The designation of record shall be made using the form prescribed by Rule 1.301, Form No. 11,or 
by the designation of record process in the OUCMS. Pleadings and other papers filed with the

court, or unless the document is specifically drawn in issue by the appeal: subpoenas, summonses, 
certificates of service, returns and acceptances of service, and procedural motions or orders (e.g.,

designation of record within such time as required by statute or rule specific for the appeal. 
When statute or rule does not specify the time to file the designation of record for such an 
appeal the designation shall be filed within such time so as to allow the filing of a counter

within ten days after the designation of record is filed. See 10 O.S. § 80 (paternity appeal); 
10A O.S. § 1-5-103 (Oklahoma Children’s Code appeal); and 10 O.S. §§ 7505-2.1, 7505-
4.1, & 7505-7.1 (Oklahoma Adoption Code appeal).  

(c)  Counter  Designation  of  Record.  All  appellees  (including  counter-appellees  and  cross-
appellees) shall file a counter designation of record in the trial court. The counter designation of 
record shall be made using the form prescribed by Rule 1.301, Form No. 11, or by completing the 
counter  designation  of  record  process  through  the  OUCMS.  If  an  appellee  does  not  order 
transcripts or record in addition to that designated by the appellant the appellee's designation of 
record shall so state on the counter designation of record form. An original and one copy of the 
counter  designation  of  record  shall  be  filed  in  the  trial  court.  If  additional  portions  of  the 
proceedings and evidence are designated, an additional copy of the designation shall be given to 
the court reporter.

    O

The appellee's (counter-appellee's, cross-appellee's) counter designation of record shall be filed in 
the trial court within 20 days after appellant's (counter-appellant's or cross-appellant's) designation 
of record is filed in the trial court. The times to file a counter designation of record in specific 
appeals are provided by Rule 1.28(b)(1), (2), and (3). A copy of the appellee's (counter-appellee's, 
cross-appellee's) counter designation of record shall be filed in the Supreme Court at the time the 
response to the petition in error is filed or at the time the counter designation of record is filed in 
the District Court, whichever occurs later. 

(d) Cost of Transcribing Trial or Proceedings. Each appellant (counter or cross-appellant) must 
timely advance the costs, including cost deposit for transcripts ordered by any party relating to the 
appeal of that appellant. The trial court may, after notice and prompt hearing for good cause shown, 
direct  parties to  pay  costs for transcript preparation in  another equitable  manner, pending  final 
allocation  of  costs  at  the  termination  of  the  appeal.  Proceedings  in  the  trial  court  regarding 
allocation of costs shall not delay the appellate proceedings.  

(e) Failure to Advance Costs Promptly. If the party required to advance costs shall fail to do so 
within a reasonable time, the trial court shall so certify to this court. Failure to pay costs required 
by this Rule shall not be good cause for an extension of time to complete the record and shall be 
ground  for  dismissal  of  the  appeal  (counter-appeal  or  cross-appeal)  or  any  other  sanction  the 
appellate court deems appropriate. 

(f) Error in Assessing Costs Reviewable. Trial court's errors in assessing costs for transcribing 
designated portions  of the record may be reviewed by the appellate court  if challenged by any 
party. Trial court decisions in assessing costs for transcribing designated portions of the record 
may be challenged by an amended petition in error and subsequent brief in the appeal. 

(g) Designation of Record by Stipulation of Parties. Instead of serving designations, the parties 
may designate the record on appeal by written stipulation. The stipulated designation of record 
may be filed conventionally or through the designation of record process of the OUCMS, and shall 
include a notation that the designation is stipulated by all parties. The stipulated designation of 
record shall be filed in the trial court within 10 days after the petition in error is filed. This time 
limit may be extended by the trial court. Where portions of the evidence must be transcribed and 
exhibits incorporated, a copy of the stipulation must be given to the court reporter and the cost of 
transcribing advanced.  

The parties may not stipulate to designate the entire trial court record. The parties may not stipulate 
to  designate  items  prohibited  by  Rule  1.28(b),  unless  the  trial  court  or  appellate  court  has 
authorized by order their inclusion in the record on appeal. 

(h) Power of Court to Order Additional Record. Nothing provided in this rule shall prevent the 
trial  court  or  an  appellate  court  from  ordering  that  any  undesignated  portions  of  the  record  be 
transcribed and from assessing the cost thereof. 

(i) Transcript Designated and Furnishing Copy of Designation to Court Reporter. Transcripts 
shall be ordered using the Designation of Record Form, or the Designation of Record document

    O

submitted through OUCMS, and a completed copy thereof shall be delivered to the court reporter 
and to every party when the designation of record is filed in the trial court. The transcripts and the 
particular trial or hearing exhibits necessary to a review of the issues briefed shall be clearly and 
separately designated on the form.  "Transcripts" includes transcripts of videotape, audiotape or 
other magnetic media. 

(j) Penalties for Designating Excessive Portions of Transcript. When this court determines on 
motion to tax costs made after the determination of the appeal but before mandate is issued that 
any  party  has  designated  for  inclusion  in  the  record  on  appeal  unnecessary  portions  of  the 
proceedings or evidence either at that party's expense or at the expense of another party, the costs 
of transcription attributable to the unnecessary portion shall be taxed against the designating party 
(or be ordered to be borne by such party). 

(k) Fees for Assembling Record and Cost of Transcribing Trial or Proceedings in a Juvenile 
Appeal.  In  an  appeal  from  a  District  Court  to  the  Oklahoma  Supreme  Court  and  involving  a 
judgment  or  order  issued  pursuant  to  Title  10  or  10A  of  the  Oklahoma  Statutes  in  paternity 
proceedings,  or  Oklahoma  Children’s  Code  proceedings,  or  Oklahoma  Adoption  Code 
proceedings,  (sometimes  referred  to  as  a  "juvenile  appeal"),  the  fee  for  preparing,  assembling, 
indexing, and transmitting the record for appellate review shall be paid in the manner provided by 
28 O.S. § 162(E). After a petition in error is filed the District Court retains jurisdiction to facilitate 
the completion of the record and allocate the costs of its preparation. Okla. Sup. Ct. R. 1.37(a); 28 
O.S.  §  162(E).  When  parental  rights  are  terminated  the  District  Court  retains  jurisdiction  to 
determine if a parent is indigent for the purpose of payment of the fee required by § 162(E) and 
payment for transcripts designated to be included in the record on appeal. M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 
U.S.  102 (1996); Okla.  Sup. Ct.  R. 1.37(a); Okla.Sup.Ct.R. 1.28(d). Alleged error in  a  District 
Court’s  order  adjudicating  indigent  status  or  in  allocating  the  costs  of  transcripts  may  be 
challenged in the original appeal by filing in the Supreme Court an amended petition in error within 
thirty (30) days of the date of the District Court’s order, or by filing in the original appeal in the 
Supreme Court a motion within thirty (30) days of the date the District Court’s order is filed in 
that court. Okla.Sup.Ct.R. 1.28(f) & 1.37(b). 

(l) Juror questionnaires.  

(A) If appellate counsel designates the questionnaire of any juror, the Clerk of the District Court 
shall transmit the sealed original questionnaire(s) to the Clerk of the Supreme Court along with 
the  rest  of  the  appellate  record.  Only  the  attorneys  of  record  on  appeal  may  view  the  juror 
questionnaires at the office of the Oklahoma Supreme Court Clerk, and attorneys shall not remove 
the juror questionnaires  from  the custody of the  Court. The attorneys of  record on appeal  may 
contact the Clerk to schedule a date and time when the questionnaires may be viewed. The sealed 
juror questionnaires may not be photocopied or removed from the Supreme Court Clerk office. 

(B) After an appeal has been decided by this Court, or the Court has denied A petition for writ of 
certiorari, the Oklahoma Supreme Court Clerk shall continue to retain all questionnaires until the 
later of (1) the expiration of time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States 
Supreme Court; or (2) the issuance of a notice of final disposition by the United States Supreme

Court. See Okla. Sup. Ct. R. 1.16 and Sup. Ct. R. 45-46. Thereafter, the Oklahoma Supreme Court 
Clerk shall destroy all originals and photocopies of juror questionnaires. 

(C) Briefs and motions  shall not  refer to  jurors by  name, but  shall use initials  or juror number 
instead. 

itle 12, Chapter 15, Appendix 1, Rule 1.33 - FORM AND CONTENTS OF 

RECORD 

(a) Duties of Clerk to Assemble Record. 

(1)  Electronic  Filing  via  OUCMS:  Provided  the  Oklahoma  Unified  Case  Management 
System (OUCMS) has been implemented in both the district and appellate court at the time 
the appeal is commenced, where any statute or court rule requires the district court clerk to 
prepare,  certify,  and  transmit  a  record  on  appeal  to  the  clerk  of  the  appellate  court,  an 
Electronic  Record  (E-Record)  transmitted  through  the  OUCMS  shall  satisfy  that 
requirement. The E-Record shall be a chronological compilation of all instruments on file 
which have been designated for inclusion in the record on appeal and all orders made in 
the  trial  court  with  respect  to  the  content  of  the  transcript  and  assessment  of  cost.  The 
instruments in the electronic record, indexed and numbered consecutively, shall be certified 
under the seal of the clerk, using the Certification and Notice of Completion of Electronic 
Record form prescribed in Rule 1.301, Form No. 12A. The record will not be re-paginated. 
Although a number will be assigned to each document in the record on appeal, the original 
internal  pagination  of  each  document  will  remain  unchanged.  The  E-Record  shall  be 
transmitted  to  the  clerk  of  the  appellate  court  at  the  same  time  as  the  Certification  and 
Notice of Completion of Electronic Record form No. 12A. All designations of record shall 
be included in the record on appeal. A copy of the appearance docket as of the date the 
record is certified shall be included in the record on appeal. For items which are not capable 
of being electronically transmitted, the court clerk must mail or deliver the non-electronic 
items to the Clerk of the Supreme Court, numbered consecutively, indexed and bound, and 
certified under the seal of the clerk. 

(2) Conventional Means: Where the OUCMS is not implemented in both the district and 
appellate court at the time the appeal is commenced, after the designations of the record 
are  made,  the  clerk  shall  promptly  assemble  in  chronological  sequence  all  of  the 
instruments on file which have been designated for inclusion in the record on appeal and 
all orders made in the trial court with respect to the content of the transcript and assessment 
of cost. The instruments, numbered consecutively, indexed and bound, shall be certified 
under  the  seal  of  the  clerk.  All  designations  of  record  shall  be  included.  A  copy  of  the 
appearance docket shall be included in the record on appeal.  

(b) Abbreviation of Record; Certified Copies of Instruments.

    O

If the items of an account or the pages attached to the pleadings be voluminous, the trial 
court  may  order  the  record  to  be  abbreviated  by  a  narrative  description  of  the  omitted 
instrument, or by omitting such instrument entirely. The trial court may direct, for good 
cause shown, that certified copies be substituted either for original instruments (or their 
portions) or for trial exhibits. 

(c) Duties of Court Reporter to File Transcripts and Assemble Exhibits, Copy of Transcript Upon 
Payment, and Duty of Appellant to Monitor Preparation. 

The  original  transcript  indexed  and  certified  as  correct  together  with  two  (2)  certified 
copies and the exhibits in the case if any shall be filed in the trial court by the court reporter. 
Transcripts shall be completed and filed in the trial court as soon as practicable after they 
have been ordered, and in any event within sufficient time to permit the court clerk to file 
the Notice of Completion of Record within six (6) months after the filing of the judgment, 
decree or order from which the appeal was taken. In district courts where the OUCMS is 
implemented,  the  court  reporter  shall  follow  any  rules  and/or  procedures  for  filing  of 
electronic transcripts which have been prescribed by the Supreme Court. 

The trial exhibits shall be indexed and incorporated into the transcript either by reference 
or  physical  attachment,  as  the  court  reporter  may  deem  advisable.  However,  only  two 
dimensional exhibits no larger than 8 1/2" x 14" may be transmitted to the Supreme Court 
with the record, except upon order of the Court. 

If any party desires a copy of a transcript for his or her sole use such party shall procure it 
from the court reporter upon payment of cost. 

If a transcript is sought to be included in the record on appeal, it shall be the responsibility 
of  the  trial  court  to  expedite  the  preparation  thereof  by  such  orders,  prospective  or 
retrospective, to assure the earliest possible completion of the record. The appellant has the 
burden of monitoring the preparation of the appellate record and seeking relief from the 
trial court for its timely completion. 

(d) Definition of Record on Appeal. 

The record on appeal shall consist only of those portions of the "entire trial court record" 
properly designated by a party to the appeal or ordered by the appellate court. The "entire 
trial  court  record"  shall  consist  of  all  papers  and  exhibits  filed  in  the  trial  court,  the 
reporter's notes and transcripts of proceedings, and the entries on the appearance docket in 
the office of the trial court clerk. A copy of the appearance docket shall be included in the 
record on appeal. 

Only  papers  filed  and  exhibits  presented  to  the  trial  court  together  with  transcripts 
necessary to the appeal may be included in the record on appeal. 

(e) Access to the Record by Parties or Counsel.

access to the transcript and to the bound instruments on file in the trial court on such terms 
as that court may impose. 

(f) Access to the Record by Parties or Counsel in Custody/Visitation Disputes. 

When a parent intends to appeal a custody or visitation determination and the trial court 
has previously held an in camera interview with the child or children, and a transcript of 
the proceeding was taken either by order of the trial court or by request of the parties, the 
transcript shall be provided the parties upon request and payment of costs. If no appeal is 
taken,  it  is  within  the  trial  court's  discretion  whether  to  allow  the  parties  access  to  the 
transcripts.

record on review, it shall be the responsibility of the trial court to expedite the preparation thereof 
by such orders, prospective or retrospective, in effect as may seem proper to assure the earliest 
possible completion of the record. 

(c) Driver's License Appeals.

FILING THE TRANSCRIPT - CIVIL APPEALS 

An  original  transcript,  indexed  and  certified  as  correct,  together  with  two  copies  of  the 
transcript should be filed in the trial court by the court reporter.  Exhibits are filed with the 
original transcript.  There should be prepared an original and one copy of a Notice of Filing 
for the clerk to sign.  This notice should contain: 

  

1.   The style of the case; 

2.   The date the reporter filed the transcript; 

3.   How many copies were filed; 

4.   How many pages were contained therein; 

5.   Whether any exhibits and/or written questions from the jury were filed with 

the appeal, and where they are contained; and, 

6.    A signature line for the court reporter and a signature line for the clerk to 

verify receipt of same. 

List the exhibits and questions from the jury to be filed in the Notice of Filing.  Indicate where 
they are filed, such as in a manila envelope, in the original transcript, etc.  If exhibits are too 
numerous to be stored in a single envelope or container, make a separate list as part of the 
Notice of Filing, indicating where they are contained. 

For protection, every time a reporter files a transcript, whether it is on appeal or not, it is wise 
to prepare and file a Notice of Filing or a receipt and keep a copy in the reporter's records.  If, 
by some mistake, the transcript should be misplaced, this is proof that the transcript has 
been prepared and filed. 

The reporter should file the original of this notice with the Court Clerk and retain a copy.  The 
reporter should also have the clerk sign his/her copy as well. 

Copies for Counsel 

An original and two copies of the transcripts and the exhibits of any appeal are always filed 
with  the  Court  Clerk.    Attorneys  may  then  withdraw  a  copy  of  the  transcript  with  the 
permission of the trial court.   

Rule 1.33 of the Rules of the Oklahoma Supreme Court states: 

(c)  The  original  transcript  indexed  and  certified  as  correct  together  with  two  (2) 
certified copies and the exhibits in the case if any shall be filed in the trial court

by the court reporter.  . . .  If any party desires a copy of a transcript for his or her 
sole use such party shall procure it from the court reporter upon payment of cost. 

Rule 1.33 further states: 

 (e)   Access to the record by parties or counsel.  Until a uniform rule of procedure has 
been promulgated by this court, the parties shall have access to the transcript… on 
file in the trial court on such terms as that court may impose. 

Under no circumstances should a transcript for appeal be released to anyone other than the 
Court Clerk.  When a transcript is completed, it is the reporter's duty to notify counsel of its 
completion and the amount due and owing.  Never file any transcript before it is paid in full 
except in indigent cases.

CIVIL EXHIBITS 

In the  District Courts  of  Oklahoma, the  court reporter  is  responsible for the  marking and 
maintaining of exhibits until such time as they are filed with the court clerk or released to the 
submitting party. 

Rule 1.33 (c) of the Oklahoma Supreme Court Rules, entitled “Duties of Court Reporter to 
File Transcripts and to Assemble Exhibits, Copy of Transcript Upon Payment, and Duty of 
Appellant to Monitor Preparation” reads, in part, as follows:  " ... The trial exhibits shall be 
indexed and incorporated into the transcript either by reference or physical attachment, as 
the court reporter may deem advisable.  However, only two dimensional exhibits no larger 
than 8 1/2 x 14" may be transmitted to the Supreme Court with the record, except upon 
order of the Court.”  

In addition to keeping track of exhibits in the courtroom, the reporter will retain control of the 
exhibits, whether admitted or not admitted.  At the conclusion of a day's proceedings, all 
exhibits should be in the custody of the reporter.  Exhibits excluded from evidence by the 
court  may  raise  an  important  issue  on  appeal  and,  therefore,  they  should  likewise  be 
retained, unless agreed by all parties that said exhibits may be withdrawn. 

Upon conclusion of civil proceedings, exhibits are to be maintained in an orderly fashion, 
either chronologically or by case number.  An exhibit information sheet should be kept with 
the exhibit file.  If any exhibit is filed separately, due to size or volume, it must be clearly 
marked with its exhibit number, the case style, the date and the reporter's name.  Make a 
note on the exhibit information sheet as to the location of same in order that it may be easily 
located. 

Exhibits introduced in civil proceedings are not to be released to private individuals without 
order of the court.  If the exhibits are not to be included as part of an appeal, the reporter 
may return the exhibits to the respective parties via their attorneys.  The attorney should 
sign a receipt before receiving exhibits.   Court reporters should consult with their submitting 
party.  If the appeal time has not expired, always request an order signed by a judge allowing 
for the release of exhibits.  Keep a copy of the release and/or order in the exhibit file. 

Filing exhibits.  When exhibits are few in number and not of voluminous or unwieldy size, 
they should be physically attached to the original transcript. 

If the exhibits are too numerous to be filed in the original transcript, they shall be placed in 
a manila envelope, with the case style and exhibit contents listed on the front. 

When a transcript is filed with the court clerk, regardless of whether or not it is on appeal, 
file  all  exhibits  or  photographs  of  exhibits  in  the  case,  even  though  some  may  not  be 
admitted nor designated.  They may be an important issue on appeal or further proceedings 
in the case.  Information as to the filing of exhibits should be included in the Notice of Filing.

    O

The court reporter must document when exhibits leave his or her custody.  When exhibits 
are withdrawn, a copy of the receipt should be kept in the exhibit file.  When exhibits are 
filed with the court clerk, the filing should be documented on your information sheet.  If a 
case is settled, the exhibits may be returned to the counsel for the parties. 

In the Workers' Compensation Court, the reporter is not involved in the custody and 
maintenance of exhibits, as they are marked by the court at the time of trial and 
maintained in the court file. 

EXTENSION OF CIVIL APPEAL TIME 

When the last day of the appeal period falls on a day when the clerk's office is not open for 
the performance of public business, the appeal may be filed on the next day that the clerk's 
office is open for the performance of public business.  (Rule 1.3 of the Oklahoma Supreme 
Court Rules) 

 The provisions of Rule 1.34 of the Oklahoma Supreme Court Rules govern the procedures 
required for the extension of time for the completion of record.  It may become necessary 
for the reporter to prepare an affidavit for extension of appeal time in certain instances.  For 
example: 

 

1.   An attorney did not serve the reporter in a timely fashion with a Designation 

2.      No deposit or late deposit provided to the reporter, therefore no transcript  

of Record; 

prepared, or; 

3.      Extraordinary reporter workload. 

Oklahoma Supreme Court Rules.  Article Part II. Appeals From 
Judgment Or Final Order Of The District Court 
 

RULE 1.34 - TIME FOR COMPLETION OF RECORD 

 

(g) Extension of Date for Completion of Record. The appealing party, whether an appellant, 
counter or cross-appellant, bears responsibility to ensure timely preparation of an adequate record 
to  review  the  issues  urged  by  that  party.  The  appealing  party  must  timely  order  and  pay  for 
transcripts,  designate  record,  monitor  proper  completion  in  the  trial  court,  and  request  any

    O

extensions of time if necessary for the performance of duties of the court reporter or district court 
clerk. 

To obtain an extension of time to file the Notice of Completion of Record in the Supreme Court 
the  appellant  must  file  a  motion  for  extension  of  time  prior  to  the  due  date  of  the  Notice  of 
Completion of Record. A court reporter or court clerk may not file a motion for extension of time 
to file the Notice of Completion of Record. 

The appellant's motion for extension of time must show good cause for the extension. Good cause 
for the delay in completing the transcripts or compiling the record shall be shown by attachment 
of an affidavit of the court reporter or court clerk, as applicable. No more than one thirty (30) day 
extension of time shall be  granted to  file a Notice of Completion of Record. The motion  must 
comply with Rule 1.6. 

t is important that the reporter prepare his/her own affidavit.  Be cautious of signing affidavits 
prepared by another party that may incorrectly state the reason for the extension.   

Provide  the  attorney  with  the  affidavit  and  keep  a  file  copy.    The  attorney  will  file  his 
Application\Motion for Extension of time and the reporter's affidavit.  The attorney should 
then notify the reporter if and when an extension is granted and the length of time allowed. 

CRIMINAL APPEALS 

otice of Appeal 

The  defendant  must,  within  ten  (10)  days  from  the  date  the  Judgment  and  Sentence  is 
imposed, or an order grants the appeal out of time, file with the trial court clerk a Notice of 
Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record.  A certified copy of the document is filed with 
the Clerk of the Court of Criminal Appeals.  A copy of the Designation of Record is served 
on the trial judge and the district attorney.  An additional copy is served on and receipt is 
acknowledged  by  the  court  reporter  at  the  time  of  filing  or  immediately  thereafter.  The 
designation  of  record  for  the  transcript  of  evidence  must  specify  that  part  of  the  record 
transcribed by  the  court  reporter  is  to be  included  in  the original  record on  appeal.   The 
defendant must specifically state in the designation that he requests the entire record be 
included, if that is his wish.  In capital cases, the voir dire must be included.  (see 22 O.S., 
Chap. 18, App., Rule 2.5) 

The  court  reporter  and  counsel,  at  the  time  the  designation  of  record  is  served  on  the 
reporter, should make arrangements for the payment of costs, unless the appeal is at public 
expense.  If the appealing party's designation of record does not specify the entire record,

then the opposing party or the trial judge has thirty (30) days after being served with the brief

itle 22, Chapter 18, Appendix, Rule 1.15 - Use of Court Reporter's 

Transcripts and Recordings by Appellate Indigent Defender 

  
In order to expedite the criminal appeal process and to prevent unnecessary expense to local court 
funds, in indigent criminal appeals assigned to an appellate indigent defender in accordance with 
Section 1051 of Title 22, the following provisions are made:  

. When the court reporter transcribes the trial transcript of testimony for an indigent defendant, 
an original and two (2) copies (original and three (3) copies in capital cases) are to be filed in the 
trial court clerk's office in accordance with Rule 3.2 (C).  

. An appellate indigent defender is required to review the statement of appealable issues attached 
as Exhibit B to the notice of intent to appeal and discuss the viability of issues for appeal with trial 
counsel prior to filing a supplemental designation of record, if supplementation is required. Any 
supplemental designation of record shall set forth why the additional record is required and include 
only  those  portions  of  the  record  necessary  to  address  the  propositions  to  be  raised.  Any 
supplemental  designation  of  record  shall  include  a  signed  acknowledgement  of  receipt  of  the 
additional  designation  from  each  court  reporter  responsible  for  preparing  the  record.  The 
acknowledgement may be part of the designation of record filed or a signed certified mail return 
receipt card acknowledged by the reporter with an affidavit of mailing executed by the attorney 
requesting the additional record attached to it. 

. In the event some portion of the trial proceeding was not transcribed and was not included in 
trial counsel's designation of record and the appellate indigent defender feels that portion should 
be  provided,  as  an  alternative,  the  court  reporter  may  make  available  to  the  appellate  indigent 
defender the electronic recording, or a copy of that recording. The appellate indigent defender may 
review it to determine what portion of the record should be transcribed. 

.  In  the  event  partial  transcripts  have  been  prepared  during  trial,  at  the  time  Judgment  and 
Sentence  is  imposed  those  transcripts  must  be  filed  with  the  trial  court  clerk,  together  with  all 
transcripts of pre-trial motions and preliminary hearings. See Rule 3.2( E).

by Sections 952 and 953 of Title 22, and in the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Sections 1080 
through 1089 of Title 22. 

1)  In  the  event  a  motion  for  new  trial  based  on  newly  discovered  evidence  is  filed  after  the 
Judgment and Sentence is pronounced by the trial court, but before an appeal has been perfected 
by the filing of the Petition in Error in this Court, the motion must be filed with the clerk of the 
District Court, accompanied by affidavits in support, and a copy must be served on the trial judge 
and the district attorney. The motion shall also request a hearing date be set within twenty (20) 
days, with postponement only at the trial judge's discretion. If the motion has not been ruled on 
within  the  time  in  which  an  appeal  has  been  perfected  to  this  Court,  the  trial  court  shall  have 
continuing jurisdiction to rule on the motion, but in no event shall the ruling be delayed more than 
thirty (30) days after the appeal has been perfected. The filing of the motion in the trial court shall 
not stay proceedings or absolve the defendant from the duty to file the appeal in this Court within 
the time provided by law.  

2) PROVIDED HOWEVER, if the motion for new trial is filed within ten (10) days of the date 
the Judgment and Sentence is imposed in open court, the filing of the Notice of Intent to Appeal 
and Designation of Record (Form 13.4) shall be stayed until the trial court rules on the pending 
motion. If a motion for new trial is filed within ten (10) days from the imposition of Judgment and 
Sentence in open court, the trial court shall hold a hearing on the motion and enter its order granting 
or denying the motion within thirty (30) days from the date the motion is filed. If the motion is 
denied, the defendant  shall then file, within ten (10) days of the order denying the motion,  the 
Notice of Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record pursuant to Rule 2.1 (B). If the trial court 
fails to hold the hearing within thirty (30) days, the defendant may seek extraordinary relief with 
this Court. See Section 1054.1 of Title 22 and Steffey v. State, 916 P.2d 263 (Okl.Cr.1996).  

3)  If  a  motion  for  a  new  trial  on  newly  discovered  evidence  is  filed  after  an  appeal  has  been 
perfected in this Court and prior to the expiration of one (1) year from the date that the Judgment 
and Sentence is pronounced, the motion shall be filed with the Clerk of this Court. See Section 953 
of Title 22. The motion  shall contain all the allegations required in  the trial  court and must be 
accompanied by affidavits and a supporting brief at the time of filing. This Court may dispose of 
the motion on the pleadings and the accompanying affidavits of the respective parties, by separate 
order or in the opinion on the appeal, may direct a response, or may remand for an evidentiary

hearing in the trial court; PROVIDED HOWEVER, no motion may be filed in this Court after a 
decision has been rendered and the mandate is issued.  

4) If the appeal has been decided, the opinion has been rendered and the mandate has been issued 
by this Court, then in all other cases of newly discovered evidence, a petitioner must proceed under 
the provisions of the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Sections 1080 to 1089of Title 22.  

. Commencement of Appeal. An appeal is commenced by the trial counsel's filing with the trial 
court a written notice of intent to appeal and a designation of record as prescribed in Rule 1.14 (C) 
within ten (10) days from the date the Judgment and Sentence is imposed in open court. The filing 
of the Notice of Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record in the District Court is jurisdictional 
and failure to timely file constitutes waiver of the right to appeal. A certified copy of the Notice of 
Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record shall also be filed by trial counsel with the Clerk of 
this Court within ten (10) days from the date the Notice is filed in the trial court. See Rule 2.5 and 
Form 13.4. In addition to the above notice and designation of record, the attorney of record shall 
submit to the Clerk of this Court either the appropriate filing fee, pauper's affidavit or the trial 
court's determination of indigency for the appeal filed. The Clerk of this Court shall then issue a 
Certificate of Appeal, containing the due date for filing of the Petition in Error and the Original 
Record together with the Transcripts of the Trial Proceedings.  

1) A motion for new trial is not required in order to commence an appeal in this Court. See Section 
1054.1 of Title 22.  

2) The notice of intent to appeal must include specific authority under which the party seeks to 
perfect the appeal.  

3) Any supplemental designation of record pursuant to Section 1362 of Title 22 must be filed, 
with  acknowledgement  of  service  on  court  reporters,  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  date  of 
appointment. See Rule 1.15(B). Otherwise any request to supplement the record shall be pursuant 
to Rule 3.11.  

4)  The  Judgment  and  Sentence  shall  be  in  the  form  prescribed  in  Section  XIII,  Form  13.8; 
appropriate addenda may be added as attachments to address local requirements. The trial courts 
shall develop and utilize an Order Deferring Imposition of Judgment when judgment is deferred 
pursuant to Section 991c of Title 22. In addition, the trial court shall develop and utilize an Order 
of  Revocation  of  Suspended  Sentence  pursuant  to  Section  991b  of  Title  22.  PROVIDED 
HOWEVER, when a sentence of death is imposed, the District Court shall utilize a Judgment and 
Sentence which incorporates the death warrant; and in fish and game violations and motor vehicle 
traffic cases prosecuted by Uniform Citation Complaint, the Judgment and Sentence may be set 
forth on the abstract of the court's action contained on the Uniform Citation Complaint Form or 
other form approved by the District Court.  

.  Filing  of  Appeal  Records.  The  records  for  appeal  in  all  misdemeanor  and  felony  cases, 
including the petition in error, must be filed with the Clerk of this Court within ninety (90) days

from the date the Judgment and Sentence is imposed. See Section 1054 of Title 22 . See Rule 7.3(C) 
for time requirements  in  juvenile cases and Rule 9.2(B) for time requirements in  capital  cases. 
Excluding the Notice of Intent to Appeal and the Designation of Record, which must be filed by 
trial counsel within ten (10) days after Judgment and Sentence is imposed, appellate counsel is 
responsible to ensure all records necessary to complete the appeal are filed. Where the transcript 
cannot be completed and filed within the time provided for filing appeals, the appellant must file 
his petition in error within ninety (90) days from the date the Judgment and Sentence is imposed 
and then proceed in accordance with Rule 3.2(C)(2). 

. Appeals by the State. The State must give notice in open court of the intent to appeal, and must 
state the specific authority under which the appeal will be taken in the written notice which must 
be filed in the trial court within ten (10) days of the District Court's order sought to be appealed. 
See Rule 1.2(A)(3). The prosecutor shall also file with the trial court clerk a written notice of intent 
to appeal and a designation of record as prescribed in Rule 1.14 (C) within ten (10) days from the 
date the Judgment and Sentence is imposed or the order being appealed is entered. The filing of 
the notice of Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record in the District Court is jurisdictional and 
failure to timely file constitutes waiver of the right to appeal. A certified copy of the Notice of 
Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record shall also be filed by the prosecutor with the Clerk of 
this Court within ten (10) days from the date the Notice is filed in the Trial Court. See Rule 2.5 
and Form 13.4.  

.  Appeal  Out  Of  Time.  (1)  General  Procedures  for  Obtaining  an  Out-of-Time  Appeal.  If 
petitioner  seeks  an  appeal  out  of  time,  the  proper  procedure  is  to  file  an  Application  for  Post-
Conviction Relief requesting an appeal out of time. The Application must be filed in the trial court 
where the judgment and sentence on conviction or the final order denying relief was imposed. A 
petitioner’s right  to  appeal  is  dependent  upon the ability to  prove he/she  was denied  an appeal 
through no fault of his/her own. See Blades v. State, 2005 OK CR 1 , 107 P.3d 607; see also Smith 
v. State, 1980 OK CR 43, 611 P.2d 276. If the trial court recommends an appeal out of time, then 
petitioner shall file a petition for an appeal out of time in this Court within thirty (30) days of the 
trial  court’s  ruling.  The  petitioner  must  attach  to  the  petition  a  copy  of  the  post-conviction 
application for the out-of-time appeal that was filed in the trial court and a certified copy of the 
trial court’s ruling upon that application. This Court will consider the trial court’s recommendation 
and issue an order granting or denying an appeal out of time. If the trial court denies the request, 
then Petitioner should attach a certified copy of the order denying relief to the petition for appeal 
to this Court and shall otherwise comply with those procedures for perfecting a post-conviction 
appeal. See Section V of this Court’s Rules. 

2) Out-of-Time Direct Appeals. When an appeal out of time is granted by this Court in a direct 
appeal, a Notice of Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record in the form prescribed by Rule 
1.14(C), and as set forth in Section XIII, Form 13.4, shall be filed with the clerk of the trial court 
and the Clerk of this Court within ten (10) days of the date of this Court’s order allowing an appeal 
out  of  time.  The  procedure  set  forth  in  Sections  II  and  III  of  this  Court’s  Rules  shall  then  be 
followed. The clerk of the trial court shall timely file a Notice of Completion or Non-Completion

as set out in Rule 2.3. If the appeal record is already on file with the Court of Criminal Appeals, 
this should be noted in the Notice of Completion or Non-Completion. 

3) Out-of-Time Post-Conviction Appeals. When this Court grants an appeal out of time from a 
final judgment entered under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, the documents required to be 
filed in this Court for perfecting that post-conviction appeal shall be filed by the petitioner within 
thirty (30) days of the order granting an appeal out of time in accordance with Rule 5.2(C). 

4) Out of Time Certiorari Appeals. When an appeal out of time is granted by this Court for a 
certiorari appeal arising from a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, an Application to Withdraw the 
Plea must be filed with the clerk of the trial court within ten (10) days from the date of this Court’s 
order with a request for evidentiary hearing pursuant to Rule 4.2; provided however, if prior to the 
request for the out of time appeal, the defendant timely filed an application to withdraw the plea 
and  received  a  decision  thereon,  then  the  defendant  will  file  a  Notice  of  Intent  to  Appeal  and 
Designation of Record within ten (10) days from the date of this Court’s order granting an appeal 
out of time. 

itle 22, Chapter 18, Appendix, Rule 2.2 - Form and Contents of Record  

. Duties of Clerk to Assemble Record. After a designation of the record is made, the trial court 
clerk shall promptly assemble, in chronological sequence, all of the instruments on file, together 
with transcripts as required by subpart B of this Rule, which have been designated for inclusion in 
the record on appeal. The instruments, numbered consecutively, indexed and bound in volumes 
which shall not exceed two hundred (200) pages each, shall be certified under the seal of the clerk 
of the trial court. All designations of record and a certified copy of all the appearance docket sheets, 
as well as the Judgment and Sentence AND/OR final order, shall be included. In accordance with 
Rule 3.2, three (3) certified copies shall be prepared for transmission to this Court and appellant's 
attorney. The Court recognizes the provisions of Section 1054 of Title 22 , but directs the clerk of 
the trial court to retain the original record in the trial court. See Rule 4.3 for duties in certiorari 
appeals. 

B. Duties of Court Reporter to Assemble Exhibits.  

(1) The court reporter shall ensure trial exhibits are indexed and incorporated into 
the transcript by physical attachment. In the event the exhibit cannot be physically 
attached,  the  court  reporter  shall  attach  a  clear  and  viewable  photograph  or 
photocopy  accurately  depicting  the  exhibit  to  both  the  original  transcript  (or 
separate volume if necessary) and copies as required below. All copies of exhibits, 
including photographs, provided pursuant to this Rule shall be in color unless the 
original  exhibit  was  in  black  and  white.  Black  and  white  photocopies  of  color 
exhibits  are  not  acceptable.  If  the  exhibit  is  an  audio  or  video  tape  or  other

that the original and two (2) copies of the item are filed with the transcripts. In each 
instance,  as  a  condition  to  the  admissibility  of  the  exhibit  for  consideration  on 
appeal,  the  trial  court  shall  ensure  the  party  introducing  the  exhibit  shall  be 
responsible for both its reproduction in the same quality as the original, including 
delivery to the court reporter, and the cost of reproduction. If a party fails to comply 
with a reporter's request to provide copies of exhibits in accordance with this Rule, 
the  court  reporter,  after  completion  of  the  transcripts,  shall  file  a  notice  of  non-
completion with the clerk of the District Court and the Clerk of this Court setting 
out with specificity the items that have not been provided, when the request was 
made and the party who has failed to comply with this Rule..  

(2) The original transcript, indexed and certified as correct, together with two (2) 
certified copies (original and three (3) certified copies in capital cases), and attached 
exhibits or photos or copies of exhibits, in volumes not to exceed three hundred 
(300) pages of text per volume, shall be filed with the court clerk in the trial court 
by the court reporter within sufficient time to allow the trial court clerk to file the 
notice required by Rule 2.3(A) within ninety (90) days of Judgment and Sentence

appeals.  

(3) Upon the filing of the transcript, the court reporter is required to notify in writing 
the  defendant's  appellate  attorney,  the  district  attorney,  the  attorney  general,  the 
trial court clerk and the Clerk of this Court that the transcripts have been filed with 
the  trial  court  clerk.  This  notice  shall  be  specific,  itemizing  and  describing  with 
particularity all transcripts (by volume number or date of hearing) and exhibits (by 
number/letter  and  description)  filed  with  the  court  clerk.  If  more  than  one  court 
reporter  was  involved  in  the  proceedings  at  issue,  each  court  reporter  shall  be 
responsible for filing a separate specific, itemized list. The clerk of the trial court 
shall file the notice with the record.  

(4) No exhibits  other than documentary, photographic or electronically recorded 
evidence, as required by subpart (B)(1) of this Rule, shall be incorporated into the 
record  on  appeal  or  transmitted  to  the  Clerk  of  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals; 
PROVIDED HOWEVER, this Court may direct supplementation of the record for 
any exhibit necessary for the determination of the appeal. Under no circumstances 
will controlled or dangerous substances, weapons, or ammunition, or body fluids 
or tissues be included in the record.  

C. Transcript Not Available. If no transcript has been previously prepared and no tape recording 
is  available for any portion of the trial  proceedings, the trial  attorneys may  stipulate or submit

D. Transcript Available. The transcript prepared by the court reporter shall constitute the record 
of the proceedings from which it was transcribed. When such transcript is made, tape recordings 
made by the court reporter as a supplementary backup to the stenographic record to the completed 
transcript of proceedings shall not constitute a part of the official record unless such proceedings 
were recorded in accordance with Section 1223.1 of Title 22 . See Sections 106.4(a), 106.4a, and 
106.5 of Title 20. This Rule does not preclude findings of extreme necessity by the trial court that 
such recordings, if they exist, are necessary to supplement inadequate transcripts. 

E. Form of Certification for Original Record in Trial Court. The original record to be filed in 
this Court must be certified by the clerk of the trial court utilizing the form set out in Section XIII,

G. When the Record Includes Child Pornography. When the record includes exhibits which 
depict  or  contain  child  pornography  (See  Section  1024.1  of  Title  21),  the  trial  court  shall  take 
precautionary  steps  in  the  handling  of  such  exhibits.  An  exhibit  depicting  or  containing  child 
pornography may only be possessed by the court, the court clerk, the district attorney, an assistant 
district attorney, and law enforcement.  

(1)  An  exhibit  depicting  or  containing  child  pornography  shall  not  be  copied,  duplicated,  or 
reproduced in any manner. The condition to admissibility requiring the party introducing an exhibit 
to be responsible for delivering copies to the court reporter in Subsection B, above, shall not apply 
to an exhibit depicting or containing child pornography.  

(2)  The  trial  court  shall  enter  an  order  sealing  any  exhibit  introduced  at  trial  which  depicts  or 
contains child pornography in accordance with Section 24A.29(A)(3) of Title 51. The trial court 
clerk shall take possession of the sealed exhibit and secure it in a locked, secured repository with 
access only as directed by the trial court and this Court.  

(3) An exhibit depicting or containing child pornography shall not be transmitted with the record. 
Upon  receipt  of  the  Notice  to  Transmit,  the  District  Court  shall  enter  an  Order  to  Transport

under seal with two (2) copies of the Order to Transport and hand-deliver both the sealed exhibit 
and  the  copies  of  the  Order  to  Transport  to  the  Clerk  of  this  Court.  Any  exhibit  depicting  or

proper chain-of-custody of the exhibit until hand-delivered to the Clerk of this Court with two (2) 
copies of the Order to Transport. The individual shall return one copy of the District Court's Order 
to Transport with the Clerk of this Court's acknowledgment of receipt to the trial court clerk.  

(5) Upon receipt of a sealed exhibit depicting or containing child pornography, the Clerk of this Court 
shall acknowledge receipt of the exhibit on one (1) copy of the District Court's Order to Transport 
and file one (1) copy of the Order to Transport. The clerk of this Court shall enter the exhibit on the 
case docket and secure the exhibit in a locked, secured repository with access only as directed by this 
Court. Counsel for Appellant and for the State may contact the Marshal of this Court for viewing of 
any exhibit depicting or containing child pornography. When an exhibit depicting or containing child 
pornography is no longer needed for judicial review, this Court will order destruction of the exhibit. 

Important!  Note that paragraph G above contains specific provisions regarding 
exhibits which depict or contain child pornography. 

.  Ten-Day  Requirement.  Within  ten  (10)  days  from  the  date  the  Judgment  and  Sentence  is 
imposed in open court or an order grants an appeal out of time, the defendant must file with the 
trial court clerk a notice of intent to appeal and designation of record in the form prescribed in 
Rule 1.14 (C). The filing of the Notice of Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record in the District 
Court is jurisdictional and failure to timely file constitutes waiver of the right to appeal. A certified 
copy of the Notice of Intent to Appeal and Designation of Record shall also be filed by trial counsel 
with the Clerk of this Court within ten (10) days from the date the Notice is filed in the trial court. 
A copy of the designation of record must be served on the trial judge and the district attorney or, 
if an appeal from a municipal court of record, the municipal attorney. An additional copy must be 
served on, and receipt acknowledged by, the court reporter at the time of filing or immediately 
thereafter. See Rule 2.1(B) and Form 13.4. 
 

(1)  Original  Record.  The  designation  of  the  original  record  shall  specify  those 
records filed in the trial court which are to be included in the original record for 
appeal. The Judgment and Sentence MUST BE INCLUDED in the designation of 
record.  

2) Transcript of Evidence. The designation of record for the transcript of evidence 
must specify that part of the record transcribed by the court reporter to be included 
in  the  record  on  appeal.  If  the  defendant  requests  the  entire  proceedings  to  be 
included, the designation of record must so state. The certification of the transcript 
shall  be  made  by  the  court  reporter  and  be  in  substantially  the  same  form  as

(1) An original and two (2) certified copies of all designated transcripts, the original and 
one (1) certified copy to be sent to the Clerk of the Court of Criminal Appeals and one (1) 
certified copy to either the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System, pursuant to Section 1362 
of Title 22 , or retained or other appointed counsel of record on appeal. In capital cases in 
which an application for post-conviction relief will be filed, and in which the Oklahoma 
Indigent Defense System or another attorney has been appointed for that purpose, another 
copy  in  addition  to  the  copies  specified  above  shall  be  sent  to  the  Oklahoma  Indigent 
Defense System or the attorney appointed. See Section 1089(B) of Title 22.  

2) In the event the petition in error is timely filed but the designated transcripts have not 
been completed and cannot be filed, the court reporter who transcribed the trial, or other 
proceeding, must submit an affidavit to this Court showing why the transcripts have not 
been completed and requesting an extension of time not exceeding thirty (30) days. A copy 
of the affidavit and request for extension of time shall be mailed to the trial  judge, trial 
court clerk and appellate counsel. The affidavit must be submitted by the court reporter to 
this Court and must show good cause why the additional time is needed. An affidavit from 
an appellant's attorney, the attorney's assistant or any person other than the court reporter 
shall not suffice. For purposes of this Section, "good cause shown" shall not include press 
of business. If the reason the transcripts have not been timely filed is due to the fault of the 
appellant, the court reporter shall set out with specificity the facts constituting appellant's 
fault. The Presiding Judge may grant requests for extensions. The clerk of this Court shall 
send a copy of the order granting or denying the extension request to the trial judge, trial 
court clerk and appellate counsel in addition to the court reporter. After filing the affidavit 
and  request  for  extension  out  of  time  pursuant  to  this  subsection,  any  request  for  an 
extension beyond sixty (60) days from the original due date will require the court reporter 
to contact the Presiding Judge or Vice-Presiding Judge who shall, subject to the approval 
of the Court at confidence, make a determination of whether additional time can be granted 
or whether the court reporter must appear in person before the Presiding Judge or the Vice-
Presiding  Judge,  or  the  Court  en  banc  to  show  cause  as  to  why  any  additional  time  is 
required. See also Rule 9.2(C) and Section 701.13 of Title 21. If the Court determines the 
failure  to  timely  file  the  transcripts  is  due  to  the  fault  of  appellant,  the  appeal  may  be 
dismissed after notice and opportunity to be heard.  

3) The appellate counsel is required to constantly monitor the preparation of the records 
for appeal and is ultimately responsible for the timely filing of the appeal records. Requests 
for assistance in the timely preparation of the records may be submitted to this Court for 
appropriate action, to include applications for writ of mandamus.

filed on appeal. At the time the trial court approves transcripts of preliminary hearings or pretrial 
proceedings to be prepared at State expense, the order entered shall require the court reporter to 
file the transcripts with the trial court clerk and provide access to the parties for trial preparation 
with the requirement all transcripts shall be returned to the clerk of the trial court within ten (10) 
days of the sentencing. The order shall also direct that a party granted access to the transcripts for 
purpose of appeal shall return all transcripts to the clerk of the trial court within twenty (20) days 
from the date the mandate of the decision on appeal is entered by this Court. This order shall ensure 
notice of requirements is directed to both the State and the defendant. See Section 106.4a of Title 
20; Tiger v. State, 859 P.2d 1117 (Okl.Cr.1993).

(states in part:) 

. Duties of Court Reporter to Assemble Exhibits.  

1) The court reporter shall ensure trial exhibits are indexed and incorporated into the transcript by 
physical attachment. In the event the exhibit cannot be physically attached, the court reporter shall 
attach a clear and viewable photograph or photocopy accurately depicting the exhibit to both the 
original transcript (or separate volume if necessary) and copies as required below. All copies of 
exhibits, including photographs, provided pursuant to this Rule shall be in color unless the original 
exhibit was in black and white. Black and white photocopies of color exhibits are not acceptable. 
If the exhibit is an audio or video tape or other electronically reproduced medium, the reporter 
shall be responsible for ensuring that the original and two (2) copies of the item are filed with the 
transcripts. In each instance, as a condition to the admissibility of the exhibit for consideration on 
appeal, the trial court shall ensure the party introducing the exhibit shall be responsible for both its 
reproduction in the same quality as the original, including delivery to the court reporter, and the 
cost of reproduction. If a party fails to comply with a reporter's request to provide copies of exhibits 
in  accordance with  this Rule, the court reporter,  after completion of the transcripts,  shall file a 
notice of non-completion with the clerk of the District Court and the Clerk of this Court setting 
out with specificity the items that have not been provided, when the request was made and the 
party who has failed to comply with this Rule..  

(2) The original transcript, indexed and certified as correct, together with two (2) certified copies 
(original and three (3) certified copies in capital cases), and attached exhibits or photos or copies 
of exhibits, in volumes not to exceed three hundred (300) pages of text per volume, shall be filed 
with the court clerk in the trial court by the court reporter within sufficient time to allow the trial 
court clerk to  file the notice required by Rule 2.3(A) within ninety  (90)  days of Judgment  and 
Sentence in misdemeanor and regular felony appeals, and within six (6) months in capital appeals.  

(3)  Upon  the  filing  of  the  transcript,  the  court  reporter  is  required  to  notify  in  writing  the 
defendant's appellate attorney, the district attorney, the attorney general, the trial court clerk and 
the Clerk of this Court that the transcripts have been filed with the trial court clerk. This notice 
shall be specific, itemizing and describing with particularity all transcripts (by volume number or 
date of hearing) and exhibits (by number/letter and description) filed with the court clerk. If more 
than  one  court  reporter  was  involved  in  the  proceedings  at  issue,  each  court  reporter  shall  be 
responsible for filing a separate specific, itemized list. The clerk of the trial court shall file the 
notice with the record.

required  by  subpart  (B)(1)  of  this  Rule,  shall  be  incorporated  into  the  record  on  appeal  or 
transmitted to the Clerk of the Court of Criminal Appeals; PROVIDED HOWEVER, this Court 
may direct supplementation of the record for any exhibit necessary for the determination of the 
appeal. Under no circumstances will controlled or dangerous substances, weapons, or ammunition, 
or body fluids or tissues be included in the record. 

The  court  reporter  must  document  when  exhibits  leave  their  custody.    When  exhibits  are 
withdrawn, a copy of the receipt should be kept in the exhibit file.  When exhibits are filed with 
the court clerk, the filing should be documented on your information sheet.

. BEFORE ACTION. 

. PETITION. A person who desires to perpetuate his own testimony or that of another person 
regarding any matter that may be cognizable in any court may file a verified petition in the district 
court  in  the  county  of  the  residence  of  any  expected  adverse  party  for  such  perpetuation  of 
testimony. The petition shall be entitled in the name of the petitioner and shall show: 

. That the petitioner or his personal representative, heirs, beneficiaries, successors or assigns may 
be a party to an action cognizable in a court but is presently unable to bring it or cause it to be 
brought. 

. The subject matter of the expected action and his interest therein, and a copy, attached to the 
petition, of any written instrument the validity or construction of which may be called in question 
or which is connected with the subject matter of the requested deposition. 

. The facts which he desires to establish by the proposed testimony and his reasons for desiring 
to perpetuate it. 

. The names or, if the names are unknown, a description of the persons he expects will be adverse 
parties and their addresses so far as known.

. The names and addresses of the persons to  be examined and the substance of the testimony 
which he expects to elicit from each. 

he petition shall request an order authorizing the petitioner to take the depositions of the persons 

named in the petition to be examined for the purpose of perpetuating their testimony. 

. NOTICE AND SERVICE. The petitioner shall thereafter serve a notice upon each person named 
or  described  in  the  petition  as  an  expected  adverse  party,  together  with  a  copy  of  the  petition, 
stating that the petitioner will apply to the court, at a time and place named therein, for the order 
described in the petition. At least twenty (20) days before the date of hearing, the notice shall be 
served either within or without the state in the manner provided for personal service of summons. 
If such service cannot, with due diligence, be made upon any expected adverse party named or 
described in the petition, the court may enter such order as is just for service by publication or 
otherwise, and shall appoint, for persons not  served by personal  service, an attorney  who shall 
represent them and, if they are not otherwise represented, shall cross-examine the deponent. If any 
expected adverse party is a minor or incompetent the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for 
any such minor or incompetent not legally represented. 

. ORDER AND EXAMINATION. If the court is satisfied that the perpetuation of the testimony 
may  prevent  a  failure  or  delay  of  justice,  it  shall  enter  an  order  designating  or  describing  the 
persons whose depositions may be taken and specifying the subject matter of the examination and 
how the depositions shall be taken. The depositions may then be taken in  accordance with  the 
Oklahoma Discovery Code, Section 3224 et seq. of this title. The court may enter orders of the 
character provided for by Sections 3234 and 3235 of this title. For the purpose of applying the 
Oklahoma Discovery Code to depositions for perpetuating testimony, each reference to the court 
in which the action is pending shall be deemed to refer to the court in which the petition for such 
deposition was filed. 

. USE OF DEPOSITION. If a deposition to perpetuate testimony is taken under the Oklahoma 
Discovery  Code,  it  may  be  used  in  any  action  involving  the  same  subject  matter  subsequently 
brought in a court of this state, in accordance with the provisions of subsection A of Section 3232 
of this title. 

. PENDING APPEAL. If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of a district court or before 
the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, the district court in which the judgment 
was rendered may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony 
for use in the event of further proceedings in the district court. In such case, the party who desires 
to  perpetuate  the  testimony  may  make  a  motion  in  the  district  court  for  leave  to  take  the 
depositions, upon the same notice and service thereof as if the action was pending in the district 
court. The motion shall show: 

. The names and addresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which 
he expects to elicit from each;

. The reasons for perpetuating the testimony. 

f the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to  avoid a failure or delay of 
justice, it may enter an order allowing the depositions to be taken and may make orders of the 
character provided for by Sections 3234 and 3235 of this title, and thereupon the depositions may 
be  taken  and  used  in  the  same  manner  and  under  the  same  conditions  as  are  prescribed  in  the 
Oklahoma Discovery Code for depositions taken in actions pending in the district court. 

.  PERPETUATION  BY  ACTION.  The  procedures  prescribed  in  this  section  do  not  limit  the 

power of a court to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony. 

. FILING OF DEPOSITION. Depositions  taken under this section shall not  be filed with  the 
court in which the petition is filed or the motion is made except on order of the court or unless they 
are attached to a motion, response thereto, or are needed for use in a trial or hearing. 

. COSTS. The attorney taking any deposition under this section shall pay the costs thereof unless 

otherwise ordered by the court. 

.  DEPOSITIONS  TAKEN  IN  OTHER  JURISDICTIONS  ADMISSIBLE.  A  deposition  taken 
under procedures of another jurisdiction, which are similar to those in this section, is admissible 
in this state to the same extent as a deposition taken under this section. 
  

itle 12. Civil Procedure  

 Chapter 41 - Discovery Code 
 Section 3228 - Persons Before Whom Depositions May Be Taken 
 

. DEPOSITIONS TAKEN WITHIN OKLAHOMA. Within this state, depositions shall be taken 
before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the place where the examination is 
held,  or  before  a  person  appointed  by  the  court  in  which  the  action  is  pending.  A  person  so 
appointed has power to administer oaths and take testimony.  

The term officer as used in Sections 3230 through 3232 of this title includes a person appointed 
by the court or designated by the parties under Section 3229 of this title; except that on and after 
January 1, 1990, depositions taken within this state shall only be taken by an officer who is either 
a certified shorthand reporter (CSR) or a licensed shorthand reporter (LSR); provided however, on 
and after the effective date of this act, any person who was taking depositions by the steno-mask 
method of reporting within this state prior to January 1, 1990, may continue to take depositions 
within  this  state  if  the  person  provides  to  the  State  Board  of  Examiners  of  Official  Shorthand

and  by  an  attorney  licensed  to  practice  law  in  this  state,  declaring  that  the  person  has  taken 
depositions that were admitted into evidence in any court of this state. The certification shall be 
submitted within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this act to the State Board of Examiners 
of Official Shorthand Reporters or successor  entity of the  Board who shall issue said  person a 
certificate  as  an  acting  court  reporter  permitting  the  person  to  take  depositions  or  other  sworn 
statements, subpoena witnesses for depositions, issue affidavits in respect to the regular duties of 
the person, and administer oaths and affirmations with authority equal to that of a notary public.  

. DEPOSITIONS TAKEN OUTSIDE OF OKLAHOMA. Depositions may be taken outside of 

Oklahoma:  

. On notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place in which the examination 
is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of this state; or  

. Before a person commissioned by the court, and a person so commissioned shall have the power 
by virtue of his commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony; or  

. Pursuant to a letter rogatory.  

 commission or a letter rogatory shall be issued on application and notice and on terms that are 
just and appropriate. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter rogatory that the 
taking  of  the  deposition  in  any  other  manner  is  impracticable  or  inconvenient;  and  both  a 
commission  and  a  letter  rogatory  may  be  issued  in  proper  cases.  A  notice  or  commission  may 
designate the person before whom the deposition is to be taken either by name or descriptive title. 
Evidence obtained in response to a letter rogatory need not be excluded merely for the reason that 
it is not a verbatim transcript or that the testimony was not taken under oath or for any similar 
departure from the requirements for depositions taken within this state.  

. DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR INTEREST. No deposition shall be taken before a person who is 
a relative or employee or attorney or counsel of any of the parties, or is a relative or employee of 
such attorney or counsel, or is financially interested in the action.

unavailable for examination in this state unless deposed before that time. 

. A request for leave of court shall include a statement that the requesting party has in good faith 
conferred  or  attempted  to  confer  either  in  person  or  by  telephone  with  the  opposing  parties  to

delivered  to  the  other  party  or  parties  prior  to  or  at  the  commencement  of  the  taking  of  the 
deposition of the organization. A subpoena shall advise a nonparty organization of its duty to make 
such  a  designation.  The  persons  so  designated  shall  testify  as  to  matters  known  or  reasonably 
available to the organization. 
This  paragraph does not preclude taking a deposition  by any other procedure authorized in  the 
Oklahoma Discovery Code. 

. The parties may stipulate in writing or the court may upon motion order that a deposition be

All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the 
deposition, to the manner of taking it, to the evidence presented, to the conduct of any party, or to 
any other aspect of the proceedings shall be noted by the officer upon the record of the deposition; 
however, the examination shall proceed, with the testimony being taken subject to the objections. 

n lieu of participating in the oral  examination, parties may serve written questions in  a sealed 
envelope on the party taking the depositions and that party shall transmit them to the officer, who 
shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim. 

. MOTION TO TERMINATE OR LIMIT EXAMINATION. 

.  Any  objection  to  evidence  during  a  deposition  shall  be  stated  concisely  and  in  a 
nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A party may instruct a deponent not to answer only 
when  necessary  to  preserve  a  privilege  or  work  product  protection,  to  enforce  a  limitation  on 
evidence directed by the court, to present a motion under paragraph 2 of this subsection, or to move 
for a protective order under subsection C of Section 3226 of this title. If the court finds a person 
has engaged in conduct which has frustrated the fair examination of the deponent, it may impose 
upon the persons responsible an appropriate sanction, including the reasonable costs and attorney 
fees incurred by any parties as a result thereof. 

. At any time during the taking of the deposition, on motion of a party or of the deponent and 
upon  a  showing  that  the  examination  is  being  conducted  in  bad  faith  or  in  such  manner  as 
unreasonably to annoy, embarrass or oppress the deponent or party, the court in which the action 
is pending or the court in the county where the deposition is being taken may order the officer 
conducting the examination to cease taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of 
the taking of the deposition as provided in subsection C of Section 3226 of this title. If the order 
entered terminates the examination, it shall be resumed thereafter only upon the order of the court 
in which the action is pending. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the 
deposition shall be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion for the order provided for 
in this section. The provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection A of Section 3237 of this title apply to 
the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion. 

. REVIEW BY WITNESS; CHANGES; SIGNING. The deponent shall have the opportunity to 
review  the  transcript  of  the  deposition  unless  such  examination  and  reading  are  waived  by  the 
deponent and by the parties. After being notified by the officer that the transcript is available, the 
deponent  shall have thirty  (30) days in  which to  review it and, if there are changes in  form  or 
substance, to sign a statement reciting such changes and the reasons  given by the deponent for 
making them. The officer shall indicate in the certificate prescribed by paragraph 1 of subsection 
G of this section whether any review was requested and, if so, shall append any changes made by 
the deponent during the period allowed. 

. CERTIFICATION AND FILING BY OFFICER; EXHIBITS; COPIES; NOTICE OF FILING. 

. The officer shall certify on any stenographic deposition:

relative or employee of the attorney or counsel, and is not financially interested in the action. 

xcept on order of the court or unless a deposition is attached to  a motion response thereto, is 
needed for use in a trial or hearing, or the parties stipulate otherwise, depositions shall not be filed 
with the court clerk. The officer shall securely seal any stenographic deposition in  an envelope 
endorsed with the title of the action and marked "Deposition of (here insert name of witness)" and 
send it to the attorney who arranged for the deposition, who shall store it under conditions that will 
protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration. 

ocuments and things produced for inspection during the examination of the witness shall, upon 
the  request  of  a  party,  be  marked  for  identification  and  annexed  to  the  deposition  and  may  be

may: 

.  Offer  copies  to  be  marked  for  identification  and  annexed  to  the  deposition  and  to  serve  as 
originals if he affords to all parties fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparison with the 
originals, or 

. Offer the originals to be marked for identification, after giving to each party an opportunity to 
inspect and copy them, in which event the materials may then be used in the same manner as if 
annexed to the deposition. Any party may move for an order that the original be annexed to and 
returned with the deposition to the court, pending final disposition of the case. 

. Each attorney who takes the deposition of a witness or of a party shall bear all expenses thereof, 
including the cost of transcription, and shall furnish upon request to the adverse party or parties, 
free of charge, one copy of the transcribed deposition. If the party taking the deposition recorded 
it on videotape or by other nonstenographic means, that party shall also furnish upon request to 
the adverse party or parties, free of charge, one copy of the videotape or other recording of the 
deposition. 

. FAILURE TO ATTEND OR TO SERVE SUBPOENA; EXPENSES. 

. If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition fails to attend and proceed therewith 
and another party attends in person or by attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may order the

party and his or her attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney fees. 

. If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition of a witness fails to serve a subpoena 
upon  the  witness  and  the  witness  because  of  such  failure  does  not  attend,  and  if  another  party 
attends in  person or by  attorney because he or she expects  the deposition of that witness to  be 
taken, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the reasonable 
expenses incurred by that party and his or her attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney 
fees. 

. WITNESS FEES. 

. The attendance and travel fees for a witness shall be paid as provided in Section 400 of this title. 

.  A  party  deponent  must  attend  the  taking  of  a  deposition  without  the  payment  or  tender  of 
attendance or travel fees. 

. TAXING OF COSTS OF DEPOSITIONS. The cost of transcription of a deposition, as verified 
by the statement of the certified court reporter, the fees of the sheriff for serving the notice to take 
depositions and fees of witnesses shall each constitute an item of costs to be taxed in the case in 
the manner provided by law. The court may upon motion of a party retax the costs if the court finds 
the deposition was unauthorized by statute or unnecessary for protection of the interest of the party 
taking the deposition. 

itle 12. Civil Procedure  

 Chapter 41 - Discovery Code 
 Section 3232 – Use of depositions 
 

A.  USE  OF  DEPOSITIONS.  At  the  trial  or  upon  the  hearing  of  a  motion  or  an  interlocutory 
proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the Oklahoma Evidence Code 
applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against any party who 
was present or who was represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice 
thereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions: 

. Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the 
testimony of deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose permitted by the Oklahoma Evidence 
Code; 

. The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, 
director or managing agent, or a person designated under paragraph 6 of subsection C of Section 
3230  or  subsection  A  of  Section  3231  of  this  title  to  testify  on  behalf  of  a  public  or  private

any purpose; 

. The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party may be used for any purpose if the court 
finds: 

. That the witness is dead, or 

. That the witness does not reside in the county where the action or proceeding is pending or is 
sent for trial by a change of venue or the witness is absent therefrom, unless it appears that the 
absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition, or 

. That the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity or imprisonment, 
or 

. That the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness 
by subpoena, or 
e. That the witness is an expert witness, who for purposes of this section is a person educated in a 
special  art  or  profession  or  a  person  possessing  special  or  peculiar  knowledge  acquired  from 
practical experience, or 

. Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, 
in  the  interest  of  justice  and  with  due  regard  to  the  importance  of  presenting  the  testimony  of 
witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used. 

othing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the authority of the appropriate office to issue 

a subpoena to compel an expert witness to appear in the same manner as any other witness; 

. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the 
introduction of any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, 
and any party may introduce any other parts. 

ubstitution of parties pursuant to Section 1081, 1082, 1083 or 2025 of this title does not affect 
the right to use depositions previously taken. When an action has been brought in this state or in 
any court of the United States or of any other state and another action involving the same subject 
matter  is  afterward  brought  between  the  same  parties  or  their  representatives  or  successors  in 
interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in the former action may be used in the latter 
as if originally taken therefor. 

 deposition previously taken may also be used as permitted by the Oklahoma Evidence Code. 

. OBJECTIONS TO ADMISSIBILITY. Subject to the provisions of subsection B of Section 3228 
of this title and paragraph 3 of subsection D of this section, objection may be made, at the trial or

the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying. 

.  FORM  OF  PRESENTATION.  Except  as  otherwise  directed  by  the  court,  a  party  offering 
deposition testimony pursuant to this section may offer it in stenographic or nonstenographic form, 
but,  if  in  nonstenographic  form,  the  party  shall  also  provide  the  court  with  a  transcript  of  the 
portions so offered. 

. EFFECT OF ERRORS AND IRREGULARITIES IN DEPOSITIONS.

unless written objection is promptly served upon the party giving the notice. 

.  AS  TO  DISQUALIFICATION  OF  OFFICER.  Objection  to  taking  a  deposition  because  of

. AS TO TAKING OF DEPOSITION. 

. Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy or materiality of

at that time. 

. Errors and irregularities occurring in the manner of the oral examination in the taking of the 
deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of 
parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed or cured if promptly presented, 
are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition. 

. Objections to the form of written questions submitted under Section 3231 of this title are waived 
unless served in writing upon the party propounding them within the time allowed for serving the 
succeeding  cross  or  other  questions  or  within  five  (5)  days  after  service  of  the  last  questions 
authorized. 

. AS TO COMPLETION AND RETURN OF DEPOSITION. Errors and irregularities: 

. in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or recorded, or 

.  in  the  manner  in  which  the  deposition  is  prepared,  signed,  certified,  sealed,  endorsed, 
transmitted, filed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under Sections 3230 and 3231 of this title 
are waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable

PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR DEPOSITIONS 

The following are miscellaneous practical suggestions for court reporters. 

Transcript format for depositions or other statements should follow those prescribed by the 

 
Supreme Court and referenced in this guide. 

Before  a  deposition  begins,  the  reporter  should  ask  whether  the  deposition  is  to  be  held 

 
pursuant to any stipulations and if it is by agreement or notice.

    O

While the deposition is proceeding, nothing should be “off the record” unless both parties 
 
clearly agree.  Simply because one side says “off the record” means nothing.  Unless both sides agree, 
everything is to be on the record. 

Any exhibits to the deposition should be attached to the back of the original as well as each 
 
copy.  If the exhibits are too voluminous, they should be in a separate volume or envelope.  Always 
ask if the original exhibits are to be included in the transcript or if they need the originals returned and 
copies substituted. 

 
Under both Federal and Oklahoma state law, the witness may exercise the right to read and 
sign the deposition.  They have 30 days to do this.  The adverse lawyer will usually take responsibility 
for  providing  the  copy  at  his/her  expense  to  the  witness.    If  they  do  not  take  responsibility  for 
providing a copy of the deposition for the witness, the witness will need to come to your office and 
review  the  original.    You  should  mail  the  copy  of  the  deposition  with  the  original  signature  and 
correction page to the adverse attorney with your standard letter giving them 30 days to read and sign.  
Most reporters calendar the  matter for 30 days after the parties receive the deposition, and if you do 
not have the signature and correction pages back within 30 days of that date then seal the original 
with your certification that the witness failed to exercise their right and submit it to the deposing party. 

 
If  the  right  to  read  and sign  has  been  exercised  by  the  witness,  the original signature  and 
correction page should be inserted in the back of the original.  A copy of the signature and correction 
page should then be mailed to the parties. 

 

 

GRAND JURY 

Title 22, Section 311 - Definition of Grand Jury 

A grand jury is a body of men consisting of twelve jurors impaneled and sworn to inquire into and 
true  presentment  make  of  all  public  offenses  against  the  state  committed  or  triable  within  the 
county for which the court is holden. 

itle 22, Section 340 - Grand Jury - Advice of Court or District Attorney - Who 
May be Present - Interpreter - Investigation of District Attorney's Office 
 

A. The grand jury may at all reasonable times ask the advice of the court or of the district attorney. 
In no event shall the grand jury be advised as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence

necessary to return a true bill, in a matter under investigation before them. The district attorney, 
with or without a regularly appointed assistant district attorney individually or collectively, or if 
the district attorney and all of his or her assistants are disqualified for any reason, a district attorney 
or assistant district attorney from another district, appointed by the Attorney General of Oklahoma 
pursuant to Sections 215.9 and 215.13 of Title 19 of the Oklahoma Statutes, and where proper, the 
Attorney General, or an assistant attorney general, may at all times appear before the grand jury 
for the purpose of giving information or advice relative to any matter cognizable before them and 
may interrogate witnesses before them whenever he or she thinks it necessary. A qualified court 
reporter shall be present and take the testimony of all witnesses.  

. Upon request a transcript of the testimony or any portion thereof shall be made available to an 
accused or the district attorney, at the expense of the requesting party or officer, and, in the event 
of an indigent accused, at the expense of the state. Any person who obtains a copy of a transcript 
shall not reproduce the transcript in whole or in part or otherwise disclose its contents to any person 
other  than  his  or  her  attorney  without  leave  of  the  court.  Violation  of  this  provision  shall  be 
punishable as contempt. Provided, nothing in this section shall prohibit the attorney for he accused, 
the  district  attorney  or  assistant  district  attorney  from  reproducing  in  whole  or  in  part  the 
transcribed testimony of a witness he or she anticipates calling to testify at trial and providing same 
to said witness for the sole purpose of preparing for trial.  

. No person is permitted to be present during sessions of the grand jury except the members of 
the grand jury, the witness actually under examination and one attorney representing such witness, 
except that an interpreter, when necessary, may be present during the interrogation of a witness 
provided that, no person, except the members of the grand jury, shall be permitted to be present 
during the expression of juror opinions or the giving of votes upon any matter before the grand 
jury; provided further that neither the district attorney, nor an assistant district attorney, may be 
present  or participate in  an official capacity, as herein  provided, during an investigation by the 
grand jury of the district attorney's office, or of any person officially associated with said office.  

The reporter will be excused by the state/government attorney or the foreperson when discussion or 
voting on action is to take place. 

Upon the completion of the grand jury proceedings, all of the reporter's notes, exhibits, electronic 
recordings,  writer  diskettes,  and  everything  pertaining  to  the  official  record  are  secured,  to  be 
accessed by the reporter only or such other procedure as the court may direct.  Any personal notes 
made or materials with any information pertaining to the grand jury that is not a part of the official 
record are to be shredded and disposed of as required in a particular jurisdiction. 

The reporter should maintain a high degree of professionalism at all times when dealing with a grand 
jury and should not divulge information concerning anything to anyone outside of the grand jury 
room.

With all parties being present, the following proceedings were had in open court:) 

HE COURT:  All right, call your first witness on behalf of the Plaintiff.

alled as a witness on behalf of the plaintiff, after having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:

   For the record, would you state your name. 

   Okay.  And, Mr. Clark, what is your occupation? 

   

I am the general manager for Kit Manufacturing in McPherson, Kansas. 

 

I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 for identification.   Would you 
please  

 It's a copy of the original invoice for the Smiths' house. 

MR. DAVIS:  Move that Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 be admitted into evidence. 

                    MR. REECE:  No objection, Your Honor. 

THE COURT:  Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 is admitted in evidence. 

     (By Mr. Davis)  How were you to be paid for this mobile home? 

      We had contacted Fred Stewart for wholesale financing.  He was having a problem with his 

wholesale  

looring service at that time.  Supposedly he had sent in the necessary paper work to Chrysler, another

  We asked Mr. Stewart where the home was to be financed and retailed, and he told us that it 

o  be  financed  through  American  Finance  Services,  another  financial  institution  out  of  Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. 

XAMPLE OF COLLOQUY FORMAT: 

 

MR. McLANE:  That, Your Honor, is objectionable partly because it’s 

immaterial.   The only materiality of any of this line is to see whether this is a serious purpose, to 

request the list of shares.   And I think from the testimony to this point, that it is overwhelmingly 

established, and that their concern is not whether Mr. Smith is serious, but because he's serious. 

We haven't objected to a lot of this testimony and sparring and all this, but at this point we 

want to object to anything that bears on the future strategies or intentions, the kinds of matters that 

one side would like to know about the other when you are in a takeover situation. 

The cases that we submitted from the Delaware courts indicate that this is a common sort of 

thing that comes up in these cases.  The Defendants, who are being taken over, use the occasion of 

the summary litigation that is necessary to get the stockholders’ list to explore the strategies and 

intentions and financial capabilities of the parties who want to do the taking over. 

It has no real purpose in the lawsuit, but it does give them a peek into the enemy camp, so to 

speak, to find out how much money can these folks really come up with, how much do they think 

this company is really worth.
