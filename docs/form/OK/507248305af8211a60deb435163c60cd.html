Each of the following will be scored as one (1) error: 
1) 
2) 
3) 
4) 
5) 

Each wrong word or wrong form of a word, 
Each omitted, added or misplaced word, 
Each misspelled word or commonly used proper name, 
Each omitted capital letter clearly needed,  
Each number differing from the number that was spoken, 

Each improper designation of either the “Q” or “A,” 
Each contraction error, unless the difference in sound is not easily discernible, and 
Each transposition of one or more words. 

6) 
7) 
8) 

 

In  the  event  that  a  transcript  contains  an  aggregate  of  punctuation  errors  which,  in  the 
Board’s discretion, reflects an absence of knowledge on the part of the candidate regarding 
the basic rules of punctuation, five (5) errors will be counted against that candidate’s score.  

One (1) error will be counted for each incorrect segment of a hyphenated word.  
 
Each error will be indicated by a checkmark () right above it, and in the case of omitted 
or added words, the number of omissions or additions will precede the check mark. 

When five (5) errors are assessed for an aggregate of punctuation errors, that fact shall be 
indicated by the Board at the top of the first page of the examination. 

The following will not be counted as errors: 
1) 
2) 
3) 
4)

shorthand reporters shall annually renew their certificate on a form to be provided by the 
Board, through the office of the Administrative Director of the Courts, and shall pay an 
annual certificate renewal fee. The amount of the renewal fee shall be set by the Board, 
with  the  approval  of  the  Supreme  Court,  and  shall  be  paid  to  the  office  of  the 
Administrative Director of the Courts.  

Due Date: The annual renewal form and annual renewal fee must be submitted to the office 
of the Administrative Director of the Courts on or before February 15 of each year. No 
fewer than fourteen (14) days before February 15, the Board shall send notification to those 
court reporters who have not submitted the annual renewal form and/or annual renewal fee. 
Such notification shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the reporter as 
provided to the Secretary of the Board or the Administrative Office of the Courts. Every 
certificate which has not been renewed on or before February 15 shall be administratively 
suspended on that date by the Board.   

Suspension:  Failure to renew a certificate and pay the annual renewal  fee on or before 
February 15 shall result in administrative suspension on that date. In such case, the Board 
shall provide a list to the Supreme Court of those court reporters and shall recommend the 
suspension of each court reporter’s certificate. The order of the Supreme Court approving 
the  recommendation  of  the  Board  shall  operate  to  suspend  the  certificate  of  the  court 
reporter without necessity of a hearing. Such suspension shall be effective on February 15 
of that year. The court reporter shall be notified of the suspension by certified mail to the 
last  known  address  of  the  reporter  as  provided  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Board  or  the

Delinquent  Payment  Fee:  Every  certificate  which  has  not  been  renewed  on  or  before 
February 15 shall be subject to a delinquent payment fee. The amount of the delinquent 
payment fee shall be set by the Board, with the approval of the Supreme Court.   

Revocation:  Within two months of the administrative suspension, but not later than April 
15 of that year, a suspended certificate may be administratively reinstated, without need for 
application  or  hearing,  by  submission  of  the  renewal  form,  payment  of  the  annual 
certificate renewal fee, and payment of the delinquent payment fee. A suspended certificate 
which has not been reinstated on or before April 15 shall be administratively revoked on 
that date. In such case, the Board shall provide a list to the Supreme Court of those court 
reporters and shall recommend the revocation of each court reporter’s certificate. The order 
of the Supreme Court approving the recommendation of the Board shall operate to revoke 
the certificate of the court reporter without necessity of a hearing. Such revocation shall be 
effective on April 15 of that year. The court reporter shall be notified of the revocation by 
certified mail to the last known address of the reporter as provided to the Secretary of the 
Board or the Administrative Office of the Courts.

shall be considered submitted to the office of the Administrative Director of the Courts on 
the  date  the  materials  are  received  in  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts.  In  all 
instances where the date of submission is at issue, the court reporter shall have the burden 
of proving the date the materials were received in the Administrative Office of the Courts.

the United States Postal Service; a completed certificate of delivery from a private delivery 
or courier service other than the United States Postal Service; or the date the materials are 
stamped received in the office of the Administrative Director.

discretion.  The  formal  disciplinary  procedures  provided  for  by  the  Rules  Governing 
Disciplinary  Proceedings  of  the  State  Board  of  Examiners  of  Certified  Shorthand 
Reporters,  including  the  notice  and  hearing  requirements,  have  no  application  to 
administrative suspensions and revocations based solely on failure to renew a certificate.   

Reinstatement  after  Revocation:  Any  court  reporter  who  has  had  his  or  her  certificate 
revoked pursuant to this Rule may seek reinstatement only as set forth in Rule 10 of the

ule 22. 

Standards Governing Approval of Continuing Education Programs  

he following standards will govern the approval of continuing education programs by the Board.    

The program must have significant intellectual or practical content and its primary 
objective  must  be  to  increase  the  court  reporter’s  professional  competence  as  a 
reporter.   

The program must be offered by a sponsor having substantial, recent experience in 
offering continuing court reporter education of demonstrated ability to organize and 
present effectively continuing court reporter education. Demonstrated ability arises 
partly from the extent to which individuals with court reporter and/or legal training 
or educational experience are involved in the planning, instruction and supervision 
of the program.  

The  program  itself  must  be  conducted  by  an  individual  or  group  qualified  by 
practical  or  academic  experience.  The  program  including  the  named  advertised 
participants  must  be  conducted  substantially  as  planned,  subject  to  emergency 
withdrawals and alterations. 

Thorough, high quality, readable, and carefully prepared written materials must be 
made  available  to  all  participants  at  or  before  the  time  the  course  is  presented, 
unless the absence of such materials is recognized as reasonable and approved by 
the  Board. A mere  outline  without citations  or  explanatory notations will not be 
sufficient. 

pproval  for  credit  may  be  given  for  programs  where  audiovisual  recorded  or 
reproduced  material  is  used.  Television  video  programs  and  motion  picture 
programs  with  sound  shall  qualify  for  continuing  education  credit  in  the  same 
manner as a live continuing education program provided: (a) the original program 
was  approved  for  continuing  education  credit  as  provided  in  these  rules,  or  the 
visual recorded program has been approved by the Board under these rules, and (b) 
each person attending the video presentation is furnished written materials which 
meet the requirements set forth above.

Annual Continuing Education Report 

Hours Must be Earned During Calendar Year: Unless an exemption request, as provided 
for in Section 1503.1 of Title 20 of the Oklahoma Statutes, has been approved by the Board, 
the  required  number  of  continuing  education  hours  must  be  earned  during  the  calendar 
year, defined as January 1 through December 31. Failure to obtain the requisite number of 
continuing education hours on or before December 31 of the year in which they are required 
shall result in a continuing education penalty fee. The amount of the continuing education 
penalty fee shall be set by the Board, with the approval of the Supreme Court.   

 Annual Continuing Education Compliance Report: On or before February 15 of each year, 
all court reporters required to earn continuing education hours shall file a compliance report 
documenting the previous year’s continuing education, on a form to be provided by the 
Board, through the office of the Administrative Director of the Courts. If the compliance 
report includes any continuing education hours which were earned after December 31 of 
the previous year, the report shall be accompanied by payment of the continuing education 
penalty fee. In no case may continuing education hours be used for more than one calendar 
year’s compliance report. 

Due  Date:  The  continuing  education  compliance  report,  and  any  applicable  continuing 
education penalty fee, must be submitted to the office of the Administrative Director of the 
Courts on or before February 15 of each year. No fewer than fourteen (14) days before 
February  15,  the  Board  shall  send  notification  to  those  court  reporters  who  have  not 
fulfilled the continuing education requirement for the previous year and/or submitted the 
continuing education compliance report. Such notification shall be sent by certified mail to 
the  last  known  address  of  the  reporter  as  provided  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Board  or  the 
Administrative Office of the Courts.   

Suspension: Failure to earn the required continuing education hours, to submit a completed 
compliance  report,  and/or  to  pay  any  applicable continuing  education  penalty  fee  on  or 
before February 15 shall result in administrative suspension on that date. In such case, the 
Board  shall  provide  a  list  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  those  court  reporters  and  shall 
recommend the suspension of each court reporter’s certificate. The order of the Supreme 
Court approving the recommendation of the Board shall operate to suspend the certificate

of the court reporter without necessity of a hearing. Such suspension shall be effective on 
February 15 of that year. The court reporter shall be notified of the suspension by certified 
mail to the last known address of the reporter as provided to the Secretary of the Board or 
the Administrative Office of the Courts.     

Continuing  Education  Suspension  Fee:  Any  court  reporter  whose  certificate  has  been 
suspended for failure to earn the required number of continuing education hours, to submit 
a  completed  compliance  report,  and/or  to  pay  any  applicable  penalty  fee  on  or  before 
February 15 shall be subject to a continuing education suspension fee. The amount of the 
continuing education suspension fee shall be set by the Board, with the approval of the 
Supreme Court.   

Revocation:  Within  two  (2)  months  of  the  administrative  suspension,  but  not  later  than 
April 15 of that year, a suspended certificate may be administratively reinstated, without 
need for application or hearing, by submission of a completed compliance report indicating 
fulfillment  of  all  continuing  education  requirements  for  the  previous  calendar  year, 
payment of any applicable penalty fee, and payment of the continuing education suspension 
fee. A suspended certificate which has not been reinstated on or before April 15 shall be 
administratively revoked on that date. In such case, the Board shall provide a list to the 
Supreme Court of those court reporters and shall recommend the revocation of each court 
reporter’s certificate. The order of the Supreme Court approving the recommendation of 
the Board shall operate to revoke the certificate of the court reporter without necessity of a 
hearing. Such revocation shall be effective on April 15 of that year. The court reporter shall 
be notified of the revocation by certified mail to the last known address of the reporter as 
provided to the Secretary of the Board or the Administrative Office of the Courts. 

Date of Submission: For purposes of this Rule, the continuing education compliance report 
and any required penalty fee or suspension fee shall be considered submitted to the office 
of the Administrative Director of the Courts on the date the materials are received in the 
Administrative Office  of  the  Courts.  In all instances where the date of submission is at 
issue,  the  court  reporter  shall  have  the  burden  of  proving  the  date  the  materials  were 
received in the Administrative Office of the Courts. Though it may consider other proof, 
the  Board  will  accept  the  following  as  conclusive  proof  of  the  date  of  receipt:  a  return 
receipt of delivery for registered or certified mail from the United States Postal Service; a 
completed certificate of delivery from a private delivery or courier service other than the 
United States Postal Service; or the date the materials are stamped received in the office of

any accrued certificate renewal fee, delinquent payment fee, continuing education penalty 
fee,  or  continuing  education  suspension  fee  must  be  submitted  with  the  application  for 
retired status. If the court reporter’s certificate is current and in good standing, no fee is 
required to apply for retired status.   

Qualifying applications for voluntary retired status may be granted without formal action 
by the Board.    

The Board shall deny a request to place a court reporter on retired status if there are any 
current or pending complaints or formal disciplinary actions against the court reporter, or 
if the court reporter’s certificate is revoked or suspended pursuant to formal disciplinary 
action. 

A  court  reporter  who  holds  a  retired  certificate  will  be  exempt  from  payment  of  the 
certificate renewal fees and the continuing education requirements. However, the holder of 
a retired certificate may not engage in the practice of court reporting in Oklahoma.
