complaint shall be as follows: 

The Board shall furnish forms for a request for investigation to each person who alleges 
misconduct of a court reporter.  Each complaint shall be in writing, although not necessarily 
in the prescribed form, and signed by the complainant.  A complaint may be filed by any 
person, including another court reporter, who has knowledge or information of misconduct 
of a court reporter.  The Board may initiate a complaint upon its own motion. 
 
A complaint shall be filed with the Secretary of the Board, who shall transmit copies to all 
members of the Board.  The Board shall conduct preliminary investigation to determine 
whether there are facts sufficient to warrant formal disciplinary proceedings.

The Board may interview or subpoena potential witnesses. 
The Board shall inform the court reporter involved of the nature of the complaint

complainant by filing a Petition for Review with the Clerk of the Supreme Court not more

REPORTERS

Of Examiners of Certified Shorthand Reporters, 
Complainant, 
___________________

(Name of Accused), 
Respondent, 
 

 

 

 

 

COMPLAINT 

 

No. 

The complaint shall state the specific facts constituting the alleged misconduct, whether 
prior misconduct has resulted in discipline, and whether prior investigations of misconduct 
are  to  be  relied  upon  to  enhance  discipline.    Any  prior  acts  or  conduct  relied  upon  to 
enhance  discipline  shall  be  so  stated  and  set  forth  by  specific  allegation  of  fact.    The 
complaint shall be attested by the Chairman of the Board. 

Should  the  complaint  allege  as  grounds  for  discipline  the  final  conviction  of  a  court 
reporter,  in  any  jurisdiction,  of  a  criminal  offense  which  indicates  a  clear  and  rational 
likelihood  that  the  court  reporter  will  not  properly  discharge  his  or  her  duties  and 
responsibilities as a certified shorthand reporter, there shall be attached thereto a certified 
copy of the indictment or information, and a certified copy of the judgment and sentence 
on a plea of guilty, order deferring judgment and sentence, or judgment and sentence of 
conviction.  Such documents, regardless of the pendency of an appeal, shall constitute the 
charge  and  be  conclusive  evidence  of  the  commission  of  the  crime  upon  which  the 
judgment  is  based  and  shall  suffice  as  the  basis  for  discipline  in  accordance  with  these 
rules.    Thereafter,  the  issues  in  a  formal  proceeding  shall  be  limited  to  whether  the 
conviction  demonstrates  a  clear  and  rational  likelihood  that  the  court  reporter  will  not 
properly  discharge  his  or  her  duties  and  responsibilities,  and  the  nature  and  extent  of 
discipline to be imposed.   
 

1)  If  an  appeal  is  perfected  from  the  judgment  of  conviction  and  such  judgment  is 
reversed, the disciplinary proceedings based on such conviction shall be dismissed 
immediately and the court reporter involved restored to his/her former status.   
2)  Conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to the imposition 
of discipline.  Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board from initiating and 
conducting formal disciplinary proceedings upon charges identical to those set forth 
in a criminal complaint, indictment, or information, notwithstanding the pendency 
or final disposition of the criminal action. 

 

 

 

) 

  b

The  Secretary  of  the  Board  shall  cause  the  complaint  together  with  notice  of  a  hearing 
before the Board thereon to be sent to the court reporter involved.  The hearing before the 
Board shall be set no earlier than thirty (30) days from the date of mailing of the complaint 
and notice.  The Chairman of the Board may, in his or her discretion, grant continuances 
for good cause known. 
 
Upon receipt of sufficient evidence that a court reporter has engaged in conduct indicating 
that  he  or  she  is  unfit  to  practice  court  reporting,  and  where  such  conduct  poses  an 
immediate  threat  of  public  harm,  the  Board  may,  in  its  discretion,  request  the  Supreme 
Court  to  order  the  immediate  interim  suspension  of  that  court  reporter.    In  its  order  of 
interim suspension, the Court shall direct the court reporter to appear before the Board at a 
time certain, to show cause why the order of interim suspension should be set aside.  Upon 
good  cause  shown,  the  Board  may  request  the  Court  to  set  aside  its  order  of  interim 
suspension when it appears to be in the interest of justice to do so, with due regard being 
given to maintaining the integrity of and confidence in the court reporting profession. 
 
Upon  written request made  not less than  fifteen  (15)  days prior to  the hearing date, the 
court reporter respondent shall be provided with a list of all witnesses the Board reasonably 
anticipates may be called to testify at the hearing and copies of all documentary evidence 
supporting  the  allegations  of  the  complaint.    (These  will  be  provided  by  the  Attorney 
General or an Assistant Attorney General, not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing 
date.)  The court reporter respondent, not less than five (5) days prior to the hearing, shall 
submit  a  list  of  all  witnesses  the  respondent  anticipates  may  be  called  to  testify  at  the 
hearing and all documentary evidence the court reporter intends to introduce as evidence 
in defense of the charges in the complaint or as to mitigation of discipline.  The Board may 
in its discretion and for good cause shown modify the time limits herein imposed. 

Effective January 1, 2010) 

ule 7. 

Disciplinary Hearings 

The Board, under signature of the Chairperson on behalf of the Board, shall have power to 
issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses on behalf of the State or the court 
reporter involved.   
 
The Chairperson shall preside over formal disciplinary hearings and, if necessary, rule on 
questions of procedure.  Disciplinary hearings shall be conducted in an orderly manner, 
generally following the order of proceedings in civil matters.  However, the formal rules 
of evidence and civil procedure shall not apply to disciplinary hearings before the Board.

adjourned or continued to a date certain as the Board in its discretion shall decide.

Board, when acting in its capacity as a quasi-judicial body, may close the meeting to the 
public  for  purposes  of  deliberations  only.  All  votes  of  the  Board  regarding  disciplinary 
matters shall be publicly cast and recorded.  At the discretion of the Chairperson, the Board 
may permit the use of teleconferencing and videoconferencing technology in any stage of 
its  disciplinary  proceedings. 
In  any  disciplinary  proceeding  conducted  by 
videoconference,  the  Board  shall  follow  the  same  general  provisions  applicable  to 
videoconferencing in the District Courts, as set forth in Rule 34, Paragraph A, Rules of the 
District Courts, Title 12, Chapter 2, Appendix.   
 
Decisions of the Board shall be in writing with findings of fact and conclusions of law as 
applicable, including a recommendation as to discipline, if such is found to be indicated. 
The written decision of the Board shall reflect the votes of the members for or against the 
Board’s  recommendation.  The  written  decision  of  the  Board  shall  constitute  its 
recommendation to the Supreme Court for or against discipline. If the recommendation is 
for discipline, the Board may recommend: 

 

 
Suspension for a period of time up to one (1) year; or  
Revocation of the enrollment of a certified court reporter, or revocation of the status 
of a person appointed as a temporary court reporter pursuant to Section 106.3B(d) 
of Title 20 of the Oklahoma Statutes.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
