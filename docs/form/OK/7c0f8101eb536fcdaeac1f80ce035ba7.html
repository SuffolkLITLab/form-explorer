The Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma
2017

Stuart Ostler, Oklahoma Capitol Photographer

“The courts of justice of the State shall be open to every person, and speedy and 
certain remedy afforded for every wrong and for every injury to person, property, 
or reputation; and right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial, 
delay, or prejudice.”

Okla. Const. art. 2, §6

The publication, printed by the University of Oklahoma Press, is issued by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.  Twenty-five copies have been printed 
at a cost of $________ to the taxpayers of the State of Oklahoma.  Copies have been deposited with the Publications Clearinghouse of the 
Oklahoma Department of Libraries.  It is located at the following website: www.oscn.net.

Oklahoma Art In Public Places and The Veterans’ Memorial

Art in Public Places, the brainchild of Betty Price, pro-
vided funding for the art used in the public spaces of the 
Oklahoma Judicial Center.  One-third of this funding 
was used to restore the Oklahoma Veteran’s Memorial.  
The Memorial was constructed as a place to honor the 
Oklahomans who gave their lives to defend our Con-
stitution and our country.  Because their daily work is 
to uphold the Constitutions of the United States and of 
Oklahoma, the Supreme Court determined that there 
was no better use for these public monies than to honor 
those who gave their lives to preserve our liberties.

The memorial sculpture was originally created in 1986 
by Jay O’Melia and Bill Sowell.  It bears a plaque list-
ing the names of the Oklahomans awarded the Medal of 
Honor:
Joseph L. Epps
George P. Hays
Samuel M. Sampler
Harold L. Turner
John L. Smith
Ken D. Bailey

The Supreme Court

The Courtroom, a beautiful room housed in the State Capitol, belongs to the people of Oklahoma, as do all 
courtrooms in the State.  All sessions conducted in the Courtroom are open to the public.  Citizens are wel-
come, and they are urged to attend these sessions.  Along the walls of the Courtroom are the portraits of the 
first five Supreme Court Justices: R.L. Williams, Matthew Kane, Jesse J. Dunn, John B. Turner, and Samuel 
W. Hayes.  The pictures of the current members of the Court are placed on the walls immediately outside
the Courtroom doors.  Pursuant to the Oklahoma Constitution, the first five Justices initially presided over
all civil and criminal cases, but as the population began to grow and the court docket lengthened, it became
clear that a five-judge court would not be able to handle all the cases.  Four other Justices were appointed
in 1917.  In 1918, the Court of Criminal Appeals was statutorily created and three judges were appointed to
preside over all criminal matters.  Since June 30, 1987, the Court of Criminal Appeals has consisted of five
judges.

Solid mahogany found throughout the room was imported from the West Indies in 1918.  Four large pillars 
of Vermont marble, weighing two tons each, support the ceiling.  The ceiling is one of the most striking as-
pects of the Courtroom.  The ten solid brass light fixtures illuminating the Courtroom were designed in New 
York City in 1970.  Vermont marble beneath the ceiling at the north and south ends of the Courtroom bears 
the following inscriptions respectively: “The safety of the State is the highest law”—Justinian and “The 
foundations of justice are that no man shall suffer wrong”—Cicero.  

In the summer of 2011, the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Administrative 
Office of the Courts, and the Oklahoma Courts Management Information Systems moved into the newly 
opened Oklahoma Judicial Center.  This building, a portion of which is new construction and a portion of 
which consists of restoration of the Oklahoma Historical Society building built in 1929, now serves as one 
collective space for the administration of the Oklahoma Courts.  The building was built with Georgia granite 
and limestone from Oolithic, Indiana, the same limestone which is found on the Empire State Building in 
New York, and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.  It is located directly south and east of the State Capitol 
Building.  Justice Yvonne Kauger, Oklahoma Judicial Center Building Committee Chair, has overseen and 
shepherded the renovation of the building.  In 2017, a photo of a the Supreme Court Building beginning 
construction was discovered by Stuart Ostler, Oklahoma Capitol Photographer.  It is pictured on the cover of 
this brochure, in the background and to the right of the west end of the Capitol Building. 

Although the new building hosts a Hearing Room, the Supreme Court pursuant to 73 O.S. 2011 §15.1 main-
tains control of the State Capitol Conference Room and Courtroom for judicial court sessions and ceremo-
nies.  The Court of Criminal Appeals has replicated its former Courtroom which was located in the State 
Capitol in the Oklahoma Judicial Center.

The Court of Criminal Appeals 

Unlike most states, Oklahoma has two courts of last 
resort.  The Supreme Court determines all issues of 
a civil nature, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal 
Appeals decides all criminal matters.  Members 
of these courts and of the Court of Civil Appeals 
are appointed by the Governor from a list of three 
names submitted by the Oklahoma Judicial Nomi-
nating Commission.

In making its decision, the Oklahoma Supreme 
Court interprets both the State and Federal Con-
stitutions.  If the question presented is one purely 
of state law, the Oklahoma Supreme Court is the 
final arbiter.  An opinion of the Oklahoma Supreme 
Court, based on the Oklahoma Constitution, afford-
ing greater rights than those preserved by the United 
States Constitution may not be overturned by the 
United States Supreme Court.  

Criminal cases fall within the exclusive appellate ju-
risdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeals.  Pursu-
ant to art. 7 § 4, if a conflict arises over the jurisdic-
tion of the two courts—Supreme Court or Court of 
Criminal Appeals—the Supreme Court determines 
which court has jurisdiction.  Its determination is 
final and not subject to review.

peals.

The Court of Civil Appeals

The Court of Civil Appeals is responsible for the majority of appellate decisions.  These opinions may be 
released for publication either by the Court of Civil Appeals or by the Supreme Court.  When an opinion 
is released for publication by the Supreme Court, it has precedential value.  The Court of Civil Appeals is 
comprised of four divisions, each composed of three Judges.  Divisions I and III of the Court of Civil Ap-
peals are located in Oklahoma City at the Denver Davison Building, and Divisions II and IV are housed in 
Tulsa at the Kerr-Edmondson Building.

In Oklahoma, all litigants are entitled to an appeal as a matter of right.  Appeals to the Court of Criminal Ap-
peals come directly from the District Court.  All appeals in civil cases are made to the Oklahoma Supreme 
Court.  Appeals may be made to the Supreme Court from the District Court, Workers’ Compensation Court 
of Existing Claims, Court of Tax Review, and state agencies such as the Department of Public Safety, Okla-
homa Tax Commission, Oklahoma Corporation Commission and the Department of Human Services.  Many 
of these appeals are directed by the Supreme Court to one of the four divisions of the Court of Civil Ap-
peals.  Most cases reviewed in the Supreme Court are from the Court of Civil Appeals.  These cases come 
before the Supreme Court on petitions for certiorari review.

Certiorari allows the Supreme Court to bring the record up from the Court of Civil Appeals and to review 
the Court of Civil Appeals’ decision.  A review of an opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals in the Supreme 
Court on writ of certiorari is a matter of sound judicial discretion, and will be granted only when there are 
special and important reasons–and if a majority of the Justices direct that certiorari be granted.  Certiorari 
may be granted when the Court of Civil Appeals has decided a question of substance not previously deter-
mined by the Oklahoma Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court, the Court of Civil Appeals’ 
divisions have issued conflicting opinions, or when the Court of Civil Appeals’ decision is a substantial 
departure from the usual course of judicial proceedings.

When new first impression issues, or important issues of law, or matters of great public interest are at stake, 
the Supreme Court may retain a case directly from the trial court.  In addition to appeals from a trial, issues 
come to the Supreme Court within its general superintending control over all inferior courts, agencies, com-
missions and boards created by law, with the exception of the Court on the Judiciary and the Senate sitting 
as a Court of Impeachment.

Disposition of cases pending before the Supreme Court

The Supreme Court operates very differently from a trial court.  There is no jury and, except on very rare 
occasions, no testimony from witnesses.  The Court receives the record of the trial (transcript and any court 
papers filed in the case), and written arguments (briefs) of the lawyers.  The Supreme Court has total discre-
tion in deciding which cases it will hear.  Cases which are not assigned to the Court of Civil Appeals for 
decision are assigned on a rotating basis to an individual Justice by the Chief Justice.  If the Chief Justice is 
disqualified, the assignment is made by the Vice Chief Justice or by the senior justice in the majority.  Cases 
coming to the Court from the Court of Civil Appeals on certiorari are assigned during Monday conferences, 
also on a rotating basis.  The assigned Justice presents a petition for certiorari and makes a recommendation 
to the Court.  The granting or denial of a petition for certiorari is discretionary.  If a petition for certiorari is 

8

granted, the case is assigned to a Justice to write an opinion. 

Under art. 7, §5 of the Oklahoma Constitution, the concurrence of the majority of the Justices is necessary to 
decide any question.  Because the Oklahoma Supreme Court is composed of nine members, an opinion must 
receive at least five votes.  Other Justices may write dissenting opinions.  Even if a Justice agrees with the 
result reached by the majority opinion, the Justice may author a concurring, concurring specially, concur-
ring-in-result, or concurring-in-judgment opinion stating the reasons why the law as stated by the majority 
opinion is correct in the cause presented.  If a Justice agrees with the law expressed in an opinion, the vote 
is to concur.  If the Justice disagrees with the law as expressed or applied in an opinion, the vote is a dissent.  
Concurring and concurring specially votes are treated as a full concurrence and may be counted in obtaining 
a majority vote.  Concurring in result and concurring in judgment votes may not be counted as votes to form 
a majority opinion.

An opinion issued by the Court is a product of many hours of in-depth, detailed study and research.  These 
opinions and orders are handed down each Tuesday and appear on the Supreme Court website at www.oscn.
net.  Copies are mailed to the attorneys.  Parties dissatisfied with the Court’s opinion may file a petition for 
rehearing within 20 days, requesting the Court to take a second look at the law or the reasoning used in sup-
port of the result reached.  Once an opinion has been issued, copies are available to the general public in the 
Office of the Court Clerk and online at www.oscn.net.  After an opinion is adopted it becomes legal prec-
edent, and guides lawyers, litigants, and judges in future cases.

When an issue is particularly novel or of great importance, the Court may order the parties to appear for 
oral argument.  Generally, each side will be given 30 minutes to present its case.  This time may be divided 
between the original argument and rebuttal.  Later, at a private conference, the Justices discuss the argu-
ments presented, and the Justice originally assigned the case will author a proposed opinion.  This proposed 
opinion, like all others, is considered by all nine Justices and voted upon in conference.

The Supreme Court and the Judicial System

The historic and primary focus of the Supreme Court is to decide civil appellate cases.  However, the Court 
has additional duties of equal importance.  The Court, pursuant to art. 7, §4 of the Oklahoma Constitu-
tion, has administrative responsibility for the entire Oklahoma judicial system.  The Court establishes the 
rules for all courts in Oklahoma.  The Supreme Court is developing and implementing a statewide uniform 
case management system for the appellate and district courts of Oklahoma.  Oklahoma has a unified bar.  
Membership in the Oklahoma Bar Association is required in order to practice law in Oklahoma.  The Court 
sets the rules for admission to the bar and for the ethical practice of law; the Court administers appropriate 
discipline in cases of attorney misconduct.  In recent years, the Supreme Court has been vested with further 
responsibilities by the legislature, including appeals of expungement orders, decisions of the Oklahoma Se-
curities Commission, victim protective orders, original and exclusive jurisdiction over bond approvals and 
final orders on the nonpayment of child support.

The Oklahoma Supreme Court works closely with the federal judiciary.  The Court is often called upon to 
answer federal certified questions pursuant to the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, 20 O.S. 
2011 §1601, et seq.  Certified questions are issues raised in a federal case for which there is no Oklahoma 
law, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court is called upon to settle the issue.

Additionally, many of the Justices make personal appearances to speak to members of the Bar, civic clubs, 
and educational groups.  These appearances are made in an attempt to help all citizens understand the 
Court’s workings and to inform them of the decision-making process.  The Justices often administer official 
oaths of office to public officials.  Justices frequently give tours of the Oklahoma Judicial Center.

Pursuant to the Okla. Const., art. 7, §§1, 2, the Court selects from its members a Chief Justice and a Vice 
Chief Justice.  The Court selects a new Chief Justice every two years.  The Chief Justice, who is the first 
among equals, presides at all court sessions, and chairs the state judicial conference.  The Okla. Const. art. 7, 
§5 vests general administrative authority over all courts in the state in the Supreme Court.  The Chief Justice
administers the judicial branch of state government in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court and
represents the Court and judicial system in public appearances.  The Vice Chief Justice’s term of office is
coextensive with that of the Chief Justice.

Ethics Advisory Panel

The Judicial Ethics Advisory Panel serves as an entity to which questions concerning judicial ethics may 
be addressed.  Requests may relate solely to prospective conduct which the petitioning party is concerned 
may violate the Code of Judicial Conduct.  The panel issues advisory opinions which address only whether 
an intended future course of conduct is in violation of the Code.  The Advisory Panel is staffed by five 
retired judges who have shown the highest of ethical standards, integrity, and wisdom through their service 
as members of the judiciary and as public servants.  Currently, the members are Edward Cunningham, Bill 
Hetherington, April Sellers White, Tom Landrith, and Allen McCall.

Members of the Oklahoma judiciary and their staff are governed by very strict rules of ethical conduct 
called the Code of Judicial Conduct.  Judicial officers are charged with maintaining the integrity and inde-
pendence of the judiciary.  No Justice or Judge may lend the prestige of the office to advance any private 
interest.  They must refrain from participation in political activities.  They may not hold offices in political 
organizations, make speeches for political organizations or candidates, or solicit funds for a political orga-
nization or make, directly or indirectly, contributions to political organizations or candidates.  A Justice or 
Judge on a retention ballot may campaign only if there is active opponent opposition to retention.

Continuing Legal Education

The Oklahoma Supreme Court is committed to Continuing Legal Education (CLE) for judges and lawyers.  
Making great use of the restored auditorium in the Oklahoma Judicial Center, the Court, in cooperation 
with the Oklahoma Bar Association, has implemented a free movie night for judges and lawyers to provide 
CLE credit.  A law related movie is shown, followed by a scholarly discussion of legal issues relating to the 
movie which is led by one of the Justices or Judges.  

The Court has implemented mandatory judicial education. Judges are required to obtain at least twelve 
(12) hours of judicial education per year.  Judicial education is offered at various locations and at Judicial
Conferences conducted by the Administrative Office of the Courts. The Administrative Office of the Courts
administers the Oklahoma Court Improvement Program (CIP).  CIP works to provide improved safety, per-
manence and well-being outcomes for Oklahoma’s deprived children through efficient court practices and
computer technology. The goals of CIP include allowing courts to address fundamental problems by improv-
ing legal and judicial training and developing and improving court data systems.

Access to Justice Commission

The Oklahoma Supreme Court created the Oklahoma Access to Justice Commission by order of then Chief 
Justice Tom Colbert on March 13, 2014.  The creation of the commission was to develop and implement 
policy initiatives designed to expand access to and enhance the quality of justice in civil legal matters for 
low-income Oklahoma residents.  The Commission is to serve as an umbrella organization for all efforts to 
expand access to justice in civil matters in Oklahoma.  Nationally, Oklahoma joins approximately 38 other 
states with active Access to Justice Commissions.

Currently, M. David Riggs of the Tulsa law firm Riggs, Abney serves as chairman of the commission, cur-
rently comprised of  12 members;  Attorney M. David Riggs, Chairman, Chief Justice Combs, President 
Howard G. Barnett, Jr., Oklahoma State University Tulsa, Attorney Lewis Berkowitz, District Judge Aletia 
Timmons, Associate District Judge Rick Bozarth, Director of the Lobeck-Taylor Family Advocacy Clinic 
Anna Carpenter, University of Tulsa, Attorney Tricia Everest, Michael Figgins of Legal Aid of Oklahoma, 
Neal A. McCaleb of the Chickasaw Nation, Attorney Ethan Shaner, and Former Speaker of The Oklahoma 
House of Representatives Kris Steele.  The Commission also includes appointees of the President Pro-Tem 
of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives which are vacant.

Supreme Court Language Access

The Oklahoma Supreme Court and the State Board of Examiners of Certified Courtroom Interpreters offi-
cially launched the Court Interpreter Program in the spring of 2015.   The purpose of this program is to help 
the public and the Oklahoma courts locate and provide qualified spoken-language interpreters, and to ensure 
equal access to justice for all individuals regardless of their ability to communicate in the spoken English 
language.  What began with 18 newly-enrolled Registered Courtroom Interpreters now includes 38 speaking 
German, Mandarin Chinese, Persian Farsi, and Spanish.  The Registry of Registered Courtroom Interpreters 
is available on the Courtroom Interpreter section of OSCN.  A registered Courtroom Interpreter in Oklaho-
ma is then eligible to take the oral examination to become a Certified Courtroom Interpreter.  Certification as 
a court interpreter indicates the highest skill level and tests the intepreter in all three modes of court inter-
preting (consecutive, simultaneous, and sight translation).  Currently, there are 8 Certified Interpreters listed 
on the Supreme Court’s Registry of Certified Interpreters.  There are also 22 Provisional Foreign Language 
Interpreters which also speak Arabic, and Vietnamese laguages in addition to the other languages listed.

Oklahoma Judicial Nominating Commission 

The Oklahoma Judicial Nominating Commission (JNC) was established in 1967, by an amendment to the 
Oklahoma Constitution. Prompted by the Oklahoma Supreme Court scandal of the early 1960’s, the creation 
of the JNC was part of a nationwide reform movement, begun in Missouri in l940, toward the merit selec-
tion, rather than the election, of some or all judges. The JNC, which went into operation in 1969, nominates 
candidates for appointment by the Governor to fill judicial vacancies. 

The JNC has fifteen members who serve without compensation. Six of the members are lawyers, one elected 
by the members of the bar from each of the six congressional districts as they existed in 1967. The six law-
yers are elected for six year terms, staggered at two year intervals. 

Nine members are nonlawyers. Six are appointed by the Governor, one from each of the “old” congressional 
districts, to serve staggered six year terms. Of the six members named by the Governor, not more than three 
can belong to any one political party and none can have a lawyer from any state in their immediate family. 
The three remaining nonlawyer members serve a two year term as Members At-Large. One is appointed by 
the Senate President Pro Tempore, one is appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and one 
is selected by the other members of the Commission. Of the three At-Large members, not more than two can 
be from the same political party.  The JNC annually elects one of its members to serve as chairman for a one 
year term. 

The JNC was designed to be as free from partisan influence as possible. Besides limiting the number of lay 
members who may belong to any one political party, the Constitution provides that no Commissioner can 
hold any other public office by election or appointment or any official position in a political party.  No Com-
missioner is eligible, while a member of the Commission and for five years thereafter, for nomination as a 
Judicial Officer.  Nor may a Commissioner succeed himself or herself. The current members are: 

Attorneys Elected by the Lawyers in their 
District: Melissa DeLacerda, Michael C. Mordy, 
Deborah Reheard, Peggy Stockwell, John H. 
Tucker, and Jim Webb .

Lay Members Appointed by the Governor: Ed 
Crocker, Lee Evans, D.B. Green, David Hudi-
burg, Gill Luton, and Steve Turnbo. 
At-Large Elected by Commission: Dr. Jim 
Miller. 
At-Large Appointed by Senate President Pro 
Tempore: Daryl Woodard
At-Large Appointed by Speaker of the House 
of Representatives: Ronny Eaves

Board of Judicial Compensation

Judicial salaries are determined by the Board of Judicial Compensation which is codified in 20 O.S. 2011 
§§ 20-3.1-3.4.  Every odd numbered year, the Board meets to review the compensation paid to members of
the state judiciary and, if necessary, recommend changes.  It considers other states, the region, the value of
services in the private sector, compensation of attorneys in the private and public sectors, compensation of
other state, county, and municipal officials, and changes to the cost of living.

The Board is comprised of seven members from various fields such as labor and civic organizations, com-
munications media, retail business, manufacturing and professional fields, and agriculture.  No more than 
four members are allowed to be from the same political party.  Two members appointed by the President 
Pro Tempore of the Senate, two members by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, two members by 
the Governor, and one member by the Chief Justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court.  The current board is 
comprised of: 

Appointed by Speaker of the House:

William W. “Bill” Frankfurt, III

Appointed by President Pro Tempore of the

The Sovereignty Symposium  www.thesovereigntysymposium.com

In addition to providing free CLE, the Supreme Court and The Sovereignty Symposium, Inc., sponsor The 
Sovereignty Symposium annually.  This gathering is recognized as the premier conference in the country on 
Indian Law.  The curriculum features comprehensive coverage of legal issues involving indigenous peoples.  
Lectures and open discussions leave attendees, as well as the bench and practicing bar, with a better un-
derstanding of the historical perspective and the contemporary legal issues facing tribal, state, and federal 
governments.  The Sovereignty Symposium was established to provide a forum in which ideas concerning 
common legal issues could be exchanged in a scholarly, non-adversarial environment.  The Supreme Court 
espouses no view on any of the issues, and the positions taken by the participants are not endorsed by the 
Court.  The Ed Edmondson Scholarship ensures participation for those who wish to attend; the Chief Justice 
John B. Doolin Writing Competition awards a cash prize for the best student papers; the Susan J. Ferrell 
Scholarship is an all expense paid scholarship awarded on merit; and the Hargrave Prize recognizes the best 
faculty paper.  The current Board is comprised of Allison Cave, President, Julie Rorie, Judge Aletia Tim-

The Sovereignty Symposium Color Guards

The Kiowa Black Leggings Society Honor Guard (Ton-Kon-Gah), 
was re-established in 1958 to honor veterans.  Gus Palmer, with his 
brothers George and Dixon, revived the Kiowa military society tradi-
tion to honor their brother Lyndreth, who was killed in battle during 
WWII.  The Black Leggings have presented the United States and 
Oklahoma flags at each Soveriegnty Symposium, since in 1988.

Black Leggings regalia remains unchanged.  A black string shawl is 
worn at the waist.  Legs are covered with black paint or black leg-
gings from the knees down, and a cape is draped over the shoulders.  
The cape is worn in honor of Gool-hay-ee, Palmer’s great-grandfa-
ther, who killed a Mexican officer in battle and took his cape as a war 
trophy.  The Black Leggings Society still has possession of the origi-
nal cape.  Members also carry a decorated lance or spear.  The adorn-
ment is a personal statement of individual military experience.  Gus 
Palmer had 21 eagle feathers on his lance, representing the 21 bomb-
ing missions he made during 
WWII.  Ton-Kon-Gah members 
have served in every major 
United States conflict.

Dixon Palmer, a member of the Black Leggings for 52 years, was 
born in a tipi on his grandmother’s allotment just west of Anadarko.  
He served with the 45th Infantry Division in WWII, logging 511 days 
in combat earning two Silver Stars, and three Bronze Stars.

He was a National Champion War Dancer who also gained world 
renown for his skill in making war bonnets, including those worn by 
the Black Leggings.  

All original Black Leggings members have received the Sovereignty 
Symposium Honored One medal.  Dixon was honored individually, 
and was the subject of Mike Larsen’s 2009 poster.

Talker.  He earned the World War II Victory Medal and the 
European Theater of Operations Victory Medal with five 
Bronze Stars, and the Chevalier de l’Ordre National du 
Mérite by the French Government.  In 1999, he received 
the Knowlton Award from the Military Intelligence Corps 
Association, and in 2005, he was the Honored One for The 
Sovereignty Symposium.  The Navajo Code Talkers were 
honored in 1993, and the Chickasaw Astronaut, Command-
er John Herrington, was recognized in 2006.

The Vietnam Era Color Guard honored The Symposium 
with its presence from 1989 - 2014.  Pictured with Justice

United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O’Connor (ret.) returned to The Sovereignty 
Symposium to speak for the third time in 2013.  Since retiring from the Court, Justice O’Connor devotes 
her time to restoring civic lessons in the lives of school children throughout the United States, and to the 
promotion of an independent judiciary.  In 2009, she founded iCivics to reverse Americans’ declining civic 
knowledge and participation.  Securing our democracy, she realized, requires teaching the next generation to 
understand and respect our system of governance.  Embracing technology, iCivics has been instrumental in 
developing civics lessons through video and online games, making the information fun to learn.  The na-
tion’s most comprehensive, standards-aligned civics curriculum is free on the Web at www.icivics.org.

In the fall of 2014, United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor came to Oklahoma to 
meet, at her request, with Oklahoma Tribal Leaders at the Oklahoma Judicial Center.  Her visit included 
stops at Oklahoma City University Law School, Tulsa University College of Law and the University of 
Oklahoma College of Law.  An honorary luncheon provided by The Soveriegnty Symposium was held in 
her honor and she personally met every person in attendance and addressed the group in a short luncheon 
program.  Pictured below is Justice Sotomayor with the Oklahoma’s Tribal Leaders in attendance.

The Ralph B. Hodges — Robert E. Lavender Award of Judicial Excellence

In 2012, the Oklahoma Supreme Court inaugurated the Ralph B. Hodges – Robert E. Lavender Award for 
Judicial Excellence.  They were appointed to the Court in 1965 by Governor Henry Bellmon in the wake of 
the Oklahoma Supreme Court scandals of the 1960’s.  They restored the honor, dignity and credibility of the 
Oklahoma Supreme Court.  Justice Hodges was the youngest man ever to serve on the Court.  He was the 
recipient of the Media and Society Award given by the H.H. Herbert School of Journalism and Mass Com-
munications for his efforts to allow cameras and microphones into Oklahoma courtrooms and he was named 
Appellate Justice of the year in 1976.  Justice Lavender served on the Court for forty-two years, longer than 
any Justice.  He was recognized as a distinguished alumnus of the University of Tulsa.

2015 Court of Criminal Appeals  Judge Charles John-

2016  Court of Civil Appeals Judge Keith Rapp
2017  Supreme Court Justice Steven Taylor

In carrying out its work, the Supreme Court is assisted by staff

Each Justice is authorized to hire two full-time lawyers and one administrative assistant.  The clerical sup-
port staff is responsible for handling the individual Justice’s calendars, preparing the dockets for Monday 
and Thursday Conferences, circulating proposed opinions and orders, and numerous other office duties.  The 
Justice’s Judicial Assistants are highly qualified career lawyers who aid the Justice in researching and draft-
ing proposed opinions.  Occasionally, legal interns assist the various chambers and receive law school credit 
for the semester.

In addition to the regular staff, a central staff also assists the Chief Justice.  Central staff consists of a Court 
Marshal, four referees with two administrative assistants, and a Court receptionist.  The Court Clerk is also 
part of this central staff, although the Clerk also serves the entire Court as well. Currently, one of the ref-
erees also acts as the Court’s Marshal and is often called upon by lawyers to answer procedural questions.  
The Chief’s office, through the assistance of staff acts as the Court’s record-keeper for the number and kinds 
of cases that the Court handles each year, and drafts and issues orders as directed by the Court.   The refer-
ees, all attorneys, evaluate hundreds of petitions for certiorari and they are called upon to conduct oral argu-
ments and hearings which are not appropriate for hearing by the entire Court.

The Clerk of the Supreme Court

Pursuant to the Okla. Const. art. 7, §5 “the Supreme Court appoints the Clerk of the Supreme Court who 
serves at the pleasure of the Supreme Court and who performs the duties mandated by law and by the rules 
of the Supreme Court.”  The Clerk attends all sessions of the Court held in the Courtroom, calls the Court 
to session, maintains official hearing records, operates recording and timing equipment, and ensures that 
proper courtroom procedures are observed.  The Clerk is the Court’s record-keeper.  The Clerk maintains 
operational contact with the parties and attorneys for all cases.  The Clerk’s office is the repository for all 
filings made in connection with any case.  The Clerk also serves as the Clerk of the Court of Criminal Ap-
peals, the Court of Civil Appeals, the Court of the Judiciary, and the Court of Tax Review.

The Administrative Director of the Courts and staff, under supervision of the Chief Justice and the Court, 
coordinate judicial operations and personnel throughout the state handling payroll, training, data systems, 
research and other responsibilities.  Additionally, the Administrative Office of the Courts provides leadership 
and administrative support for the Judicial Nominating Commission, the Oklahoma Children’s Court Im-
provment Program, Board of Certified Interpreters and the recently established Oklahoma Access to Justice

The Oklahoma Supreme Court and www.oscn.net

The Oklahoma Supreme Court established the “Oklahoma Supreme Court Network” (OSCN), an internet-
based service designed to provide the public and the Bar with access to the public legal documents of the 
state of Oklahoma.

OSCN is now one of the largest freely available repositories of legal information on the Internet.  OSCN is 
widely used as an information source.  On average over 700,000 pages are viewed daily by users from all 
walks of life.  In addition to the legal community, the media as well as business and private entities benefit 
from the infromation data provided by OSCN at no cost to the public.  Thousands of published Oklahoma 
appellate cases are available on the web site, as well as the Oklahoma Statutes.  Attorney General’s opin-
ions, certiorari dispositions, court rules, forms, and many other types of documents are also included.

OSCN provides a fielded search system for all of the documents within its databases, similar to that offered 
by such vendors as Westlaw or Lexis.  OSCN also provides a service entitled “The Citationizer” for tracking 
and checking citations to case law, similar to services provided by Shepard’s.  Finally, OSCN provides same 
day new decision service for the Oklahoma Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals.

Oklahoma’s move to public domain citation and web publication of documents has generated a great deal 
of positive feedback, both from the Bar and the public at large.  The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City’s 
daily newspaper, ran an in-depth front page article on OSCN, and the Court’s actions have been covered by 
numerous publications, including Cnet.com, The National Law Journal, and The Journal Record.  The Court 
has received the “Site Patrol” Award from Microsoft.com, “Best of the Net” Award from the Mining Co., 
and OSCN is listed as a “well done court site” at Courts.net.  The address for OSCN is http://www.oscn.net.

Judges of the District Court

The majority of the judiciary in Oklahoma is composed of Judges of the District Court.  Often these Judges 
serve as the first contact a party may have with the judicial system.  District Court Judges hear both civil and 
criminal matters, and they are the backbone of the judiciary.  Appeals from the District Courts in civil mat-
ters are considered by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.  Appeals in criminal matters from the District Courts 
are considered by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.

Nine Presiding Judges are elected by their peers to assist in the administration of Oklahoma’s trial courts.  
These judges, representing separate geographic areas, meet monthly with members of the Supreme Court 
and Court of Criminal Appeals to discuss the administration of justice and any developments affecting Okla-
homa’s judiciary.  These meetings provide an effective forum for exchanging information by and between 
the trial judges and appellate judges.

New Judges

The new Judges’ Orientation is the foundation for the ongoing judicial education provided to the members 
of the Oklahoma Judicial Conference. The four-day course offers twenty-six credit hours of preparation for 
managing civil and criminal proceedings from both trial and appellate court perspectives. The new judges 
also learn about their administrative duties, docket management strategies, and how and where to seek guid-
ance regarding judicial ethics. Keeping well-educated judges on the bench is the goal of Judicial Education.

Oklahoma Court Clerks

Oklahoma has seventy-seven elected court clerks, one in each county.  The Court Clerk is an officer of the 
court; the duties of the Court Clerk are ministerial in nature. The Court Clerk is statutorily responsible under 
28 O.S. 2011 §151 for the collection of all fees, costs, and assessments that are properly owed to the District 
Courts of Oklahoma. The Court Clerks are the keepers and custodians of the records of the District Courts.  
They are currently at the forefront of the creation and implementation of the unified case management sys-
tem for all Oklahoma Courts.

Artists and the Oklahoma Judicial Center 

The large majority of the artwork in the Judicial Center, about sixty-five percent, was already in storage at 
the Oklahoma Historical Society.  The new artwork obtained for the Judicial Center was commissioned or 
purchased from a coterie of superb Oklahoma artists.  Many of the artists donated their work, or provided 
it at a cost much less than their standard fees.  The collection continues to grow.  In 2017, we received two 
incredible paintings from Eric Tippeconnic and Poteet Victory.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
