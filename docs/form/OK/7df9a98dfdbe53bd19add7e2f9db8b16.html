and  Certified  Courtroom  Interpreters,  and  the  general  administration  of  Oklahoma  courtroom 
interpreter credentials, shall be under the direction and control of the Oklahoma State Board of 
Examiners of Certified Courtroom Interpreters (hereinafter "the Board"). Pursuant to Section 1702 
of Title 20 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the following Rules are adopted. 

he Board designates and authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts to 
receive  and  accept  on  behalf  of  the  Board  any  notice,  submission  or  other  correspondence 
referenced in these rules. 

Effective January 12, 2015) 

ule 2.  

Levels of Courtroom Interpreter Credentials 

he following levels of courtroom interpreter certifications are hereby recognized in the Oklahoma 
courts:  Certified Courtroom Interpreters and Registered Courtroom Interpreters. In addition, the 
Board may maintain a list of Provisional Status Interpreters as provided below. 
 

a)  A “Certified Courtroom Interpreter” (also referred to herein as a “Certified Interpreter”) 
is a foreign language interpreter who has achieved certification – the highest credential 
for courtroom interpreting in Oklahoma -- pursuant to the requirements of these Rules, 
and who holds a current certification status with the Board. 
 

1)  Certified  Interpreters  are  identified  on  the  Oklahoma  Courtroom  Interpreter 
registry which is  maintained  by the  Administrative Office of the Courts and 
which may be posted on the Supreme Court’s website. 

2)  An interpreter certified pursuant to these Rules is qualified to act as a courtroom 
interpreter in both translation of written text and interpretation of spoken words 
in the language certified. 

b)  A  “Registered  Courtroom  Interpreter”  (also  referred  to  herein  as  a  “Registered 
Interpreter”) is a foreign language interpreter who has not achieved certification, but 
has met the professional  competency standards set forth in these Rules, and who holds 
a  current  registration  status  with  the  Board.  Registered  Interpreters  hold  the  second 
highest credential for courtroom interpreting in Oklahoma.

1)  Registered Interpreters are identified on the Oklahoma Courtroom Interpreter 
registry  which  is  maintained  by  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts  and 
which may be posted on the Supreme Court’s website. 

)  An interpreter who has achieved the status of Registered Courtroom Interpreter 
pursuant  to  these  Rules is  qualified  to  act  as  a  courtroom  interpreter  in  both 
translation of written text and interpretation of spoken words in the language 
certified when a Certified Courtroom Interpreter is not available.

c)  A  “Provisional  Status  Interpreter”  (also  referred  to  herein  as  a  “Provisional 
Interpreter”)  is  a  foreign  language  interpreter  who  has  not  achieved  certification  or 
registration  but  has  met  certain  minimum  verified  requirements  as  previously 
authorized by the Supreme Court in its Interim Rules previously promulgated by Order 
No. SCAD 2014-31 (2014 OK 45).  Provisional Interpreters do not possess an official 
certification  and  have  not  achieved  the  higher  levels  of  training  and  qualifications 
required of Registered and Certified Interpreters. 
 

1)  To qualify for provisional status, candidates shall meet the general requirements 
for  eligibility,  as  provided  in  Rule  3  below,  and  shall  meet  the  following 
requirements, to the satisfaction of the Board: 

 

)  Complete an application form, 
b)  Pass a background check, 
c)  Pay an application fee in the amount of $100.00, 
d)  Agree in writing to comply with the Code of Professional Responsibility 

for Interpreters in the Oklahoma Courts, and 

e)  Possess one or more of the following: 

i.  A four (4) year college degree majoring in the language for which 
provisional status is requested (the applicant’s academic major must 
be the foreign language to be interpreted), 

ii.  Provisional  status,  or  a  similar  credential  from  another  state  court 
which,  in  the  discretion  of  the  Board,  establishes  the  candidate  is 
qualified for provisional status in Oklahoma, or 

iii.  Experience  providing  professional 

the 
courtroom setting which, in the discretion of the Board, establishes 
that the candidate is qualified for provisional status.

in 

2)  Provisional Interpreters are listed on the active Provisional Interpreter registry 
which is maintained by the Administrative Office of the Courts and which may 
be posted on the Supreme Court’s website. 

3)  Subject to the provisions of 20 O.S. §1710, a Provisional Interpreter may act 
as a courtroom interpreter in both translation of written text and interpretation 
of  spoken  words  only  when  a  Certified  or  Registered  Interpreter  is  not 
available. 

4)  The purpose of the interim provisional-status process is to assist the Oklahoma 
courts  in  providing  qualified  language  interpreters  while  Oklahoma’s 
courtroom  interpreter  credentialing  program  is  under  development.  It  is 

  a

intended  that  the  granting  of  the  provisional  status  credential  shall  be 
superseded by the Board’s permanent credentialing process when it becomes 
available. The Board, in its discretion, may recommend that the Supreme Court 
stop accepting applications for provisional status in one or more languages at 
any time. The Board shall cease accepting provisional status applications when 
an Oklahoma registration or certification credential becomes available in that 
language. 

5)  An interpreter with provisional status shall be required to achieve an Oklahoma 
interpreter credential (Oklahoma registration or  certification) within two (2) 
years  from  the  date  the  Board  first  offers  Oklahoma  credentialing  in  that 
language (in most instances, this will be two (2) years from the date the Board 
first offers the written interpreter exam and basic proficiency assessment for 
applicants  seeking  credentialing  in  that  language).  If  the  interpreter  fails  to 
achieve Oklahoma registration or certification as required by this paragraph, 
his or her provisional status shall expire automatically, without further action 
of the Board, and the interpreter’s name shall be  removed from the registry 
maintained by the Administrative Office of the Courts. An interpreter who fails 
to  achieve  Oklahoma  registration  or  certification  within  the  time  period 
required by this paragraph may not re-apply for further provisional status. 
If approved by the Board, a Provisional Status Interpreter may receive a one-
time credit in the amount paid for his or her provisional application fee, to be 
applied to the fees required for Oklahoma registration or certification. 

6) 

7)  The  Board  may  recommend  that  the  Supreme  Court  remove  a  Provisional 
Status  Interpreter  from  the  registry  if  the  Board,  in  its  sole  discretion, 
determines  that  such  action  would  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  courts.  The 
Board may recommend that the Supreme Court discontinue maintaining the 
list of Provisional Status Interpreters in one or more languages if the Board 
determines that such action would be in the best interest of the courts. 

8)  Use of an interpreter with provisional status shall not suppress the mandatory 

audio recording requirement in 20 O.S. §1710. 

2)  Submit to the Board properly completed application forms, accompanied by such 
evidence,  statements  or  documents  as  are  required  by  the  Board,  along  with 
payment of the fees required by the Board and approved by the Supreme Court. 

)  Prove to the satisfaction of the Board that he/she is: 

of legal age; 
meets the requisite standards of ethical fitness; and 
has at least a high school education, or the equivalent thereof; and

Credentialing 

for  Oklahoma  Courtroom 

Interpreter 

a)  The  court  interpreter  credentialing  process  developed  by  the  National  Center  for  State 
Courts  (hereinafter  the  "NCSC")  is  widely  recognized  as  the  industry  standard  for 
certification of courtroom interpreters by state courts, and the best interest of the Oklahoma 
courts  requires  a  credentialing  process  which  is  in  line  with  the  nationally  recognized 
interpreter  certification  standards.  Such  an  approach  will  better  equip  Oklahoma  to 
participate in national language access initiatives, including Video Remote Interpretation 
(VRI),  a  national  database  of  certified  interpreters,  and  reciprocal  recognition  of 
certifications  granted  by  other  state  courts.  Accordingly,  the  certification  of  spoken 
language  interpreters  in  the  Oklahoma  courts  shall  be  based  upon  the  credentialing 
examinations  and  standards  approved  by  the  NCSC  (also  known  as  the Consortium  for 
Language Access in the Courts) and any subsequent versions of those examinations and 
standards as the NCSC may approve from time to time. 

b)  To  satisfy  the  oral  examination  requirements  specified  in  20  O.S.  §1703(B)(Part  1)  the 
Board  shall  administer  the  NCSC  Court  Interpreter  Oral  Examination  for  the  language 
being  certified.  To  satisfy  the  written  examination  requirements  specified  in  20  O.S. 
§1703(B)(Part  2  and  Part  3),  the  Board  shall  administer  the  NCSC  Court  Interpreter 
Written Examination in its entirety, which shall satisfy the requirements of both Part 2 and 
Part 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board shall not require candidates 
to achieve scores on either the oral or written exam which are higher than the passing scores 
generally recognized by the NCSC.

a)  A person enrolled in good standing as a Certified or Registered Courtroom Interpreter may 
apply  to  the  Board  to  have  his/her  certificate  placed  in  voluntary  inactive  status.  Such 
application  must  be  in  writing,  in  letter  form,  and  submitted  to  the  office  of  the 
Administrative Director of the Courts. 

b)  To qualify for inactive status, an interpreter's certificate must be current. Unless waived by 
the  Board,  a  payment  of  any  accrued  certificate  renewal  fee,  delinquent  payment  fee, 
continuing  education  penalty  fee,  or  continuing  education  suspension  fee  must  be 
submitted with the application for inactive status. If the interpreter's certificate is current 
and in good standing, no fee is required to apply for inactive status. 

c)  Qualifying applications for voluntary inactive status may be granted without formal action 

by the Board. 

d)  The Board shall deny a request to place an interpreter in inactive status if there are any 
current or pending complaints or formal disciplinary actions against the interpreter, or if 
the interpreter's certificate is revoked or suspended pursuant to formal disciplinary action. 

e)  An interpreter who holds an inactive certificate  will be exempt from certificate renewal 
fees and continuing education requirements. However, the holder of an inactive certificate 
may not engage in the practice of courtroom interpreting in Oklahoma. 

f)  An interpreter who holds an inactive certificate may apply to the Board to have his or her 
certificate reinstated to active status within twelve (12) months from the date on which the 
inactive status became effective. Such reinstatement application must be in writing, in letter 
form, and submitted to the office of the Administrative Director of the Courts, and shall be 
accompanied by the following, unless waived by the Board: 

1) Payment of an amount equal to the annual certificate renewal fee; and 
2) Payment of a reinstatement fee, in an amount to be determined by the Board and 

approved by the Supreme Court.

g)  Interpreters  may  not  use  inactive  status  in  order  to  avoid  continuing  education 
requirements.  Unless  waived  by  the  Board,  any  interpreter  seeking  reinstatement  from 
inactive status who failed to meet the continuing education requirements applicable during 
his or her final year as an active interpreter must provide proof of completion of eight (8) 
hours of continuing education within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the 
date of reinstatement request. 

h)  Unless an exception is granted by the Board, an interpreter whose certificate has been in 
inactive  status  for  more  than  twelve  (12)  months  is  not  eligible  for  reinstatement  as 
provided in this Rule, and must pass the examinations and other certification requirements 
provided  in  the  statutes  and  rules  applicable  to  Registered  and  Certified  Courtroom 
Interpreters. 

he Board may send any notices required by these rules and other official communications via 
email  if  the  interpreter  has  provided  an  email  address  to  the  Board  for  such  purposes.  Email 
correspondence from the Board shall be sent to the last known email address of the interpreter as 
provided to the Secretary of the Board or the Administrative Office of the Courts. It shall be the 
responsibility of the interpreter to notify the Board regarding any change of email address. 

he members of the Board, the Administrative Director of the Courts, the Administrative Office 
of the Courts, and their agents and employees who participate in the implementation of these Rules 
and  the  administration  of  Oklahoma's  Certified  Courtroom  Interpreter  program,  shall  be 
considered as acting officially as an arm of the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma, and shall 
enjoy immunity from civil liability to the fullest extent recognized by federal and state law.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
