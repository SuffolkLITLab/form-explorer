the  interpreter  will  not  properly  discharge  the  responsibilities  of  a  certified  courtroom 
interpreter; 

1)  As used in this Rule, "criminal offense" shall include, but is not limited to i) any felony, 
ii) any lesser crime that reflects adversely on the interpreter's honesty, trustworthiness 
or fitness to practice court interpreting, and/or iii) any crime a necessary element of 
which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of the crime, involves 
interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, 
deceit,  bribery,  extortion,  misappropriation,  theft,  or  an  attempt,  conspiracy  or 
solicitation of another to commit a such an offense. 

2)  As used in this Rule, a final conviction includes a plea of guilty or nolo contendere 
pursuant  to  a  deferred  sentence  plea  agreement,  a  verdict  or  finding  of  guilt,  or 
pronouncement of sentence by a trial court  even though  that  conviction may  not be 
final or sentence may not be actually imposed until all appeals are exhausted. 

b)  The misrepresentation of any fact in obtaining certification; 
c)  Any  violation  of,  or  noncompliance  with  any  rule  or  directive  of  the  Supreme  Court, 
including but not limited to the Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in the 
Oklahoma Courts;

ule 4. 

Complaints 

a)  The  procedure  for  filing  a  complaint  against  a  Certified  Courtroom  Interpreter  or  a 
Registered  Courtroom  Interpreter  and  the  investigation  of  such  complaint  shall  be  as 
follows: 
 

1)  The Board shall furnish forms for a request for investigation to each person who 
alleges misconduct of an interpreter. Each complaint shall be in writing, although 
not necessarily in the prescribed form, and signed by the complainant. A complaint 
may be filed by any person, including another interpreter, who has knowledge or 
information of misconduct of an interpreter. The Board may initiate a complaint 
upon its own motion. 
 

2)  A complaint shall be filed with the Secretary of the Board, who shall transmit copies 
to all members of the Board. The Board shall conduct preliminary investigation to 
determine  whether  there  are  facts  sufficient  to  warrant  formal  disciplinary 
proceedings. 

i)  The Board may solicit additional information from the complainant. 
ii)  The Board may interview or subpoena potential witnesses. 
iii)  The Board shall inform the interpreter involved of the nature of the complaint 

and afford the interpreter an opportunity to respond thereto in writing. 

 

3)  At the discretion of the Board, in order to speed the consideration and determination 
of  complaints  and  controversies  which  may  not  justify  or  require  more  formal 
proceedings, the Board may hold an informal conference with the party or parties 
affected.  Thereafter  the  Board  as  a  body,  or  any  designated  member,  or 
representative  thereof,  shall  attempt  to  resolve  the  controversy  in  an  equitable 
manner.  Such  proceedings  shall  be  without  prejudice  to  the  right  of  the  Board 

  (

    R

  A

  (

    R

 

thereafter to conduct formal disciplinary proceedings covering the same or related 
subject matter as set forth in Rule 5 and Rule 6 herein. 
 

4)  Should the Board determine that formal disciplinary proceedings are not warranted, 
the  complainant  and  the  interpreter  involved  shall  be  promptly  notified  of  such 
determination by the Secretary of the Board. Such determination may be appealed 
by the complainant by filing a Petition for Review with the Clerk of the Supreme 
Court not more than thirty (30) days from the date of the Board's decision. Such 
petition shall be processed by the Court as in other appeals from recommendations 
of the Board as hereinafter provided. 

5)  Should the Board determine that formal disciplinary proceedings are warranted, the 
Secretary of the Board shall prepare a formal complaint, as set forth in Rule 5. 

b)  The  procedure  for  filing  a  complaint  against  a  Provisional  Status  Interpreter  and  the 

investigation of such complaint shall be as follows: 
 

1)  The Board shall furnish forms for a request for investigation to each person who 
alleges misconduct of a Provisional Status Interpreter. Each complaint shall be in 
writing,  although  not  necessarily  in  the  prescribed  form,  and  signed  by  the 
complainant.  A  complaint  may  be  filed  by  any  person,  including  another 
interpreter,  who  has  knowledge  or  information  of  misconduct  of  a  Provisional 
Status Interpreter. The Board may initiate a complaint upon its own motion. 
 

2)  A complaint shall be filed with the Secretary of the Board, who shall transmit copies 
to all members of the Board. The Board shall conduct an investigation to determine 
whether there are facts sufficient to warrant disciplinary action. 

 

 

 

i)  The Board may solicit additional information from the complainant. 
ii)  The Board may interview or subpoena potential witnesses. 
iii) The Board shall inform the interpreter involved of the nature of the complaint 

and afford the interpreter an opportunity to respond thereto in writing. 

 

3)  Formal disciplinary proceedings are not required in complaints against Provisional 
Status Interpreters. Provisional Status Interpreters are not enrolled, they do not hold 
an official certification, and the amount of time an interpreter may hold provisional 
status is limited as provided in Rule 2(c) of the Rules of Board of Examiners of 
Certified Courtroom Interpreters. 
 

4)  Upon receipt of a complaint regarding a Provisional Status Interpreter, the Board 
may hold an informal conference with the party or parties affected. Thereafter the 
Board as a body, or any designated member, or representative thereof, shall attempt 
to  resolve  the  controversy  in  an  equitable  manner.  Such  proceedings  shall  be 
without prejudice to the right of the Board thereafter to conduct a formal hearing 
covering the same or related subject matter generally following the requirements 
and order of proceedings set forth in Rule 6 herein. 

)  Should  the  Board  determine  that  disciplinary  action  is  not  warranted,  the 
complainant  and  the  interpreter  involved  shall  be  promptly  notified  of  such 
determination by the Secretary of the Board. 

)   Disciplinary  action  against  a  Provisional  Status  Interpreter  shall  consist  of 
immediate removal from the Provisional Interpreter registry and revocation of the 
interpreter's provisional status. The Board may recommend that the Supreme Court 
remove  a  Provisional  Status  Interpreter  from  the  registry  and  revoke  the 
interpreter's provisional status if the Board determines that such action would be in 
the best interest of the courts. 

)  Should the Board determine that removal of a Provisional Status Interpreter from 
the registry is warranted, the Board shall make a  written recommendation to the 
Supreme Court to immediately remove the Provisional Status Interpreter from the 
Provisional  Interpreter  registry,  based  upon  the  information  gathered  during  its 
investigation as provided above. The complainant and the interpreter involved shall 
be promptly notified of such determination by the Secretary of the Board. 

)  Upon  submission  of  the  Board's  recommendation,  the  Board's  recommendation 
shall stand submitted to the Supreme Court which may, in its sole discretion, adopt 
or reject such recommendations in whole or in part, remand with instructions, or 
make  such  other  disposition  as  the  Supreme  Court  may  deem  proper,  with  or 
without  oral  argument  or  formal  written  opinion.  Either  party  aggrieved  by  the 
decision of the Supreme Court may make application for rehearing as provided by 
the Rules of the Supreme Court.

c)  The  Board  shall  obtain  legal  assistance  from  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  in 
investigating and processing complaints and conducting formal disciplinary proceedings, 
reinstatements  after  formal  disciplinary  proceedings,  and  any  appeals  related  to  such 
matters.  The  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  is  authorized  to  provide  counsel  and  legal 
representation to the Board as is necessary to investigate and process complaints and to 
prepare  and  prosecute  formal  disciplinary  proceedings,  reinstatements  after  formal 
disciplinary proceedings, and related appeals authorized by these Rules.

ule 5. 

Formal Proceedings, How Commenced 

a)  Upon an affirmative vote of the Board to commence formal disciplinary proceedings, the 
Secretary of the Board shall prepare a  formal complaint. The formal complaint shall be 
styled: 

BEFORE THE STATE BOARD OF EXAMINERS OF CERTIFIED COURTROOM 
INTERPRETERS 

  (

    R

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The State of Oklahoma ex rel. State Board 
Of Examiners of Certified Courtroom Interpreters, 
Complainant, 

___________________  

 

 

 

 

 

No. 

v. 
(Name of Accused), 
Respondent, 
 

COMPLAINT 

b)  The complaint shall state the specific facts constituting the alleged misconduct, whether 
prior misconduct has resulted in discipline, and whether prior investigations of misconduct 
are to be relied upon to enhance discipline. Any prior acts or conduct relied upon to enhance 
discipline shall be so stated and set forth by specific allegation of fact. The complaint shall 
be attested by the Chairman of the Board. 

c)  Should the complaint allege as grounds for discipline the final conviction of an interpreter, 
in any jurisdiction, of a criminal offense which indicates a clear and rational likelihood that 
the interpreter will not properly discharge his or her duties and responsibilities as a certified 
courtroom interpreter, there shall be attached thereto a certified copy of the indictment or 
information, and a certified copy of the judgment and sentence on a plea of guilty, order 
deferring  judgment  and  sentence,  or  judgment  and  sentence  of  conviction.  Such 
documents,  regardless  of  the  pendency  of  an  appeal,  shall  constitute  the  charge  and  be 
conclusive evidence of the commission of the crime upon which the judgment is based and 
shall suffice as the basis for discipline in accordance with these rules. Thereafter, the issues 
in a formal proceeding shall be limited to whether the conviction demonstrates a clear and 
rational  likelihood  that  the  interpreter  will  not  properly  discharge  his  or  her  duties  and 
responsibilities, and the nature and extent of discipline to be imposed. 

1)  If  an  appeal  is  perfected  from  the  judgment  of  conviction  and  such  judgment  is 
reversed, the disciplinary proceedings based on such conviction shall be dismissed 
immediately and the interpreter involved restored to his/her former status. 
 

2)  Conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to the imposition 
of discipline. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board from initiating and 
conducting formal disciplinary proceedings upon charges identical to those set forth 
in a criminal complaint, indictment, or information, notwithstanding the pendency 
or final disposition of the criminal action. 

d)  The  Secretary  of  the  Board  shall  cause  the  complaint  together  with  notice  of  a  hearing 
before  the  Board  thereon  to  be  sent  to  the  interpreter  involved.  The  hearing  before  the 
Board shall be set no earlier than thirty (30) days from the date of mailing of the complaint 
and notice. The Chairman of the Board may, in his or her discretion, grant continuances 
for good cause known. 
 

e)  Upon receipt of sufficient evidence that an interpreter has engaged in conduct indicating 
that he or she is unfit to practice courtroom interpreting, and where such conduct poses an 
immediate  threat  of  public  harm,  the  Board  may,  in  its  discretion,  request  the  Supreme 
Court to order the immediate interim suspension of that interpreter. In its order of interim 
suspension,  the  Court  shall  direct  the  interpreter  to  appear  before  the  Board  at  a  time 
certain, to show cause why the order of interim suspension should be set aside. Upon good 
cause shown, the Board may request the Court to set aside its order of interim suspension 
when it appears to be in the interest of justice to do so,  with due regard  being given to 
maintaining the integrity of and confidence in the courtroom interpreting profession. 
 

f)  Upon  written request made  not less than fifteen (15) days prior to  the  hearing date, the 
interpreter respondent shall be provided with a list of all witnesses the Board reasonably 
anticipates may be called to testify at the hearing and copies of all documentary evidence 
supporting the allegations of the complaint. These will be provided by Board, or by the 
Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General, not less than ten (10) days prior to the 
hearing date. The interpreter respondent, not less than five (5) days prior to the hearing, 
shall submit a list of all witnesses the respondent anticipates may be called to testify at the 
hearing and all documentary evidence the interpreter intends to introduce as evidence in 
defense of the charges in the complaint or as to mitigation of discipline. The Board may in 
its discretion and for good cause shown modify the time limits herein imposed. 

Effective January 2, 2015) 

ule 6. 

Disciplinary Hearings 

  (

    R

 

a)  The Board, under signature of the Chairperson on behalf of the Board, shall have power to 
issue  subpoenas  to  compel  the  attendance  of  witnesses  on  behalf  of  the  State  or  the 
interpreter involved. 
 

b)  The Chairperson shall preside over formal disciplinary hearings and, if necessary, rule on 
questions  of  procedure.  Disciplinary  hearings  shall  be  conducted  in  an  orderly  manner, 
generally following the order of proceedings in civil matters. However, the formal rules of 
evidence and civil procedure shall not apply to disciplinary hearings before the Board. Any 
evidence  offered  on  behalf  of  the  complainant  or  the  interpreter  respondent  shall  be 
received and considered unless clearly irrelevant to the proceedings. The interpreter shall 
have the right to appear personally or through counsel, cross examine witnesses and present 
evidence on his/her own behalf. The Board or the respondent may request that a complete 
stenographic  record  of  formal  disciplinary  hearings  before  the  Board  be  kept.  The 
complainant shall have the burden of persuasion on the material elements of the complaint. 
Hearings may be adjourned or continued to a date certain as the Board in its discretion shall 
decide. 
 

c)  All disciplinary proceedings before the Board shall be open to the public, except that the 
Board, when acting in its capacity as a quasi-judicial body, may close the meeting to the 
public  for  purposes  of  deliberations  only.  All  votes  of  the  Board  regarding  disciplinary 

matters shall be publicly cast and recorded.  At the discretion of the Chairperson, the Board 
may permit the use of teleconferencing and videoconferencing technology in any stage of 
its  disciplinary  proceedings. 
In  any  disciplinary  proceeding  conducted  by 
videoconference,  the  Board  shall  follow  the  same  general  provisions  applicable  to 
videoconferencing in the District Courts, as set forth in Rule 34, Paragraph A, Rules of the 
District Courts, Title 12, Chapter 2, Appendix. 
 

 

d)  The  Board  shall  issue  a  written  report  with  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  as 
applicable,  and its  recommendation to the  Supreme Court for or against  discipline. The 
written report of the Board shall reflect the votes of the members for or against the Board's 
recommendation.  Disciplinary  action  against  a  Registered  or  Certified  Courtroom 
Interpreter shall consist of either: 

1)   Suspension for a period of time up to one (1) year; or 
2)  Revocation of the enrollment of a Registered or Certified Courtroom Interpreter. 

e)  The Board shall issue its written report and recommendation within fifteen (15) days from 
the conclusion of the hearing. The written report and recommendation of the Board shall 
be immediately transmitted to the interpreter, by hand-delivery or by mailing it or sending 
it by third-party commercial carrier for delivery within three (3) calendar days. Proof of 
service shall be documented, and may be made by a certificate of mailing endorsed on the 
written report. 

Effective December 14, 2020) 

ule 7. 

Transmittal of Recommendation and Review by Supreme Court 

a)  Within forty-five (45) days after the date of the hearing, the Board shall file with the Clerk 
of the Supreme Court the complete record of the proceedings, which shall consist of the 
following: 

1)  The complaint; 
2)  The Board's written report and recommendation for or against disciplinary action, and 

proof of service thereof; 
3)  All other pleadings, if any; 
4)  A transcript of the formal disciplinary hearing, if a stenographic recording was made; 

and 

5)  All exhibits offered at the hearing. 
 

b)  Unless  ordered  by  the  Supreme  Court,  a  designation  of  record  will  not  be  required  to 
accompany the materials filed by the Board. An extension of time for preparation of the 
record may be granted only by order of the Supreme Court, for good cause shown. The 
Secretary of the Board shall promptly notify the interpreter respondent and the complainant 
of the completion and transmittal of the record. 
 

 

 

  (

    R

 

 

c)  Either the complainant or the interpreter may, within twenty (20) days of receipt of notice 
of  completion  and  transmittal  of  the  record,  file  a  brief-in-chief  contesting  the  Board's 
recommendation or any part thereof. An answer brief may be filed within ten (10) days 
after the filing of brief-in-chief. A reply brief may be filed within five (5) days after filing 
of the answer brief. 
 

d)  After  filing  of  briefs,  if  any,  the  report  and  recommendations  of  the  Board  shall  stand 
submitted  to  the  Supreme  Court  which  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  adopt  or  reject  such 
recommendations  in  whole  or  in  part,  remand  with  instructions,  or  make  such  other 
disposition  as  the  Supreme  Court  may  deem  proper,  with  or  without  oral  argument  or 
formal written opinion. Either party aggrieved by the decision of the Supreme Court may 
make application for rehearing as provided by the Rules of the Supreme Court. 
 

e)  During the pendency of a formal disciplinary proceeding, if an interpreter allows his or her 
certificate  to  be  administratively  revoked  for  failure  to  satisfy  renewal  or  continuing 
education requirements, such revocation shall be deemed to be equivalent to a resignation 
pending disciplinary proceeding as provided in Rule 8. Upon such revocation, the Board 
may elect to discontinue further action in the formal disciplinary proceeding. If the matter 
has been submitted to the Supreme Court, the Board shall file a notice with the Clerk of 
the Supreme Court advising of the administrative revocation. 

Effective January 12, 2015) 

ule 8. 

Resignation Pending Disciplinary Proceedings 

a)  An interpreter who is the subject of an investigation or a pending disciplinary proceeding 
may resign from enrollment as a Registered or Certified Courtroom Interpreter, and thereby 
relinquish the right to engage in courtroom interpreting in this state, by delivering to the 
Board a signed affidavit stating that the interpreter desires to resign and that: 

1)  The  resignation  is  freely  and  voluntarily  rendered,  the  interpreter  is  not  subject  to 
coercion or duress, and the interpreter is fully aware of the consequences of submitting 
the resignation; 

2)  The  interpreter  is  aware  that  there  is  presently  pending  an  investigation  into,  or  a 
proceeding  involving,  allegations  that  there  exist  grounds  for  discipline,  specifying 
particularly the misconduct alleged; and 

3)  The interpreter understands that no application for reinstatement may be filed prior to 

the lapse of five (5) years from the effective date of the resignation. 

 

b)  Upon receipt of the required affidavit, the Board shall deliver it to the Chief Justice, or if a 
formal  disciplinary  proceeding  case  file  has  been  opened,  file  it  with  the  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme  Court,  and  the  Supreme  Court  may  enter  an  order  approving  the  resignation 
pending disciplinary proceedings. An interpreter who so resigns shall not be permitted to 
apply  for  reinstatement  until  five  (5)  years  have  lapsed  from  the  effective  date  of  the 

  (

    R

 

 

resignation, and subject to the requirements of Rule 9 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary 
Proceedings. 

Effective January 12, 2015) 

a)  Any interpreter who, as a result of formal disciplinary proceedings, has been suspended by 
order of the Supreme Court for a period of one (1) year or less may apply to have his/her 
certificate  reinstated  without  further  proceedings  before  the  Board  by  filing  a  verified 
application with the Secretary of the Board which shall state: 

1)  That the term of the suspension as ordered by the decision of the Supreme Court has 

expired;
