      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE PARENTING PLAN PARENT-CREATED 
Sole Legal and Sole Physical Custody with One Parent 

IMPORTANT: USE OF THE SOLE LEGAL AND SOLE PHYSICAL CUSTODY 
PARENTING PLAN IS INTENDED ONLY FOR THOSE CASES IN WHICH: 

• ONE PARENT HAS SOLE LEGAL CUSTODY OF THE CHILD(REN)

(DECISION- MAKING)

• ONE PARENT WILL HAVE PRIMARY (SOLE) PHYSICAL CUSTODY OF
THE CHILD(REN) (PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND PARENTING TIME)

If you want items in your parenting plan besides those in this sample provided, you can 
add them to your plan. Likewise, if you do not want some items in your parenting plan 
that are in this sample, you can take them out of your plan. For example, you may want 
to add other holidays, take out particular holidays, change time periods, change the 
method of pick up and return times for parenting time, change the length of time for 
summer parenting time, etc. Also, if you observe holidays that are not included in this 
sample, you can add language to your plan about those holidays. Remember, this is 
your parenting plan and it should meet your individual needs. 

• The parenting plan provides a legal “fall back” plan for parents to use if there is a

need. Parents can alter this plan informally if all are in agreement. However, if there
is a disagreement, the provisions in this plan control the parenting time.

• The parents can temporarily change the terms of this plan as long as they both agree.
• This plan may be changed by mutual, written agreement of the parents.
• The parents understand that any permanent changes must be approved by the court

to be binding and enforceable.

Please remember, your parenting plan will be reviewed by the judge and will 
need to be court ordered before it takes legal effect. 

If you are printing the Parenting Plan and 
handwriting the answers, you will check the first 
box. If you are typing in your answers, you will 
check the second box.
