 REQUIRED 

JC 14:6  Rev. 08/11
Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 71-6901 
to 71-6909

INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
WAIVER OF PARENTAL 
CONSENT 

If you are a pregnant unemancipated woman under the age of 18, or a pregnant woman for whom a 

guardian has been appointed, and you wish to have a physician perform an abortion without a written consent 
from one of your parents or legal guardian, you may file a petition requesting a court order allowing the 
abortion without the consent of your parent or guardian.  (Unemancipated means legally under the custody or 
control of your parent(s) or guardian.) 

Complete the form PETITION FOR WAIVER OF PARENTAL CONSENT. The clerk of the court will 

assist you with administrative matters but will not provide you with legal advice.  To insure your anonymity, you 
may file the form using a pseudonym or your initials instead of your name.  File the form with the clerk of the 
court personally or by mail or fax.  There is no fee for filing the petition.  The petition may be filed in the district 
court, separate juvenile court, or a county court sitting as a juvenile court.  The name, address, and telephone 
number of each court in which you may file your petition are included with these instructions.  Note: In 
Douglas, Lancaster, and Sarpy Counties, you must file your petition in the district or separate juvenile court 
and not in the county court. 

When you file your petition you will be told where and when to appear.  The hearing may be held 

immediately or it may be delayed until a judge is available.  If you do not deliver the petition to the court in 
person, or provide contact information, you must contact the court  immediately after they receive it in order to 
obtain your hearing date and time.  Because of the strict confidentiality requirements, court personnel will need 
your full cooperation so that you may be contacted with necessary information about your case.  The court will 
not contact you unless you have given them permission, and a method of contacting you confidentially. 

You may hire your own attorney, or you are entitled to have an attorney appointed to represent you at 

no cost to you.  If you request an attorney, the judge will appoint one to represent you.  The judge may also 
appoint a guardian ad litem for you if the judge decides it is necessary.  (A guardian ad litem is an attorney 
appointed to represent your best interests.)  

At the hearing, you or your attorney or guardian ad litem will need to provide evidence to the court that 

1. You are sufficiently mature and well-informed enough to decide whether to have an abortion.

This will include testimony on your emotional development, maturity, intellect and
understanding; or

2. You have been the victim of abuse, sexual abuse or child abuse or neglect by a parent or

guardian, and that an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian is in your best
interests.

All proceedings are confidential and held in private.  Only you, your guardian ad litem, your 

attorney, and any person whose presence is specifically requested by you, your guardian ad litem, or 
your attorney, may attend the hearing.  All testimony, documents, other evidence presented to the 
court, the petition, and any order entered are confidential and will be kept sealed by the court and not 
open to inspection by any person except upon order of the court for good cause shown.

Instructions for Waiver of Parental Consent.
JC 14:6  Rev. 08/11

The court is required to issue a ruling within seven calendar days from the time you file your petition. 

1. After the hearing, the court will normally make one of four findings: (a) You are sufficiently

mature and well-informed to decide whether or not to have an abortion; (b) You have been the
victim of abuse, sexual abuse or child abuse or neglect by a parent or guardian, and an abortion
without the consent of a parent or guardian is in your best interests. (c) you have not proven that
you are sufficiently mature and well-informed enough to decide whether to have an abortion
without consent of your parent or guardian; (d) you have not proven that you have been abused
or neglected by your parents or guardian, and it is not in your best interests for the physician to
perform the proposed abortion without notarized written consent from a parent or guardian.

2. Depending upon the findings, the court will enter an order authorizing you to consent to the

abortion without consent of your parent or guardian, or will dismiss your petition.  The order may
be issued immediately after the hearing or it may be delayed a short while, but no longer than
seven calendar days from the date you filed the petition.

If the court fails to rule within seven days you may file a mandamus action with the Clerk of the 
Nebraska Supreme Court to direct the inferior court to act.  If this is necessary, your attorney or guardian ad 
litem will assist you. 

If the court dismisses your petition for waiver of parental consent for an abortion, you may appeal the 
decision to the Nebraska Supreme Court.  Complete the NOTICE OF APPEAL document and file it with the 
clerk of the court that dismissed the petition.  The transcript and bill of exceptions (case records) will be 
prepared by the clerk of the court and court reporter/stenographer at no cost to you.  The necessary 
documents will be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court no later than seven calendar days from the date of 
filing the notice of appeal.  You will not have to appear personally in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court 
will review the written record and issue a written decision on your appeal within seven calendar days from the 
time they receive the appeal.  The decision of the Supreme Court will be provided to you, your attorney, the 
guardian ad litem, or any other person designated by you to receive the order. 

The petition and notice of appeal documents are available with these instructions.  If they are not 
available, you can get them online at www.supremecourt.ne.gov or contact the clerk of the court, who will 
provide you with the proper forms  

Pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. sec. 71-6903 this document shall be made available in each courthouse in such a place that members of the public may obtain it 
without requesting it from the clerk of the court or other court personnel.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
