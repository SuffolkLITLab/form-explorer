CC 6:9   Rev 04/17 
Neb. Rev. Stat. § 29-4007

NOTIFICATION OF REGISTRATION 
RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER 
NEBRASKA SEX OFFENDER 
REGISTRATION ACT 

STATE OF NEBRASKA, 

vs. 

Plaintiff, 

Defendant. 

NOTICE TO DEFENDANT: 

Case No. 

NOTIFICATION OF REGISTRATION 
RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER NEBRASKA 
SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION ACT 

Your conviction or guilty plea has caused you to be subject to the Nebraska Sex Offender Registration Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 29-4001 to 29-4014.  The 
date you become subject to the Act is no later than the date of your sentencing. According to the Nebraska Sex Offender Registration Act, you are 
required to report to a location designated by the Nebraska State Patrol for purposes of registration within three (3) working days after you become 
subject to the Act.  An appeal of your conviction does not relieve you from the registration requirements. 

If you have a new address, temporary domicile or habitual living location within the same county, you are required to register in person at the
county sheriff within three (3) working days before the move.

If you have a new address, temporary domicile or habitual living location in a different county within the state, you are required to report the
change in person with the current county sheriff within 3 working days before the change. You must also report in person to the county sheriff
in your new county of residence and register within three (3) working days after the change.

If you are moving out of state, you are required to report the change in person with the current county sheriff within three (3) working days
before the change. You must also comply with the registration requirements of that state.

Any person required to register who no longer has a residence, or temporary domicile, or habitual living location shall register with the county
sheriff in which he or she is transient within three (3) working days. Such person shall update his or her registration, in person on a form
approved by the sex offender registration and community notification division of the Nebraska State Patrol at least once every thirty calendar
days during the time he or she remains without residence, or temporary domicile, or habitual living location.

Any person required to register who is incarcerated for more than three (3) days is required to give notice of the incarceration and expected
release date, if available, to the sheriff of the county in which you would reside or would be temporarily domiciled but for your incarceration.
You are to give the sheriff this notice within three (3) working days of your incarceration.  Prior to any type of release from incarceration, you
are to report your change of address to the sheriff of the county in which you are incarcerated and to the county sheriff of the county in which
you reside or are temporarily domiciled.

If you are employed, carry on a vocation or attend school (with or without compensation), you must register in person with the county sheriff of
the county in which you are employed, carry on a vocation or attend school within three (3) working days after becoming employed, carrying
on a vocation or attending school.  You must provide the location of each work site and education institution.  You must also notify the sheriff
of any change in such employment, vocation or school attendance within three (3) working days after the change.

If you reside, move, or are temporarily domiciled out of state, but are employed or carry on a vocation (with or without compensation), or
attend school in this state, you must report in person, and register with, the county sheriff of the county in which you are employed, carry on a
vocation, or attend school within three (3) working days.  You must also notify the sheriff of any change in such employment, vocation, or
attendance status at the school or postsecondary educational institution, in person, within three (3) working days of such change.  You shall
inform the sheriff of any legal change in name, in writing, within three (3) working days after such change, and provide a copy of the legal
documentation supporting the change in name.

If, while residing or being temporarily domiciled in Nebraska, you go to another state to attend school or work, you must comply with the
registration requirements of both states.

You must complete a full registration including fingerprints, palm prints, a photograph and DNA which will be obtained by any registering entity in order 
to comply with the registration requirements.  You must register all addresses, employment, school, vehicles, travel and immigration documents, 
professional licenses and certificates, and telephone numbers as required under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 29-4006. You are required to report any changes 
thereafter in three (3) working days in person with the county sheriff. 

The registration and verification requirements under the Act are continuing ones.  You shall be required to register during any period of supervised 
release, probation, or parole and shall continue to comply with the act for the period of time as prescribed below after the date of discharge from 
probation, parole, or supervised release or release from incarceration, whichever date is most recent. The duration of time you will be required to register 
will be between fifteen years and lifetime. Upon receipt of registration and confirmation of the registry requirement, the sex offender registration and 
community notification division of the Nebraska State Patrol shall notify the person by certified mail of his or her registry duration and verification 
schedule. The possible full registration periods and verification schedules are as follows:

Fifteen years, if the sex offender was convicted of a registrable offense under section 29-4003 not punishable by imprisonment for more than 
one year; Annual verification: The offender shall report annually in the month of his or her birth, in person, to the office of the sheriff of the 
county in which he or she resides for purposes of accepting verifications, regardless of the original registration month.
Twenty-five years, if the sex offender was convicted of a registrable offense under section 29-4003 punishable by imprisonment for 1 more than 
one year;  Biannual verifications: The offender shall report, in person, in the month of his or her birth and in the sixth month following the month 
of his or her birth, regardless of the original registration month.
Life, if the sex offender was convicted of a registrable offense under section 29-4003 punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and 
was convicted of an aggravated offense, had a prior sex offense conviction, has been determined to be a Predator, or has been determined to 
be a lifetime registrant in another state, territory, commonwealth, or other jurisdiction of the United States, by the United States Government, by 
court-martial or other military tribunal, or by a foreign jurisdiction; Quarterly verifications: The offender shall report, in person, in the month of 
his or her birth and every three months following the month of his or her birth, regardless of the original registration month.

A sex offender who is required to register for fifteen years may request a reduction in the registration period to ten years upon completion of ten years of 
the registration period after the date of discharge from probation, parole, supervised release, or incarceration, whichever date is most recent. The sex 
offender shall make the request to the Nebraska State Patrol. The sex offender shall provide proof as listed under Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 29-4005(2). 

Any time period when any person who is required to register under the act fails to comply with such registration requirement shall not be 
counted as completed registration time and shall be used to recalculate the registration period. 

Any person required to register under the Act who violates the Act has committed a Class IIIA felony. Any person previously convicted of a violation  of 
the Act is guilty of a Class IIA felony and shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of at least one year in prison unless the act which caused 
the person to be placed on the registry was a misdemeanor, in which case the violation of the Act shall be a Class IIIA felony. 

The above is a summary of your registration and verification responsibilities under the Act.  You should familiarize yourself with the Act and be alert to 
any amendments to it. 

If you are committed to the Department of Correctional Services for a conviction where the victim was a minor or a vulnerable adult, you shall attend 
appropriate sex offender treatment and counseling programming offered by the department.  Refusal to participate in such programming shall not result 
in disciplinary action or a loss of good time credit for you, but it shall require you to undergo a civil commitment evaluation prior to the completion of your 
criminal sentence. 

By my signature below, I acknowledge that I have read this Notification which explains my duty to register and I understand my obligations under the act.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
