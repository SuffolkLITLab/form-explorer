      <pre>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR REQUESTING 

TEST ACCOMMODATIONS  

The  Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission  encourages persons  with  disabilities  to  apply  for  test 
accommodations.  Reasonable  test  accommodations  will  be  made  on  the  Nebraska  Bar 
Examination  for  qualified  applicants  with  disabilities.  The  Nebraska  Bar  Examination  is  a 
two  day  timed  examination  designed  to  test  the  knowledge  and  skills  necessary  for  one  who 
seeks admission to the Nebraska Bar.  

It is the policy of the Nebraska State Bar Commission to administer the bar examination and all 
other services of this office in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended 
(ADA).  A  qualified  applicant  with  a  disability  who  is  otherwise  eligible  to  take  the  bar 
examination, but who cannot demonstrate under standard testing conditions that he/she possesses 
the  knowledge  and  skills  to  be  admitted  to  the  Nebraska  Bar,  may  request  reasonable  test 
accommodations.  

The  Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission  will  make  reasonable  modifications  to  any  policies, 
practices, and procedures that might otherwise prevent individuals with disabilities from taking 
the bar examination in an accessible place or manner, provided such modifications do not result 
in a fundamental alteration to the examination or other admission requirements, impose an undue 
burden,  or  jeopardize  examination  security.  In  order  to  accommodate  disabled  persons,  the 
Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission  will  furnish  additional  testing  time,  auxiliary  aids,  and  other 
accommodations  when  necessary  to  ameliorate  the  impact  of  the  applicant’s  disability  on  the 
applicant’s  ability  to  take  the  bar  examination.  No  additional  charges  will  be  assessed  to 
individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of reasonable accommodations.  

Requests for test accommodations will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The applicant must 
submit documentation from one or more qualified professionals that provides information on the 
diagnosed  impairment(s),  the  applicant’s  current  level  of  impairment,  and  the  rationale  for  the 
accommodations  requested  on  the  bar  examination.  In  addition,  the  applicant  must  submit 
verifying documentation of his or her history of accommodations, if any. All documentation will 
be  retained  by  the  Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission  and  may  be  submitted  to  one  or  more 
qualified professionals  for  an  impartial  review.  Accommodations  granted  elsewhere  do  not 
necessarily  entitle  an  applicant  to  accommodations  on  the  bar  examination,  although  the 
Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission  gives  considerable  weight  to  documentation  relating  to  past 
accommodations  received  in  similar  testing  situations  or  in  response  to  an  IEP  or  Section  504 
plan.  

DEFINITIONS 
1. Disability  is  a  physical  or  mental  impairment  that  substantially  limits  one  or  more  of  the
major  life  activities  of  the  applicant.  In  the  bar  examination  setting,  the  impairment  must
limit  an  applicant’s  ability  to  demonstrate,  under  standard  testing  conditions,  that  the
applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities tested on the bar examination.

2. Physical  impairment  is  a  physiological  disorder  or  condition,  cosmetic  disfigurement,  or

anatomical loss affecting one or more of the body’s systems.

General Instructions-Page 1 

NSBC 1:10
Rev. 03/2020 

3. Mental  impairment  is  any  mental  or  psychological  disorder  such  as  intellectual  disability,

organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, or any specific learning disability.

4. Major  life  activities  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  caring  for  oneself,  performing  manual
tasks,  walking,  seeing,  hearing,  speaking,  breathing,  learning,  reading,  concentrating,
thinking, communicating, and working.

5. Reasonable  accommodation  is  an  adjustment  or  modification  of  the  standard  testing
conditions,  or  an  appropriate  auxiliary  aid  or  service,  that  ameliorates  the  impact  of  the
applicant’s disability without doing any of the following:
a.

fundamentally  altering  the  nature  of  the  bar  examination,  including  but  not  limited  to
compromising the validity or reliability of the examination; or
imposing an undue burden on the Nebraska State Bar Commission; or
jeopardizing examination security.

b.
c.

6. Qualified professional is a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other health care

provider who has appropriate training in the field related to the applicant’s disability.

FILING DEADLINE  
Requests  for  accommodations  will  be  considered  after  receipt  of  all  required  information.  The 
in  Section  V  of  Form  1:  Applicant  Request  for  Test 
Applicant  Checklist, 
Accommodations, must be submitted with the application. The applicable items specified in the 
Applicant  Checklist  must  be  completed  and  uploaded to your application on or before the filing 
deadline of the exam the applicant wishes to take. 

located 

Applicants  with  disabilities  are  subject to  the  same  application  deadline  as  individuals  without 
disabilities. Because some of the accommodation request forms require input from third parties, 
the  appropriate  individuals  should  be  asked  to  complete  the  forms  well  in  advance  of  the 
deadline. 

A  timely request  for test  accommodations for the  February administration  of the Nebraska 
Bar  Examination must be uploaded to your application no later than November 1. 

A  timely  request  for  test  accommodations  for  the  July  administration  of  the  Nebraska Bar 
Examination must be uploaded to your application no later than March 1. 

ALL  APPLICATIONS  ARE  DUE  ON  OR  BEFORE  FILING  DEADLINE.   NO  LATE  APPLICATIONS 
ACCEPTED.

General Instructions-Page 2 

RETAKE APPLICANTS 
Applicants  who  retake  the  examination  must  submit  Form  1:  Applicant  Request  for  Test 
Accommodations each time they apply for the bar examination, even if they previously requested 
and were granted accommodations by the Nebraska State Bar Commission. It is not necessary to 
resubmit  supporting  documentation  that  was  submitted  with  a  previous  request,  provided  the 
applicant  sat  for  the  Nebraska  Bar  Examination  within  the  preceding  three  years  and  (1)  is 
requesting  the  same  accommodations  that  were  received  previously  on  the  Nebraska  Bar 
Examination  and  (2)  has  had  no  material  changes  in  his/her  condition.  New  supporting 
documentation is required if there is any change in the accommodations requested. An update to 
prior medical documentation is required assessing the applicant’s current functional limitations 
and ongoing need for accommodations if the nature of the applicant’s disability or disabilities is 
changeable. The Nebraska State Bar Commission reserves the right to request an update to prior 
documentation in all cases if it determines that the prior documentation is insufficient to establish 
the applicant’s current level of impairment and need for accommodations.  

APPEALS 
In reviewing a request, the commission will follow these procedures. 

• The commission will make a determination, and the secretary of the commission will

send notification of the determination to the applicant, no fewer than 25 days before the
examination.

• The commission's denial of a request will be in writing and sent to the applicant by

certified mail to the address provided by the applicant on the request. The commission's
denial will include a statement of the commission's reasons for denial. The commission
will also provide the applicant with a copy of the written report of any expert it consulted
in reviewing the request.

• The applicant may appeal the denial of a request to the Supreme Court in accordance

with §3-110 and §3-115.

The commission may delegate to a committee of bar examiners its authority to review and rule 
upon requests pursuant to this policy. 

STEPS FOR SUBMITTING A COMPLETE REQUEST 
This  application  packet  contains  seven  separate  forms,  but  you  need  only  submit  those 
forms and documents that pertain to your particular disability. Please carefully review the 
information  below  to  ensure  that  you  submit  a  complete  request.  A  checklist  is  provided  in 
Section V of Form 1: Applicant Request for Test Accommodations, which you should complete 
and submit with your request. All required forms and documentation must be submitted together 
to the Nebraska State Bar Commission along with the completed uniform bar application by the 
deadline. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some of the forms that must be submitted with your request must 
be completed by third parties and returned to you for submission to the Make certain that 
you request completion of these forms by the third parties in a timely manner so that you are able 
to submit your request by the deadline.  

STEP 1: Have a qualified professional complete the applicable disability verification form 
and  return  it  to  you  for  submission  to  the  Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission.  There  are 
separate  forms  for  learning  disabilities,  AD/HD,  psychological  disabilities,  visual  disabilities, 

General Instructions-Page 3 

and physical disabilities. You will need to complete the top portion of the applicable disability 
verification form and request that your qualified professional complete the rest of the form and 
return it to you. Your qualified professional should attach to the completed disability verification 
form a comprehensive evaluation report and/or relevant records, as specified in the form.  

STEP  2:  Gather  verifying  documentation  of  your  history  of  accommodations  requests,  if 
any. Submit a Form 7: Certification of Accommodations History completed by each educational 
institution  or  testing  agency  (hereinafter  “entity”)  from  which  you  requested  accommodations, 
whether  your request was granted or denied. Complete the top portion of the form and request 
that the entity complete the rest of the form and return it to you for submission to the Nebraska 
State  Bar  Commission.  Alternatively,  you  may  provide  other  proof  of  your  accommodations 
history, such as a copy of the letter(s) you received from the entity notifying you of the specific 
accommodations granted or denied. The proof should identify the time frame (e.g., third year of 
law school) and the nature of the disability (e.g., AD/HD) for which any accommodations were 
granted  or  denied.  If  you  received  accommodations  as  a  result  of  an  Individualized  Education 
Plan (IEP) or a 504 Plan, please provide copies of all IEPs or 504 Plans. 

STEP  3:  If  the  nature  of  your  disability  is  AD/HD  or  a  learning  disability,  provide 
transcripts.  Attach  copies  of  your  undergraduate  and  law  school  transcripts  and  your  LSAC 
Academic Summary Report. Photocopies of transcripts are acceptable for this purpose. You can 
obtain  your  LSAC  Academic  Summary  Report  by  logging  in  to  your  LSAC  account  at 
www.lsac.org. Click on “Transcripts,” then click on “Academic Summary Report,” and print the 
report.  If  you  have  trouble  obtaining  the  report,  contact  an  LSAC  representative  at  215-968-
1001. 

Learning disabilities and AD/HD are developmental disorders with childhood onset, even if not 
diagnosed  until  adulthood.  Transcripts  or  report  cards  of  your  elementary,  middle  school,  and 
high  school  education,  while  not  required,  are  useful  in  providing  evidence  of  symptoms  and 
impairment present during childhood. The Nebraska State Bar Commission reserves the right to 
request such academic records in particular cases. 

STEP 4:  Complete and  sign Form 1:  Applicant Request for Test Accommodations. Attach 
all  relevant  forms  and  documents,  as  indicated  above,  so  that  all  required  documentation  is 
provided in one submission.

TTACH  A  COMPREHENSIVE  EVALUATION  REPORT.  An  applicant’s  specific 
learning disabilities must have  been  identified by  an appropriate  psychoeducational assessment 
process that is well documented in the form of a comprehensive diagnostic report. The provision 
of reasonable accommodations is based on assessment of the current impact of the disability on 
the specific testing activity. Although a learning disability normally is lifelong, the severity and 
manifestations  can  change.  The  Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission  generally  requires 
documentation  from  an  evaluation  conducted  within  the  last  five  years  to  establish  the  current 
impact of the disability. Attach to this form a copy of the comprehensive evaluation report 
and  all  records  and  test  results  on  which  you  relied  in  making  the  diagnosis  and 
recommending  accommodations  for  the  Nebraska  Bar  Examination.  The  evaluation  report 
should include the following: 

.  an  account  of  a  thorough  diagnostic  interview  that  summarizes  relevant  components  of  the 

individual’s developmental, medical, family, social, and educational history; 

B.  clear,  objective  evidence  of  a  substantial  limitation  to  learning  or  performance  provided 
through  assessment  in  the  areas  of  cognitive  aptitude,  achievement,  and  information 
processing  abilities  (results  must  be  obtained  on  standardized  test(s)  appropriate  to  the 
general adult population and be reported in age-based standard scores and percentiles); 

C.  interpretation  of  the  diagnostic  profile  that  integrates  assessment  data,  background  history, 
and observations made during the evaluation process, as well as the inclusion or ruling out of 
possible coexisting conditions (such as previously diagnosed psychological issues or English 
as a second language) affecting the applicant’s performance;

limitations on the applicant’s major life activities. 

Form 2-Page 4 

 

D.  a specific diagnostic statement, which should not include nonspecific terms such as “learning 

differences,” “learning styles,” or “academic problems”; and 

E.  a rationale for each recommended accommodation based on diagnostic information presented 

(background history, test scores, documented observations, etc.). 

t is important that  the tests used in the  evaluation  are  reliable, valid,  and  age-appropriate, and 
that the most recent edition of each diagnostic measure is used. Scores should be reported as age-
based  standard  scores  and  percentiles.  The  following  lists  of  tests  are  provided  as  a  guide  to 
assessment instruments appropriate for the adult population. The lists are not intended to be all-
inclusive and will vary with the needs of the individual being evaluated.

- Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ III): Tests of Cognitive Ability 

- Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (4th ed.) 

- Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test 

Please  note:  The  Slossen  Intelligence  Test  and  the  Kaufman  Brief  Intelligence  Test  are 
primarily  screening  instruments  and  should  not  be  considered  comprehensive  measures  of 
aptitude/cognitive ability. 

2.  Achievement 

- Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ III): Tests of Achievement 

- Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT) 

- Scholastic Abilities Test for Adults (SATA) 

Please  note:  The  Wide  Range  Achievement  Test:  Third  Edition  (WRAT-3),  the  Peabody 
Individual Achievement Test (PIAT, PIAT-R), and the Nelson Denny Reading Test are not 
comprehensive measures of academic achievement and should not be used as sole measures 
in this area. 

3.  Information Processing 

- Wechsler Memory Scale III 

- Swanson Cognitive Process Test (S-CPT) 

- Test of Adolescent/Adult Wordfinding (TAWF) 

- Information  from  subtest,  index,  and/or  cluster  scores  on  the  WAIS  III  (Working
Memory, Perceptual Organization, Processing Speed) and/or the Woodcock-Johnson III
(WJ  III):  Tests  of  Cognitive  Ability  (Visual  Processing,  Short  Term  Memory,  Long
Term Memory, Processing Speed) and/or The Detroit Tests of Learning Aptitude-Adult
(DTLA-A),  as  well  as  other  neuropsychological  instruments  that  measure  rapid
automatized naming and/or phonological processing.

IV. ACCOMMODATIONS RECOMMENDED FOR THE NEBRASKA BAR

EXAMINATION (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY)

The Nebraska Bar Examination is a two day timed examination.  

The  first  day  consists of  six  essay  questions  (MEE).    The  MEE  is   designed  to  assess,  among 
other  things,  the  applicant’s  ability  to  communicate  his/her analysis  effectively  in  writing. 
Applicants may use their personal laptop computers to type their answers, or they may handwrite 
their answers. 

The  second  day  consists  of  200  multiple-choice  questions  (MBE),  with  100  questions 
administered  in  the  morning  session  and  100  questions  in  the  afternoon  session.  Applicants 
record  their  answers  by  darkening circles on  an  answer sheet  with a  number two  pencil that is 
scanned by a computer to grade the examination. 

Applicants are assigned seats. They are not allowed to bring food, beverages, or other items into 
the testing room unless approved as accommodations. The examination is administered in a quiet 
environment,  and  applicants are allowed  to  use small foam earplugs provided by the Nebraska 
State Bar Commission. They may leave the room only to use the restroom or drinking fountain, 
within the time allotted for the test session. 

Taking into consideration this description of the examination and the functional limitations 
currently  experienced  by  the  applicant,  what test  accommodation (or  accommodations,  if 
more than one would be appropriate) do you recommend?

.  Describe  the  applicant’s  symptoms  of  AD/HD  that  were  present  in  childhood  or  early 
adolescence  (even  if  not  formally  diagnosed)  that  caused  significant  impairment  across 
multiple settings. Provide copies of any objective evidence of those symptoms, such as report 
cards, teacher comments, tutoring evaluations, etc. 

TTACH  A  COMPREHENSIVE  EVALUATION  REPORT.  The  provision  of  reasonable 
accommodations  is  based  on  assessment  of  the  current  impact  of  the  disability  on  the  specific 
testing activity. The Nebraska State Bar Commission generally requires documentation from an 
evaluation conducted within the last three years to establish the current impact of the disability. 
The  diagnostic  criteria  as  specified  in  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental 
Disorders,  Fourth  Edition  (DSM-IV-TR)  (or  most  current  version)  are  used  as  the  basic 
guidelines for determination of an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) diagnosis. 
The  diagnosis  depends  on  objective  evidence  of  AD/HD  symptoms  that  occur  early  in  the 
applicant’s  development  and  cause  the  applicant  clinically  significant  impairment  within 
multiple environments. Applicant self-report alone is generally insufficient to establish evidence 
for the diagnosis. Please provide a comprehensive evaluation report that addresses all five points 
below. 
 

A.  Sufficient  numbers  of  symptoms  (delineated  in  DSM-IV-TR)  of  inattention  and/or 
hyperactivity-impulsivity  that  have  persisted  for  at  least  six  months  to  a  degree  that  is  
“maladaptive” and inconsistent with developmental level. The exact symptoms should be 
described in detail. 

B.  Objective  evidence  that  symptoms  of  inattention  and/or  hyperactivity-impulsivity  that 

caused impairment were present during childhood. 

C.  Objective evidence indicating that current impairment from the symptoms is observable 
in two or more settings. There must be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment 

Form 3-Page 3 

 

within  the  academic  setting.  However,  there  must  also  be  evidence  that  these  problems 
are not confined to the academic setting. 

D.  A determination that  the  symptoms of  AD/HD  are not a function of some other mental 
disorder  (such  as  a  mood,  anxiety,  or  personality  disorder;  psychosis;  substance  abuse; 
low cognitive ability; etc.). 

E.  Indication  of  the  specific  AD/HD  diagnostic  subtype:  predominantly  inattentive  type, 

hyperactive-impulsive type, combined type, or not otherwise specified. 

II. FORMAL TESTING 

sychological testing  and  self-report checklists cannot  be  used  as the sole  indicator of  AD/HD 
diagnosis  independent  of  history  and  interview.  However,  such  findings  can  augment  clinical 
data.  They  are  particularly  necessary  to  rule  out  intellectual  limitation  as  an  alternative 
explanation  for  academic  difficulty,  to  describe  type  and  severity  of  learning  problems,  and  to 
assess the severity of  cognitive  deficits associated with AD/HD (inattention, working memory, 
etc.). 

1.  Is there evidence from empirically validated rating scales completed by more than one source 
 No 

that levels of AD/HD symptoms fall in the abnormal range? 

 Yes 

 

 

If yes, please provide copies.

V. ACCOMMODATIONS RECOMMENDED FOR THE NEBRASKA BAR

EXAMINATION (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY)

The Nebraska Bar Examination is a two day timed examination.  

The  first  day  consists  of  six  essay  questions  (MEE).    The  MEE  is  designed  to  assess,  among 
other  things,  the  applicant’s  ability  to  communicate  his/her  analysis  effectively  in  writing. 
Applicants may use their personal laptop computers to type their answers, or they may handwrite 
their answers. 

The  second  day  consists  of  200  multiple-choice  questions  (MBE),  with  100  questions 
administered  in  the  morning  session  and  100  questions  in  the  afternoon  session.  Applicants 
record their  answers  by  darkening circles on an answer sheet with a number two pencil that is 
scanned by a computer to grade the examination. 

Applicants are assigned seats. They are not allowed to bring food, beverages, or other items into 
the testing room unless approved as accommodations. The examination is administered in a quiet 
environment,  and  applicants  are allowed to use  small foam earplugs provided by the Nebraska 
State Bar Commission. They may leave the room only to use the restroom or drinking fountain, 
within the time allotted for the test session. 

Taking into consideration this description of the examination and the functional limitations 
currently  experienced  by  the  applicant, what test  accommodation  (or  accommodations,  if 
more than one would be appropriate) do you recommend?

OTICE TO QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL:  

he above-named person is requesting accommodations on the Nebraska Bar Examination. All such 
requests  must  be  supported  by  a  comprehensive  evaluation  report  from  the  qualified  professional 
who conducted an individualized assessment of the applicant and is recommending accommodations 
on the bar examination on the basis of a physical disability. The Nebraska State Bar Commission also 
requires  the  qualified  professional  to  complete  this  form.  If  any  of  the  information  requested  in 
this form is fully addressed in the comprehensive evaluation report, you may respond by citing 
the  specific  page  and  paragraph  where  the  answer  can  be  found.    Please  attach  a  copy  of  the 
evaluation  report  and  all  records  and  test  results  on  which  you  relied  in  making  the  diagnosis  and 
recommending accommodations for the Nebraska Bar Examination. We appreciate your assistance. 

he  provision  of  reasonable  accommodations  is  based  on  assessment  of  the  current  impact  of  the 
disability  on  the  specific  testing  activity.  The  Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission  generally  requires 
documentation  from  an  evaluation  conducted  within  the  past  year  because  of  the  changing 
manifestations of many physical disabilities. Older evaluation reports may suffice if supplemented by 
an  update  of  the  diagnosis,  current  level  of  functioning,  and  a  rationale  for  each  recommended 
accommodation or an explanation of why the report continues to be relevant in its entirety. 

he  Nebraska  State  Bar  Commission  may  forward  this  information  to  one  or  more  qualified 
professionals for an independent review of the applicant’s request. Print or type your responses to the 
items  below.  Return  this  completed  form,  the  comprehensive  evaluation  report,  and  relevant 
records to the applicant for submission to the Nebraska State Bar Commission.

III. ACCOMMODATIONS RECOMMENDED FOR THE NEBRASKA BAR

EXAMINATION (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY)

The Nebraska Bar Examination is a two day timed examination.  

The  first  day  consists  of  six  essay  questions  (MEE).    The  MEE  is  designed  to  assess,  among 
other  things,  the  applicant’s  ability  to  communicate  his/her  analysis  effectively  in  writing. 
Applicants may use their personal laptop computers to type their answers, or they may handwrite 
their answers. 

The  second  day  consists  of  200  multiple-choice  questions  (MBE),  with  100  questions 
administered  in  the  morning  session  and  100  questions  in  the  afternoon  session.  Applicants 
record their  answers  by  darkening circles on an answer sheet with a number two pencil that is 
scanned by a computer to grade the examination. 

Applicants are assigned seats. They are not allowed to bring food, beverages, or other items into 
the testing room unless approved as accommodations. The examination is administered in a quiet 
environment,  and applicants are allowed to use small foam earplugs provided by the Nebraska 
State Bar Commission. They may leave the room only to use the restroom or drinking fountain, 
within the time allotted for the test session. 

Taking into consideration this description of the examination and the functional limitations 
currently  experienced  by  the  applicant, what  test  accommodation  (or  accommodations,  if 
more than one would be appropriate) do you recommend? 

Test question formats: 

  Braille 

  Audio CD 

Microsoft  Word  document  on  data  CD  for  use  with  screen-reading  software  (for 
MEE and MPT sessions)
