It is the policy of the Nebraska State Bar Commission to administer the bar examination and all . othe. r . services of this office in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. , as amended. (ADA) . . A qualified appli. cant with a disability who is otherwise eligible to take the bar . ex. amination, but who cannot demonstrate under standard testing conditions that he/she possesses . the. knowledge and skills to be. admitted to the Nebraska Bar, may request reasonable test . accomm. odations. . The Nebraska State Bar Commission will make reasonable modifications to any policies, . . practices, and procedures that might otherwise . prevent. individuals with disabilities. from taking . the bar examination in an accessible place or manner. , provided such modifications do not result . . in a fundamental alteration . to the examination or other admission requirements, impose an undue . burden, or . jeopardize examination security. In order to accommodate disabled persons, the . Ne. braska State Bar Commission . will. furnish additional testing time, auxiliary aids, and other . accommodations when necessary to ameliorate the impact of the applicant. ™s disability on the . applicant. ™s . ability to take the bar examination. . No additional charges will be assessed to . individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of reasonable accommodations. . Requests for. test accommodations will be . evaluated . on a cas. e by case basis. . The applicant must . subm. it . documentation from one or more. qualified . professionals that provides information on the . diagnosed impairment (s) , . the applicant. ™s . current level of impairment, and the rationale for . the . accommodations. requested on the bar . examination. In addition, . the . applicant must submit . verifying documentation of his or her history of accommodations, if any. . All doc. umentation will . be retained by the Nebraska State Bar Commission . and may be submitted to one or more. qualified. professionals. for an impartial review. Accommodations granted elsewhere do not . neces. sarily entitle an applica. nt to accommodations on the bar examination, although the . Nebraska State Bar Commission . gives considerable weight to documentation . relating to . past . accommodations received in similar testing situations or in response to an IEP or Section 504 . pla. n. DEFINITIONS. 1. Disa. bility. is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the. major life activities of the applicant.

Applicant Checklist must be completed and . . on or before. th. e filing . deadline of the exam the applicant wishes to take. Applicants with disabilities are . subject. to the same . application. deadline as individuals without . disabilities. .

Provide copies of any . objective evidence of those symptoms, such as report . . cards, teacher comments, tutoring evaluations, etc. . ATTACH A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION REPORT. . The provision of reasonable . accommodations is based on assessment of the . current. impact of the disability on the specific . testing activity. . The . Nebraska State Bar Commission. generally . requires . documentation from an . evaluation conducted within the last . thre. e years to establish the current impact of the disability. . The diagnostic criteria as specified in the . Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental . Disorders, Fourth Edition. (DSM. -IV TR) (or most current version) are used as the basic . guidelines for determin. ation of an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) diagnosis. . The diagnosis depends on objective evidence of AD/HD symptoms that occur early in the . applicant. ™s development and cause the applicant clinically significant impairment within . multiple . environments. . Applicant self. -report alone is generally insufficient to establish evidence . for the diagnosis. . Please provide a comprehensive evaluation report that addresses all five points . below. . . A. Sufficient numbers of symptoms (delineated in DSM. -IV TR) of. inattention and/or . hyperactivity. -impulsivity . that . have persisted for at least six months to a degree that is . ﬁmaladaptive. ﬂ and inconsistent with developmental level. . The exact symptoms should be . described in detail. . B. Objective evidence that symptoms of in. attention and/or hyperactivity. -impulsivity . that . caused impairment . were present during childhood. . C. Objective evidence indicating that current impairment from the symptoms is . observable. in two or more settings. There must be clear evidence of clinically signi. ficant impairment . Form 3. -Page . 4 within the academic setting. However, there must also be evidence that these problems . are not confined to the academic setting. . D. A determination that the symptoms of AD/HD are not a function of some other mental . . disorder (such as a mood, a. nxiety, or personality disorder; psychosis; substance abuse; . low cognitive ability; etc. ) . . E. Indication of the specific AD/HD diagnostic subtype: predominantly inattentive type, . . hyperactive. -impulsive type, combined type, or not otherwise specified. . . III. FOR. MAL TESTING. . Psychological testing and self. -report checklists cannot be used as the sole indicator of AD/HD . diagnosis independent of history and interview. However, such findings can augment clinical . . data. They are particularly necessary to rule out . intellectual limitation as an alternative . . explanation for academic difficulty, to describe type and severity of learning problems, and to . . assess the severity of cognitive deficits associated with AD/HD (inattention, working memory, . . etc. ) . . 1.

No If yes, briefly describe the findings. . Form 3. -Page . 5 4.

No If yes, describe the type of treatment, including . any . medication. , and state the extent to which . this . treatment is . effective in controlling . the AD/HD symptoms.
