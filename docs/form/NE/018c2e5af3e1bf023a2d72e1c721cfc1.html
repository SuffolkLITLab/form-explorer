Application Finalization Information 

In anticipation of submitting your application online (or if you already have done so 
and have made payment), the content of your application has to first be finalized 
which means that no further editing of your typed-in information is allowed after 
submission. It is imperative that the documents you sign and notarize noted below 
match the information saved online. Please review the Completion Checklist below to 
ensure you have included all necessary documentation and have completed all 
required steps for your application. Your application is not complete and considered 
filed with our office until all necessary documents have been uploaded.  

Completion Checklist 

This is a list of duties to be completed to finalize your application. These documents are 
required for both motion applications and exam applications. You may print the checklist for 
future reference. All necessary documents referenced below must be scanned and uploaded in 
“Applicant Documentation” of your account (with the exception of ONLY physical fingerprint 
cards which must be mailed to our office). The “Applicant Documentation” tab is always 
accessible even after you have submitted your application. You will receive an email notification 
from our office indicating when your application has been filed, or if we need more information 
from you before processing can begin.   

 Bar Exam Applicants - Current photo ID (i.e. driver’s license, passport- the photo must

also have identifiers to indicate it is you).

 Bar Exam Applicants wishing to apply for testing accommodations must submit the ADA
Accommodations request forms located on the Nebraska State Bar Commission of the
Nebraska Supreme Court website with their application. Use this link to apply:
https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/NSBC-1-10.pdf.  Once the
documents have been completed, please upload to the “Applicant Documentation” and
title it Testing Accommodations Request.  Please note that these documents must be
submitted by the application deadline to be considered (on-time if you are submitting in
the on-time period).  Please note deadline dates indicated in the request.

 All attorney applicants must provide a current Certificate in Good Standing for each

jurisdiction where you are licensed. Certificate(s) must be dated no earlier than 30 days

entitled to practice law.

 (All applicants) Complete two sets of your fingerprints. Fingerprints are required with
each application submitted in Nebraska. Fingerprints may be made digitally or on
fingerprint cards. If fingerprints are completed on physical fingerprint cards, please mail

current mailing address for them to be mailed to.    
Please remember to complete all applicable identifying information on the fingerprint 
cards, as well as sign and date the cards. Failure to complete all the personal 
information requested on the top portion of both fingerprint cards will cause your 
application to be delayed and/or your fingerprint cards to be rejected.

**If fingerprints are completed on physical cards, they must be mailed to our 
office- do NOT upload them to your application.** 

Applicant Notification and Record Challenge 
Officials at the governmental institutions and other entities authorized to submit fingerprints and 
receive FBI identification records under this authority must notify the individuals fingerprinted that the 
fingerprints will be used to check the criminal history records of the FBI. The officials making the 
determination of suitability for licensing or employment shall provide the applicants the opportunity to 
complete, or challenge the accuracy of, the information contained in the FBI identification record. These 
officials also must advise the applicants that procedures for obtaining a change, correction, or updating 
of an FBI identification record are set forth in Title 28, C.F.R., § 16.34. Officials making such 
determinations should not deny the license or employment based on information in the record until the 
applicant has been afforded a reasonable time to correct or complete the record, or has declined to do 
so. (Title 42, U.S.C., § 14616, Article IV (c); Title 28, C.F.R., § 50.12 (b))

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
