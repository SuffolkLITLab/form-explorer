      <pre>Appendix C. Instructions for Judicial Financial Interest Statement. 

  (A) General information. 

  The Nebraska Revised Code of Judicial Conduct as adopted by the Nebraska Supreme 
Court provides in part that a judge shall regularly file reports of compensation received 
for any extrajudicial activity for which the judge received compensation. A judge shall 
also regularly file reports of personal holdings and of gifts, bequests, favors, and loans 
received of such a nature that the judge's impartiality might reasonably be challenged. 

  All Nebraska judges, and others subject to the reporting requirements of this Code, are 
required to use the form set forth in Appendix B to file such report no later than May 1st 
of each year. Such report shall be created and filed as a public document through an 
electronic filing system provided by the Nebraska Supreme Court and will be publicly 
accessible in the Office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court. Except as otherwise provided 
by the rules of the Supreme Court or this form, all questions regarding filing shall be 
governed by the rules of the Nebraska Revised Code of Judicial Conduct as adopted by 
the Nebraska Supreme Court. 

  This statement must include all financial interests held at any time during the calendar 
year, and may not be limited to interests held at the end of the year. 

  (B) Definitions. 

  “Compensation” (Nebraska Revised Code of Judicial Conduct, Terminology section) 

  Any money or thing of value received, or to be received as a claim on future services, 
whether in the form of a fee, salary, expense, allowance, forbearance, forgiveness, 
interest, dividend, royalty, rent, capital gain, or any other form of recompense then 
constituting income under the Internal Revenue Code. The income must, however, be for 
services and does not include income, interest, or dividends received by reason of 
investment. 

  “Gift” (Nebraska Revised Code of Judicial Conduct, Terminology section) 

  A payment, subscription, advance, forbearance, rendering or deposit of money, 
services, or anything of value, unless consideration of equal or greater value is given 
therefor. Gift shall not include a commercially reasonable loan made in the ordinary 
course of business, a gift received from a member of the judge's family,* a breakfast,

Revised Code of Judicial Conduct, Terminology section).

Rule 3.12. Compensation for extrajudicial activities.

things of value. 

  (A) A judge shall not accept any gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, or other things

person to undermine the judge’s independence,* integrity,* or impartiality.*

accept the following without publicly reporting such acceptance: 

  (1) items with little intrinsic value, such as plaques, certificates, trophies, and

the judge’s family*;

travel, food, lodging, or other incidental expenses, or a waiver or partial waiver

  R

 

 

- 5 - 

   (A) The performance of marriage ceremonies by a judge during courthouse 
hours is permitted if there is no gift, honorarium, or payment of any kind 
received for such service. Courthouse hours include all hours when the court is 
open and in session, or the clerk’s office is open, including noon/lunch hours. 

  (B) A judge may accept a reasonable fee, honorarium, gratuity, gift, or 
contribution* to perform a marriage ceremony during non-courthouse hours, 
whether the ceremony is performed in the court or away from the court. 

  (C) Compensation, fees, honorarium, gratuities, gifts, or contributions derived 
from marriages shall be subject to public reporting. See Rule 3.15. 

  (D) Compensation does not include a meal provided to the judge in connection 
with the celebration of the marriage. 

   

   

   

  (D) Specific instructions for form. 

  When completing this form, a judge should be aware of both the need to provide 
enough detail to satisfy the purpose of financial reporting and the danger of providing too 
much information. Generally, excessive details such as account numbers, brokerage firm 
names, and the like, would not enhance the purpose of the statement but could assist in 
abuse of the information. Specific instructions are provided for items with that caution in 
mind. 

  Item 1: The identifying information entered here (i.e., address, telephone number, 
email) shall be the judge’s official public information, not the personal or unlisted 
information. 

  Item 2: If the value or amount of the compensation is not obvious and cannot be 
discovered with reasonable effort, the judge shall make a reasonable estimate of such 
value or amount. 

  Item 3: If the value or amount of the gift is not obvious and cannot be discovered with 
reasonable effort, the judge shall make a reasonable estimate of such value or amount. 

  Item 4: N/A. 

  Item 5: If the value or amount of the compensation is not obvious and cannot be 
discovered with reasonable effort, the judge shall make a reasonable estimate of such 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

- 6 - 

value or amount. A meal provided in connection with the celebration of the marriage 
shall not be subject to public reporting. 

  Item 6: The judge’s personal residential real estate shall not be subject to public 
reporting. For real estate that is reportable, the county and state where the property is 
located shall be sufficient to describe the location of the judge’s real property. 

  Item 7(B): For individual stocks, the name of the issuing company shall be disclosed 
(e.g., IBM Corporation common stock). For individual bonds, the name of the issuing 
entity shall be disclosed (e.g., U.S. Treasury Direct or Ford Motor Company). For mutual 
or exchange-traded funds, the name of the fund shall be disclosed, but not the fund’s 
holdings (e.g., Fidelity 500 Index Fund). For publicly-traded issues, ticker symbols shall 
be provided (e.g., IBM). Do not provide numbers of shares held, face value of securities, 
account numbers, or names of brokerage firms. 

  Item 7 (C): Describe the nature of the property and the name of the person or entity 
obligated to the judge.  DO NOT INCLUDE the amount or face value of such property 
interests, nor obligations owed to the judge by a member of the judge’s family. 

  Item 8: N/A. 

  Item 9: N/A.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
