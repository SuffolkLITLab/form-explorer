WHAT TO DO WITH THE COMPLETED GENERAL POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM 

Power of Attorney forms do not have to be filed with a court; however, it is very important to keep the 
form in a secure place where it will not be damaged. You should give a copy of the notarized power of 
attorney to your agent. Additionally, it is very important that all people involved with the power of 
attorney form are aware of the location of the form, for future reference. 

NOTE: Every power of attorney ends immediately upon death of the principal.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
