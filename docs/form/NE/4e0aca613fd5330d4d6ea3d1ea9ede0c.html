Some General Principles for Emergencies 
 

1.  Clear-cut level of authority must be established. 
2.  Planning followed by training nourishes calmness in an emergency and instills confidence. 
3.  In the interest of security and protecting people, some inconvenience(s) may have to be imposed. 
4.  Evacuation of disabled applicants deficient in mobility must be given the highest priority in all 

planning for emergencies. 

5.  Evacuation is not always the best procedure to protect people. 
6.  In almost all instances, elevators are not to be used for emergency evacuation. 
7.  In the event of an explosion, have the group take cover under tables or other objects that will give 
protection against falling objects or stand next to an interior wall away from windows and inside 
glass. Move away from heavy objects of unknown stability. 

 

   

     

Basic Rules of Bar Examination Administration 
 

1.  Applicants are to be treated with respect and dignity at all times. 
2.  Be professional and remain calm. 
3.  Stay in control of the situation. 
4.  Do not interrupt testing unless it is absolutely necessary. 
5.  Be constantly aware of the test time. 

uring the course of every administration of an examination, incidents, emergencies, and disruptions may 

occur. The range in complexity is enormous. This handbook will provide you with the necessary 
guidelines to assist you in the handling of emergency situations as well as general guidelines that should 
be applied to any and all situations. Every incident is unique and therefore good common sense should be 
used along with these basic guidelines. 

ersonal or Environmental Disruptions 

f an applicant who becomes ill or injured during a session of an examination is able to return to the 
examination, extra or extended time generally should not be given. However, if an injury or loss of time 
has been inadvertently caused through negligence or accident by the contracted test site, personnel, or 
staff, extended time any be given. (For example, if a chair breaks, the applicant might be granted 
extended time equal to that which was lost from when the chair breaks to when the applicant is settled 
into a new chair.) 

ajor Disruption 

 major disruption is defined as an individual or site incident that could result in disruption to a 
significant percentage of the applicants, when the event is disturbing and protracted and has been 
witnessed by a significant percentage of the applicants. In determining to treat an event as a Major 
Disruption, the following factors should be taken into consideration: 
 

1.  Percentage of applicants affected. 
2.  Location in the test site where disruption occurred. 
3.  Duration of the incident, how much time. 
4.  Audio: how loud was it? 
5.  Visual: what could people see? 
6.  Smell: type and strength of odor? 
7.  At what point in the session did the incident occur? How much time has elapsed since the session 

was started? How much time remains? 

8.  Which day of the examination, Tuesday or Wednesday, did the incident occur and what session 

of the examination was being given (AM or PM)? 

f after consideration of the above factors, it appears that the incident should not be considered a Major 
Disruption and that only a small number of applicants were affected, the following additional criteria 
should be considered prior to making a decision to extend additional time to complete the examination 
session: 
 

1.  Was the incident of a nature that required assistance from the applicant? 
2.  Did staff give the applicant directions to return to the examination (whether the applicant 

followed the directions issued by the staff and whether the directions issued by the staff were 
appropriate)? 

3.  Exactly how much time was lost by the applicant due to the incident? 

olicies and Procedures to Be Followed in Case of Emergencies 

uring the examination, the Site Supervisor and staff members will be wearing radios so they can be 
immediately contacted in the event of an emergency. The Site Supervisor must rapidly go to the site of 
any incident or emergency and quickly assess the situation. If the situation requires it, 911 should be

Introduction 

called immediately. The safety of the applicants, proctors, and staff is always of primary concern. The 
director of admissions must be contacted promptly and given a report of the incident or emergency. If 911 
is called, the Site Supervisor should immediately notify facility staff so that they can assist in meeting the 
emergency personnel and directing them to the appropriate location. 

n any situation where a dispute arises, the Site Supervisor or staff member should attempt to calm the 
applicant and inform the applicant that the matter is being reported to the director of admissions so that a 
decision can be made on how to proceed. As with any incident, the “Emergency Report” form (Form A) 
should be completed by the Site Supervisor as soon as possible. 

ncorrect Set-Up at Facility and Temperature Control 

hen the Site Supervisor arrives at the test site, the set-up of the facility should be checked immediately. 

If the facility is not set-up correctly, facility staff should be contacted for an explanation as well as a 
completed set-up time. The facility staff must quickly do whatever is necessary to have the facility set-up 
correctly. This includes a comfortable temperature. 

elayed Starting Time 

hile there may be very good reasons for delaying the examination, every attempt should be made to 

start the examination on time. If time permits, the Site Supervisor should contact the director of 
admissions to report the delay and get instructions on when to begin the afternoon session. The director of 
admissions will advise of the correct action to take, but in any event, the afternoon session should not 
begin less than 1 hour after the applicants have been dismissed from the morning session. 

n the event of a natural disaster, the director of admissions should be contacted prior to the start of the 
examination, as soon as the problem is identified. If the decision is made to give all applicants extra time, 
the Speaker will be directed to make such an announcement. If a decision is made to give individual 
applicants extra time, a board staff member will advise each affected applicant that he/she has been 
granted a certain amount of extra time. The applicant will be instructed to continue the examination after 
the other applicants have been dismissed. The applicant will be stopped individually when the extra time 
is up. 

xtended Time 

incident is not given. 

enerally, extended time to complete an examination session by the amount of time lost due to a personal 

f it is determined that a Major Disruption has occurred or that a small number of applicants have been 
negatively affected by a circumstance beyond their control and that it is possible to maintain the integrity 
of the testing environment, then the examination can be stopped for up to 1½ hours if the test site can 
accommodate the extended time. The Speaker should begin to read the disruption text that is attached as 
Appendix A to this Emergency Preparedness Plan. This should only be read after receiving instructions 
from the director of admissions to do so. 

or a small number of applicants who have been granted extended time, an additional room should be 
located and set up so that at the conclusion of the examination, the applicants can be escorted to the room 
and advised of the additional time they have to complete the session. If an extra room is not available, an 
isolated space in the test site should be identified and set up. The applicants should be escorted to this 
isolated space upon the conclusion of the regular session.

If the examination is restarted, the applicants should be given exactly the amount of time that was lost. Up 
to an additional 10 minutes can be given for the applicants to get re-oriented, but that time should not be 
used as extra time to finish that portion of the examination. 

estart or Dismiss 

fter a determination to stop an examination has been made, the director of admissions needs to 

determine whether to restart the examination or dismiss the examinees for the session. An examination 
can be restarted after the following criteria have been considered: 
 

1.  Has it been less than 90 minutes since the examination was stopped? 
2.  Have the number of people at the test site maintained satisfactory control? 
3.  Has the testing environment been maintained (test materials secure, applicants kept isolated and 

quiet)? 

4.  Is the test site available to accommodate the applicants who have been granted extended time? 

 decision to dismiss should occur if the criteria could not be met. 

ate Arrival of Individual Applicants 

o applicant will be allowed in the examination room once the Site Supervisor begins reading the 

instructions. A “Record of Irregularity” form (Form B) will be filled out with regard to the late applicant. 

isputed Time Announcements 

he Site Supervisor is responsible for the accuracy of time announcements. The Site Supervisor will stand 

at the podium to ensure the announcements are the correct time and given at the appropriate time. If an 
applicant disputes a time announcement, the Site Supervisor should be contacted immediately. The Site 
Supervisor should report any such dispute to the director of admissions and complete a “Record of 
Irregularity” form (Form B). 

looding, Etc., at Facility 

s soon as such an incident is determined, the Site Supervisor must contact the director of admissions 
immediately. Several proctors should be assigned to the entrances of the examination room to advise the 
applicants that the situation is being assessed and further information will be provided as soon as it 
becomes available. Facility staff should be contacted immediately to determine what can be done to 
rectify the situation and make whatever arrangements are necessary to start the examination on time or as 
close to on time as possible. 

ire Drills 

he Site Supervisor should immediately determine if the fire alarm is a drill or an actual alarm. If it is a 

drill, the Site Supervisor should immediately contact facility staff and have the alarm shut off. The 
director of admissions should then be contacted to determine if the disruption was significant enough to 
warrant the granting of additional testing time. If the alarm is valid, the procedures for the evacuation of 
the facility, stated below, should be followed.

vacuation of Facility 

efore the examination, you should review the set-up diagram of the facility to familiarize yourself with 
the location of all exits. If time permits, the director of admissions should be contacted immediately and 
evacuation procedures should be followed. The examination must be stopped and the time noted. The 
proctors should begin to move the applicants out of the building. The applicants may resist all efforts to 
be “herded.” However, sufficient presence should be displayed to avoid panic. A calm, solicitous 
approach, suggesting that the orderly and rapid exit and reassembly is to the applicant’s personal 
advantage is much more likely to result in a successful emergency exit than is an attitude on the part of 
the proctors which tends to demand military precision or gives the impression of such demands. If there is 
time, proctors should collect all examination materials. If there is a threat of fire, the last person out 
should close the doors. If there is a bomb threat, the doors should be left open. 

s time passes, control of the applicant population will begin to diminish. Orderly waiting in the 

assembly area for a period much in excess of 1 hour is probably an unrealistic expectation. If at the close 
of 1 hour, there is insufficient information to permit a reentry decision or should a normal break time such 
as lunch occur while the applicant population is in the assembly area, the Site Supervisor should consider 
dismissing the applicants and asking them to return to the ASSEMBLY AREA at the next regularly 
scheduled reporting time. This is true even if the next reporting time is the next morning. The Site 
Supervisor should make a detailed record of that which transpired on the “Record of Irregularity” form 
(Form B). A survey of the secure papers (i.e., all of the materials in use at the time of the exit such as 
question and answer books) should be made prior to reentry. 

ecall and Reentry 

f it has been determined that the site is safely inhabitable within a short period of time, the Speaker 
should make an announcement advising the applicants in the assembly area of the nature of the 
disruption, the current conditions, and that the examination will continue with the announced schedule. 

n the event some of the applicants refuse to reenter the site, they should be asked to sign a “Refusal to 
Reenter” form (Form C). If they refuse, their applicant examination numbers should be recorded and their 
admission tickets should be collected. 

oise From Another Group Using Facility 

he Site Supervisor must go directly to the facility staff and demand that the noise he stopped. If the 

facility staff does comply with the demand, the director of admissions should be contacted as soon as the 
problem has been resolved with the action that was taken. If the facility staff refused to comply with the 
demand, the Site Supervisor must contact the director of admissions immediately. 

hen noise problems occur outside of the facility, the Site Supervisor must immediately go to the source 
of the noise and attempt to get the noise stopped. The Site Supervisor should then return to the room and 
make notes regarding the problem. An exact diagram of the room should be drawn so that the director of 
admissions will know exactly which of the applicants were affected by the noise problem. Make sure 
proctors in the area write a detailed incident report on the “Record of Irregularity” form (Form B). If the 
Site Supervisor is unsuccessful in stopping the noise, the director of admissions should be contacted to 
determine a course of action. Any of the Applicants who complain should be moved to another area if 
there is space available. It may be determined that the examination will be stopped until the noise ceases; 
however, the director of admissions can only make that decision.

Electrical Problems 

f supplemental lighting fails, the Site Supervisor should go to the area and determine the extent of the 
problem. In many cases, there will be sufficient light to continue the examination. The Site Supervisor 
should determine how many of the applicants might potentially request to be moved. The Site Supervisor 
should then attempt to locate seats in which they can be moved. The exact location of the seating change 
must be noted. During the lunch break, the Site Supervisor should contact the Facility Staff to have any 
lighting problems corrected before the start of the next session. 

n the event of a power outage, the exact time of the outage and the length of time of the outage should be 
documented. The Site Supervisor should notify the director of admissions immediately of any such 
outage. The applicants should be given additional time that is equal to the length of time of the outage. 

lease note: The Site Supervisor should first check to see if the electrical problem may have been caused 

by plugs being kicked out of wall or floor outlets. 

pplicants Leaving Examination Room 

ny applicant who leaves the examination room prior to completing the session should not be readmitted. 

If he/she objects, the director of admissions should be contacted immediately to report the situation and 
ask for guidance. 

pplicants Who Fail to Write Answers on Answer Sheets 

t is an applicant’s responsibility to make a good faith attempt on all portions of the examination. If an 
applicant fails to record any answers on the essay examination, he/she shall not be permitted to sit for any 
remaining sessions of the examination. 

BE Answer Sheet 

f an applicant marks circles (M/C) in their question book, contact the director of admissions for 
guidance. 

pplicants Who Fail to Report for Any Session 

ll of the applicants are required to sit for both sessions on both days of the examination. If an applicant 
does not report for testing for the morning session of the first day, the applicant’s seating card should be 
pulled during the lunch break. If the applicant then attempts to report for testing after not sitting for the 
morning session the first day, he/she should be instructed that he/she is no longer eligible to sit for the 
examination and must leave the testing room. The Site Supervisor should then be contacted.  

eople Wanting to Learn Whereabouts of Applicants 

ll applicant information is confidential, and no staff member or proctor is to release any information 
regarding the whereabouts of an applicant. If the inquirer states that it is an emergency, the information 
should be taken and the director of admissions must be contacted immediately for further guidance. No 
indication is to be given regarding whether or not an applicant is present. These instructions relate to the 
media and law enforcement personnel as well.

Possible Imposters 

n the possibility that an imposter is suspected of taking the examination for someone else, the incident 
must be well documented. The Site Supervisor and the Section Supervisor must provide a detailed 
description of the applicant; carefully observe the applicant involved and state, in detail, the reason for 
suspecting that the applicant is an imposter. Do not interrupt the applicant or otherwise disturb him/her. 
During the roll call portion of the examination, the Section Supervisor should pay extra attention that the 
photo identification provided is valid. The director of admissions should be contacted immediately to 
report the suspected imposter. The Site Supervisor should clandestinely take the suspected imposter’s 
photograph with the digital camera (at each test site). 

llness of Applicants 

f an applicant becomes ill during the examination, but not so ill that the applicant requires immediate 
medical attention, all attempts should be made to accommodate the applicant. The Site Supervisor should 
be contacted. During a break in testing, the applicant should be moved to a more conducive location, if 
seating is available, such as close to the rest rooms. Do not move the applicant during testing. 

omplaints of Harassment by Proctors 

he Site Supervisor should go to the spot and observe the situation. After the session is complete, he/she 

should interview the complaining applicant. The Site Supervisor should not get involved with an 
argument or take either side. It is his/her primary responsibility to calm both parties and gather facts. 

he Site Supervisor should advise the complaining applicant that the matter will be reported in detail to 
the director of admissions and that if he/she wishes to file an additional statement, it should be forwarded 
to the director of admissions. The Site Supervisor should offer to move the applicant to a vacant seat in 
another section. The Site Supervisor should get a detailed account of the incident from the proctor and 
submit it in conjunction with his/her report of the incident. 

he Site Supervisor and security personnel should observe the applicant and immediately determine if the 

applicant should be moved to another area of the testing room, or escorted out of the testing room. The 
Site Supervisor should contact the director of admissions prior to having the applicant leave the testing 
room. 

dors may emanate from inside or from outside the facility. If the smells are from inside the facility, 

contact the facility staff immediately. It may be necessary to open the doors. If the smells are from outside 
the facility, the Site Supervisor should observe the area to determine the source of the odor, and then 
enlist the help of the facility staff in eliminating the problem. 

nruly Applicants 

dors 

ypographical Errors 

f such an error is reported, the director of admissions should be contacted immediately. Make no 
comment to any proctor or applicant regarding the error. Advise anyone inquiring about the error that the 
matter is being reported and that they should answer the question as stated. If the applicant feels there is 
an issue, the applicant should submit a detailed written description to the director of admissions 
immediately after the bar examination has concluded.

otice of the possibility of a condition that might require the emergency exit from an examination site 

can arrive from a variety of sources. Possibly an applicant may return from lunch with a rumor of a 
planned disruption which he or she has overheard. A member of the facility staff may report some 
reference to an emergency. A bomb threat might be incoming on the telephone. Irrespective of the source 
and nature of the information received, the recipient should gain all possible information. The “Response 
to Personally Delivered Threat Information” form (From D) should be made available in all sections. 
Upon rapid, thorough, and accurate completion of the form, it should be quickly hand-delivered to either 
the director of admissions or Site Supervisor, whoever happens to be the most readily available. 

n the event the threat is such that the site will probably be uninhabitable preventing reentry, a dismissal 
exit should occur, but must first be approved by the director of admissions. The time remaining in the 
session would also be a consideration. If there is only the threat of unknown validity, the emergency 
should be thoroughly analyzed before the exit is ordered.  

eath or Serious Injury Notification 

f a staff member or proctor is contacted and requested to advise an applicant that someone close to them 
is near death or has died, obtain all the pertinent information from the caller. The information, at a 
minimum, should include the caller’s name, address, and contact phone number(s), the name of the 
individual in question, including their location and status and who the applicant should contact. 
Additionally, ascertain if the applicant is aware of the situation, i.e., very sick relative already in the 
hospital vs. a sudden accidental death. 

he director of admissions must be advised before any action is taken or the applicant is notified. The 
director of admissions or, if delegated, the Site Supervisor will personally make the notification. Before 
notification, consider how much testing time is remaining in the session and evaluate if it would be better 
to delay the notification until after testing. The applicant must be positively identified by verifying both 
the section seating roster and the applicant’s photo identification displayed on the testing table. Once 
identified, quietly request the applicant to accompany you outside of the main testing room and into a 
private area. A section proctor should collect the applicant’s test materials. Again, verbally confirm the 
applicant’s identity before you deliver the information. You should have the EMT nearby to assist the 
applicant with any emotional trauma. Be sympathetic and reassure the applicant, but do not make any 
promises regarding the status of the applicant’s bar examination completion. If the applicant decides to 
continue testing, determine if he/she should be returned to the same seat or if he/she should utilize a 
private area to continue testing. Normally, a separate area would be more appropriate and all lost time due 
to the notification and reseating should be added to the applicant’s test time. 

edia Coverage (TV, Newspapers, Magazines, Etc.) 

f media personnel, such as reporters or camera men, are present at the bar examination site, the Site 
Supervisor or his/her designee must notify the director of admissions as soon as possible. Only the Site 
Supervisor is authorized to speak to the media and then, can ONLY discuss topics regarding general bar 
examination information that could be found on the Board’s Web site. It must be remembered that ALL 
applicant information, including their identity, is confidential. All other staff and proctors should direct 
any media inquiries or contacts to the Site Supervisor and not discuss or answer any questions regarding 
the bar examination process. DO NOT permit any media personnel, with or without cameras, into the test 
site area including the applicant lobby. The Site Supervisor should interact with the media outside of the 
testing environment if possible. If the media personnel want to interview the applicants outside of the 
testing area, that is allowed as the applicants cannot be prevented from being interviewed in a public area.

Receipt of Threat to Safety 

However, if the applicants are in the test room and about to be dismissed, notify them of the media’s 
presence and location. The Site Supervisor or his/her assistant should attempt to provide an alternate exit 
for the applicants who want to avoid the media. Be professional at all times when dealing with the media.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
