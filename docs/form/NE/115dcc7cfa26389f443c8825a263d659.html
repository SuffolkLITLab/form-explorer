      <pre>APPENDIX C 

POLICY ON APPLICANTS WITH A DISABILITY 

I. POLICY. It is the policy of the Nebraska State Bar Commission to administer the bar examination in a 
manner that does not discriminate, on the basis of disability, against a qualified applicant with a disability. 
An applicant who is otherwise eligible to take the Nebraska bar examination may file a request for special 
testing accommodations. 

I. DEFINITIONS. For the purpose of this policy, the following definitions shall apply: 

  A. "Disability" means any of the following: 

 
1.  A  physical  or  mental  impairment  that  substantially  limits  one  or  more  of  the  major  life 
activities  of  the  applicant  and  that  substantially  limits  the  ability  of  the  applicant  to  demonstrate, 
under  standard  testing  conditions,  that  the  applicant  possesses  the  essential  skills,  level  of 
achievement,  and  aptitudes  that  the  Nebraska  Supreme  Court  and  the  commission  require  for 
admission to the practice of law in Nebraska; 

2. A record of having such an impairment; 

 

 

3. Being regarded as having such an impairment. 

B. "Qualified applicant with a disability" means an applicant with a disability who, with or without 
 
reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices; the removal of architectural, communication, or 
transportation  barriers;  or  the  provision  of  auxiliary  aids  and  services,  meets  the  essential  eligibility 
requirements for admission to the practice of law in Nebraska. 

C.  "Reasonable  accommodation"  means  an  adjustment  or  modification  of  the  standard  testing 

 
conditions that ameliorates the impact of the applicant's disability without doing any of the following: 

1. Fundamentally altering the nature of the examination or the commission's ability to determine 
 
through the bar examination whether the applicant possesses the essential skills, level of achievement, 
and aptitudes that are among the essential eligibility requirements set forth in rule 3, that the Nebraska 
Supreme Court and the commission have determined are required for admission to the practice of law 
in Nebraska; 

2. Imposing an undue burden on the commission; 

3. Compromising the security of the examination; 

4. Compromising the integrity, the reliability, or the validity of the examination.

  A. Procedures for Review of Requests 

  I

1. The commission will review all requests for special testing accommodations that are properly 

 
filed in accordance with this policy. 

(a) Requests that are not timely filed, that are incomplete, or that otherwise do not comply with 

 
the requirements of this policy may be rejected for consideration by the commission. 

(b)  The  commission  may  ask  an  applicant  to  submit  additional  information  to  support  the 

 
applicant's request. 

(c) The commission may seek the assistance of a medical, psychological, or other authority of the

(d) The commission may ask the applicant to submit to an independent evaluation conducted by 

 
an appropriate health care professional selected by the commission. 

 

(e) The cost of the independent evaluation shall be paid by the commission. 

 

 

2. In reviewing a request, the commission will follow these procedures. 

(a)  The  commission  will  make  a  determination,  and  the  director  of  the  commission  will  send 

 
notification of the determination to the applicant, no fewer than 25 days before the examination. 

 
(b) The commission's denial of a request will be in writing and sent to the applicant by certified 
mail to the address provided by the applicant on the request. The commission's denial will include a 
statement  of  the  commission's  reasons  for  denial.  The  commission  will  also  provide  the  applicant 
with a copy of the written report of any expert it consulted in reviewing the request. 

(c)  The  applicant  may  appeal  the  denial  of  a  request  to  the  Supreme  Court  in  accordance  with

(b) the special testing accommodations are necessary to ameliorate the impact of the applicant's 

 
disability; 

(c) the special testing accommodations are reasonable accommodations. 

 
2. The commission will have sole discretion to determine what special testing accommodations 
are reasonable accommodations. The commission may provide accommodations different from those 
requested  by  the  applicant  if  the  commission  determines  that  the  accommodations  provided  will 
effectively ameliorate the impact of the applicant's disability. 

3. No special testing accommodation granted pursuant to this policy will alter in any manner the 

 
limitation otherwise imposed on the length of an applicant's answers. 

4.  If an applicant is permitted to dictate answers to the essay portion of the examination, those 

 
answers will be transcribed by personnel selected solely by the commission for that purpose. 

 

 

 

V. CONFIDENTIALITY 

  All  requests  for  special  testing  accommodations,  supporting  documentation,  and  information 
developed  by  the  commission  with  respect  to  the  requests  will  remain  confidential;  however,  the 
commission  may  reveal  the  contents  of  applications  to  its  experts  in  assessing  and  commenting  on  the 
matters contained in the applications.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
