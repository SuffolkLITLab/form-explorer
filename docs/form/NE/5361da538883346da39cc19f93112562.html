      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE FINANCIAL AFFIDAVIT FOR 
CHILD SUPPORT 

HEADING 

a. Choose the county in the drop down box below the first blank. This is where the case is

or will be filed in the first blank.

b. Enter the name of the plaintiff. If you are filing the original action, for example, if you are
filing a dissolution of marriage or a paternity case, you are the plaintiff. If a case has
already been filed, and this action is for a modification, or for enforcement of the order,
put the name of the person who was listed as the plaintiff in the original case.

c. Enter the name of the defendant. If you are filing the original action, for example, if you
are filing a dissolution of marriage case, the other party is the defendant. In a paternity
case, the child’s other parent is the defendant. If a case has already been filed, put the
name of the person who was listed as the defendant in the original case.

d. If this is a new case, the clerk of the court will give you a case number when you file the
action. If this is an existing case, you will enter the case number that is on the order from
the original case. You must include the case number on any papers you file.

d. 

BODY OF AFFIDAVIT 
f. Enter your name in the first paragraph. This paragraph does not have a number.

The numbers below give instructions for completing the paragraphs with the same numbers in 
the Affidavit. 

Paragraph 1.  Enter the type of case that this is for in the blank.  To complete this paragraph 

you must check only the box that applies. If there are no orders for child support 
in any other court case, you must check the first box. If there is another order for 
child support in this state or any other state, you must check the second box and 
enter the name of the court (for example, District Court of Douglas County or 
Lancaster County Juvenile Court), the case number, the amount of support, and 
the number of children.

(b) 

Paragraph 2. Enter the name of your current employer and the amount of your monthly income 

before any deductions (gross income). You should include overtime if the 
overtime is a regular part of the employment and you can actually expect to 
regularly earn a certain amount of income from working overtime. If you are not 
employed enter “not employed” on the first line and go to the next paragraph. 

(a) 

(a)

Here is how to figure monthly income. All income should be annualized and divided
by 12. For example:
(1)

If a person is paid hourly, the hourly rate should be multiplied by the number
of hours worked per week. That figure should be multiplied by 52 and then
divided by 12. This would be a person’s monthly wage (hourly rate x number
of hours worked per week x 52 weeks in a year ÷ 12 months in a year =
monthly wage).
If a person is paid a weekly salary, the weekly salary should be multiplied by
52 and then divided by 12. This would be a person’s monthly wage (weekly
salary x 52 weeks in a year ÷ 12 months in a year = monthly salary).
If a person is paid a salary every other week, the amount of salary paid
should be multiplied by 26 and then divided by 12. This would be a person’s
monthly wage (salary paid every two weeks x 26 pay periods in a year ÷ 12
months in a year = monthly salary).

If a person is paid a salary two times a month, the amount of
salary paid should be multiplied by 24 and then divided by 12. This would be
a person’s monthly wage (salary paid two times a month x 24 pay periods in
a year ÷ 12 months in a year = monthly salary).

(b)

To state the basis of your gross monthly income, you must check only the
box that applies. If you are paid by the hour, check the first box and enter the
amount per hour you are paid and then enter the number of hours per week you
work. If you are paid a salary, check the second box and enter the amount of your
monthly salary. If you are paid bonuses, enter the amount of your bonuses.

Paragraph 3.  Enter the name of the other party’s current employer and the amount of their 
income before any deductions (gross income).  You should include overtime if 
the overtime is a regular part of the employment and the other party can actually 
expect to regularly earn a certain amount of income from working overtime. If the 
other party is not employed enter “not employed” on the first line and go to the 
next paragraph.

Paragraph 4:  If your current income represents your ability to earn income you do not have to 

complete this paragraph. 

(a) If you are capable of earning greater income than you are currently
earning, you must complete this paragraph. You must state the
name of the employer where you earned a greater wage and the
amount of the income before any deductions.

4. 

(b) To state the basis of this gross monthly income, you must check only the

hours per week you worked.  If you were paid a salary, check the second
box and enter the amount of your monthly salary. If you were paid
bonuses, enter the amount of your bonuses.

Paragraph 5.  If you would like child support calculated on the basis of the other party’s 

current income, you do not have to complete this paragraph. But if you 
believe the other party is capable of earning greater income than what is 
currently being earned, you should complete this paragraph. 

(a) If you believe the other party is capable of earning greater income, you
must state the reason for your claim by entering the name of the past
employer and the amount of the income before any deductions.

(b) To state the basis of this gross monthly income, you must check only the
box that applies. If the other party was paid by the hour, check the first
box and enter the amount per hour the other party was paid and then
enter the number of hours per week they worked. If the other party was
paid a salary, check the second box and enter the amount of their
monthly salary.  If the other party was paid bonuses, enter the amount of

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
