Separate here and give Form W-4N to your employer or payor. Keep the bottom part for your records.

Personal Allowances Worksheet 
• Keep for your records.

Allowances approximate tax deductions that may reduce your tax liability. The number of allowances is determined by many factors 
including, but not limited to, filing status, how many jobs you have, and how many children or dependents that you claim on your income 
tax return. 

Allowances claimed on the Form W-4N are used by your employer or payor to determine the Nebraska state income tax withheld from 
your wages, pension, or annuity to meet your Nebraska state income tax obligation.

•  You are single and have only one job; 
•  You are single and have only one pension; 
•  You are married, have only one job, and your spouse does not work; or 
•  Your wages from a second job, or your spouse’s wages (or the total of both for the year) are $1,500

Instructions
Purpose. The Nebraska WIthholding Allowance Certificate, Nebraska Form W-4N, was developed due to significant 
differences between the federal and Nebraska laws regarding standard deductions and because personal exemption 
credits are allowed on the Nebraska income tax return.

The Nebraska Form W-4N will be used by your employer in conjunction with the Nebraska Circular EN to determine 
the correct Nebraska income tax withholding. For every federal Form W-4 employers receive, after January 1, 2020 
a Nebraska Form W-4N must be completed. If you did not complete a federal Form W-4 prior to January 1, 2020 
or  beginning  January  1,  2020  completed  a  federal  Form  W-4  but  did  not  submit  a  Nebraska  Form  W-4N,  your 
employer must withhold as if you were single and claimed no withholding allowances. 

Nebraska taxpayers that receive pension or annuity payments may also use a Nebraska Form W-4N to determine the 
correct withholding for those payments. Beginning January 1, 2022, the Nebraska Form W-4N will be used by your 
pension or annuity payor in conjunction with the Nebraska Circular EN to determine the correct Nebraska income 
tax withholding when the federal Form W-4P is completed on or after January 1, 2022.

Withholding  allowances  directly  affect  how  much  money  is  withheld.  The  amount  withheld  is  reduced  for  each 
allowance taken. Depending on your personal circumstances, you may not want to claim every allowance you are 
eligible to take. If you do not have enough state income tax withheld, you may incur a penalty for underpayment of 
estimated tax. 

There  are  penalties  for  not  paying  enough  Nebraska  income  tax  during  the  year,  either  through  withholding    or 
estimated tax payments. You may want to complete the worksheet in the Nebraska Individual Estimated Income Tax 
Payment Vouchers booklet to compute an estimated tax liability. 

For Employees
Complete the Nebraska Form W-4N so your employer can withhold the correct Nebraska income tax from your 
wage payment. When your personal or financial situation changes, consider completing a new Nebraska Form W-4N.

If  you  are  an  employee  claiming  exemption  from  withholding,  skip  lines  1  and  2,  write  “exempt”  on  line  3,  and 
sign the form to validate it. An exemption is valid for only 1 year. You must give your employer a new Nebraska 
Form W-4N by February 15 each year to continue your exemption.You cannot claim exemption from withholding if 
another person can claim you on their tax return; and your total income exceeds $1,100 and includes more than $350 
of unearned income.

If your employer is subject to the special withholding procedures specified in the Nebraska Circular EN, you may be 
required to submit documentation to your employer to support your claim for  exemption from withholding.

For Employers
An employer may withhold an amount that is less than 1.5% of the employee’s taxable wages if the employee provides 
sufficient  documentation  to  verify  that  a  lesser  amount  of  income  tax  withholding  is  justified  in  the  employee’s 
particular circumstance. Documentation may include: 

 

 

 

•   Verification of the number of children/dependents;

•   Marital status; or 

•   The amount of itemized deductions. 

Without documentation, the employee’s income tax withholding must be set either at 1.5% or within the non-shaded 
area of the income tax withholding tables in the Nebraska Circular EN for the employee's taxable wage. 

Penalties.  An  employer  may  be  subject  to  a  penalty  of  up  to  $1,000  for  each  employee  under-withheld  if  the 
employee’s low income tax withholding is not substantiated.

A taxpayer who intentionally claims an excessive number of exemptions is guilty of a Class II misdemeanor. 

Any person who willfully attempts to evade the Nebraska income tax is guilty of a Class IV felony. 

Any person who willfully fails to withhold, deduct, and truthfully account for and pay over any income tax withheld 
is guilty of a Class IV felony. 

           Pensions and Annuities 
For periodic payments of employer-provided pensions and annuities, the income tax withholding is determined in 
the same manner as income tax withholding from wages. Payees with periodic payments from employer-provided 
pensions and annuities are subject to Nebraska income tax withholding when the payee (recipient) has elected the 
payor to withhold federal income tax from the payments. Payors must use the same number of allowances and the 
marital  status  as  claimed  by  the  payee  on  the  Withholding  Certificate  for  Pension  or  Annuity  Payments,  Federal 
Form W-4P, filed with the payor if the federal Form W-4P was completed prior to January 1, 2022. If the payee 
completes a federal Form W-4P on or after January 1, 2022, a Nebraska Form W-4N must be completed for Nebraska 
income tax withholding purposes.

Payees that chose not to have federal income tax withheld on the federal Form W-4P may elect to be exempt from 
withholding income tax for Nebraska on the Nebraska Form W-4N. Payees completing the Nebraska Form W-4N 
may skip lines 1 and 2 and write “exempt” on line 3 of the Nebraska Form W-4N. If you change the federal Form W-4P 
to withhold federal income tax, you must complete a new Nebraska Form W-4N to withhold Nebraska income tax.   

For pension and annuity payments, the Nebraska Form W-4N exemption stays in effect until you change the  federal 
Form W-4P to withhold federal income tax or you change the Form W-4N to withhold Nebraska income tax without  
changing the federal Form W-4P to withhold federal income tax.  

Note: Nonperiodic payments or eligible rollover distributions  are subject to Nebraska income tax to be withheld at a 
rate of 5% of the distributions and cannot be exempt from income tax withholding. 

For  nonperiodic  payments  or  eligible  rollover  distributions  subject  to  either  the  10%  or  20%  federal  income  tax 
withholding rate, Nebraska income tax will be withheld at a rate of 5% of the distribution. A taxpayer may request 
to have additional Nebraska income tax withheld by completing a Nebraska Form W-4N.  Do not give a federal 
Form W-4P to your payor unless you want an additional amount withheld for Nebraska income tax. Also payees who 
are not required to have federal income tax withheld, may request to have state income tax withheld by completing a 
Nebraska Form W-4N.

Anti-Discrimination Notice. It is illegal to discriminate against work-authorized individuals in hiring, firing, recruitment or 
referral for a fee, or in the employment eligibility verification (Form I-9 and E-Verify) process based on that individual's 
citizenship status, immigration status or national origin. Employers CANNOT specify which document(s) the employee may 
present to establish employment authorization. The employer must allow the employee to choose the documents to be presented 
from the Lists of Acceptable Documents, found on the last page of Form I-9. The refusal to hire or continue to employ an 
individual because the documentation presented has a future expiration date may also constitute illegal discrimination. For more 
information, contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division at 
https://www.justice.gov/ier. 

What is the Purpose of This Form? 

Employers must complete Form I-9 to document verification of the identity and employment authorization of each new 
employee (both citizen and noncitizen) hired after November 6, 1986, to work in the United States. In the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), employers must complete Form I-9 to document verification of the identity and employment 
authorization of each new employee (both citizen and noncitizen) hired after November 27, 2011. 

General Instructions 

Both employers and employees are responsible for completing their respective sections of Form I-9. For the purpose of 
completing this form, the term “employer” means all employers, including those recruiters and referrers for a fee who are 
agricultural associations, agricultural employers, or farm labor contractors, as defined in section 3 of the Migrant and Seasonal 
Agricultural Worker Protection Act, Public Law 97-470 (29 U.S.C. 1802). An “employee” is a person who performs labor or 
services in the United States for an employer in return for wages or other remuneration. The term “Employee” does not include 
those who do not receive any form of remuneration (volunteers), independent contractors or those engaged in certain casual 
domestic employment. Form I-9 has three sections. Employees complete Section 1. Employers complete Section 2 and, when 
applicable, Section 3. Employers may be fined if the form is not properly completed. See 8 USC § 1324a and 8 CFR § 274a.10. 
Individuals may be prosecuted for knowingly and willfully entering false information on the form. Employers are responsible for 
retaining completed forms. Do not mail completed forms to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 

These instructions will assist you in properly completing Form I-9. The employer must ensure that all pages of the instructions 
and Lists of Acceptable Documents are available, either in print or electronically, to all employees completing this form. When 
completing the form on a computer, the English version of the form includes specific instructions for each field and drop-down 
lists for universally used abbreviations and acceptable documents. To access these instructions, move the cursor over each field 
or click on the question mark symbol ( 
instructions at any time by clicking the Instructions button at the top of each page when completing the form on a computer that 
is connected to the Internet. 

) within the field. Employers and employees can also access this full set of 

Employers and employees may choose to complete any or all sections of the form on paper or using a computer, or a 
combination of both. Forms I-9 obtained from the USCIS website are not considered electronic Forms I-9 under DHS 
regulations and, therefore, cannot be electronically signed. Therefore, regardless of the method you used to enter information 
into each field, you must print a hard copy of the form, then sign and date the hard copy by hand where required. 

Employers can obtain a blank copy of Form I-9 from the USCIS website at https://www.uscis.gov/i-9. This form is in portable 
document format (.pdf) that is fillable and savable. That means that you may download it, or simply print out a blank copy to 
enter information by hand. You may also request paper Forms I-9 from USCIS. 

Certain features of Form I-9 that allow for data entry on personal computers may make the form appear to be more than two 
pages. When using a computer, Form I-9 has been designed to print as two pages. Using more than one preparer and/or 
translator will add an additional page to the form, regardless of your method of completion. You are not required to print, retain 
or store the page containing the Lists of Acceptable Documents.

The form will also populate certain fields with N/A when certain user choices ensure that particular fields will not be 
completed. The Print button located at the top of each page that will print any number of pages the user selects. Also, the Start 
Over button located at the top of each page will clear all the fields on the form. 

The Spanish version of Form I-9 does not include the additional instructions and drop-down lists described above. Employers 
in Puerto Rico may use either the Spanish or English version of the form. Employers outside of Puerto Rico must retain the 
English version of the form for their records, but may use the Spanish form as a translation tool. Additional guidance to 
complete the form may be found in the Handbook for Employers: Guidance for Completing Form I-9 (M-274) and on USCIS’ 
Form I-9 website, I-9 Central.

translator must check the box marked “A preparer(s) and/or translator(s) assisted the employee in completing Section 1”, 
then select the number of Certification areas needed from the dropdown provided. Any additional Certification areas generated

Presenting Form I-9 Documents 

Within 3 business days of starting work for pay, you must present to your employer documentation that establishes your 
identity and employment authorization. For example, if you begin employment on Monday, you must present documentation 
on or before Thursday of that week. However, if you were hired to work for less than 3 business days, you must present 
documentation no later than the first day of employment. 

Choose which unexpired document(s) to present to your employer from the Lists of Acceptable Documents. An employer 
cannot specify which document(s) you may present from the Lists of Acceptable Documents. You may present either one 
selection from List A or a combination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C. Some List A documents, 
which show both identity and employment authorization, are combination documents that must be presented together to be 
considered a List A document: for example, the foreign passport together with a Form I-94 containing an endorsement of the 
alien’s nonimmigrant status and employment authorization with a specific employer incident to such status. List B documents 
show identity only and List C documents show employment authorization only. If your employer participates in E-Verify and 
you present a List B document, the document must contain a photograph. If you present acceptable List A documentation, you 
should not be asked to present, nor should you provide, List B and List C documentation. If you present acceptable List B and 
List C documentation, you should not be asked to present, nor should you provide, List A documentation. If you are unable to 
present a document(s) from these lists, you may be able to present an acceptable receipt. Refer to the Receipts section below. 

Your employer must review the document(s) you present to complete Form I-9. If your document(s) reasonably appears to be 
genuine and to relate to you, your employer must accept the documents. If your document(s) does not reasonably appear to be 
genuine or to relate to you, your employer must reject it and provide you with an opportunity to present other documents from 
the Lists of Acceptable Documents. Your employer may choose to make copies of your document(s), but must return the 
original(s) to you. Your employer must review your documents in your physical presence. 

Form I-9 Instructions 10/21/2019 

 

Page 5 of 15 

Your employer will complete the other parts of this form, as well as review your entries in Section 1. Your employer may ask 
you to correct any errors found. Your employer is responsible for ensuring all parts of Form I-9 are properly completed and is 
subject to penalties under federal law if the form is not completed correctly. 

Minors (individuals under age 18) and certain employees with disabilities whose parent, legal guardian or representative 
completed Section 1 for the employee are only required to present an employment authorization document from List C. Refer to 
the Handbook for Employers: Guidance for Completing Form I-9 (M-274) for more guidance on minors and certain individuals 
with disabilities. 

Receipts 

If you do not have unexpired documentation from the Lists of Acceptable Documents, you may be able to present a receipt(s) in 
lieu of an acceptable document(s). New employees who choose to present a receipt(s) must do so within three business days of 
their first day of employment. If your employer is reverifying your employment authorization, and you choose to present a 
receipt for reverification, you must present the receipt by the date your employment authorization expires. Receipts are not 
acceptable if employment lasts fewer than three business days. 

There are three types of acceptable receipts: 
1.  A receipt showing that you have applied to replace a document that was lost, stolen or damaged. You must present the 

actual document within 90 days from the date of hire or, in the case of reverification, within 90 days from the date your 
original employment authorization expires. 

2.  The arrival portion of Form I-94/I-94A containing a temporary I-551 stamp and a photograph of the individual. You must 

present the actual Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551) by the expiration date of the temporary I-551 stamp, or, if there is 
no expiration date, within 1 year from the date of admission. 

3.  The departure portion of Form I-94/I-94A with a refugee admission stamp. You must present an unexpired Employment 
Authorization Document (Form I-766) or a combination of a List B document and an unrestricted Social Security Card 
within 90 days from the date of hire or, in the case of reverification, within 90 days from the date your original employment 
authorization expires. 

Receipts showing that you have applied for an initial grant of employment authorization, or for renewal of your expiring or 
expired employment authorization, are not acceptable. 

Completing Section 2: Employer or Authorized Representative Review and Verification 

You, the employer, must ensure that all parts of Form I-9 are properly completed and may be subject to penalties under federal 
law if the form is not completed correctly. Section 1 must be completed no later than the employee’s first day of employment. 
You may not ask an individual to complete Section 1 before he or she has accepted a job offer. Before completing Section 2, 
you should review Section 1 to ensure the employee completed it properly. If you find any errors in Section 1, have the 
employee make corrections, as necessary and initial and date any corrections made. 

You may designate an authorized representative to act on your behalf to complete Section 2. An authorized representative can 
be any person you designate to complete and sign Form I-9 on your behalf. You are liable for any violations in connection with 
the form or the verification process, including any violations of the employer sanctions laws committed by the person 
designated to act on your behalf. 

You or your authorized representative must complete Section 2 by examining evidence of identity and employment 
authorization within 3 business days of the employee’s first day of employment. For example, if an employee begins 
employment on Monday, you must review the employee's documentation and complete Section 2 on or before Thursday of that 
week. However, if you hire an individual for less than 3 business days, Section 2 must be completed no later than the first day 
of employment. 

 

 

Entering Employee Information from Section 1 

This area, titled, “Employee Info from Section 1” contains fields to enter the employee's last name, first name, middle initial 
exactly as he or she entered them in Section 1. This area also includes a Citizenship/Immigration Status field to enter the 
number of the citizenship or immigration status checkbox the employee selected in Section 1. These fields help to ensure that 
the two pages of an employee's Form I-9 remain together. When completing Section 2 using a computer, the number entered in

Entering Documents the Employee Presents 

You, the employer or authorized representative, must physically examine, in the employee's physical presence, the unexpired 
document(s) the employee presents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents to complete the Document fields in Section 2. 

You cannot specify which document(s) an employee may present from these lists. If you discriminate in the Form I-9 process 
based on an individual's citizenship status, immigration status, or national origin, you may be in violation of the law and subject 
to sanctions such as civil penalties and be required to pay back pay to discrimination victims. A document is acceptable as long 
as it reasonably appears to be genuine and to relate to the person presenting it. Employees must present one selection from List 
A or a combination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C. 

List A documents show both identity and employment authorization. Some List A documents are combination documents that 
must be presented together to be considered a List A document, such as a foreign passport together with a Form I-94 containing 
an endorsement of the alien’s nonimmigrant status. 

List B documents show identity only, and List C documents show employment authorization only. If an employee presents a List 
A document, do not ask or require the employee to present List B and List C documents, and vice versa. If an employer 
participates in E-Verify and the employee presents a List B document, the List B document must include a photograph. 

If an employee presents a receipt for the application to replace a lost, stolen or damaged document, the employee must present 
the replacement document to you within 90 days of the first day of work for pay, or in the case of reverification, within 90 days 
of the date the employee's employment authorization expired. Enter the word “Receipt” followed by the title of the receipt in 
Section 2 under the list that relates to the receipt. 

When your employee presents the replacement document, draw a line through the receipt, then enter the information from the 
new document into Section 2. Other receipts may be valid for longer or shorter periods, such as the arrival portion of Form I-94/ 
I-94A containing a temporary I-551 stamp and a photograph of the individual, which is valid until the expiration date of the 
temporary I-551 stamp or, if there is no expiration date, valid for one year from the date of admission. 

Ensure that each document is an unexpired, original (no photocopies, except for certified copies of birth certificates) document. 
Certain employees may present an expired employment authorization document, which may be considered unexpired, if the 
employee's employment authorization has been extended by regulation or a Federal Register Notice. Refer to the Handbook for 
Employers: Guidance for Completing Form I-9 (M-274) or I-9 Central for more guidance on these special situations. 

Refer to the M-274 for guidance on how to handle special situations, such as students (who may present additional documents 
not specified on the Lists) and H-1B and H-2A nonimmigrants changing employers. 

Minors (individuals under age 18) and certain employees with disabilities whose parent, legal guardian or representative 
completed Section 1 for the employee are only required to present an employment authorization document from List C. Refer to 
the M-274 for more guidance on minors and certain persons with disabilities. If the minor's employer participates in E-Verify, 
the minor employee also must present a List B identity document with a photograph to complete Form I-9. 

You must return original document(s) to the employee, but may make photocopies of the document(s) reviewed. Photocopying 
documents is voluntary unless you participate in E-Verify. E-Verify employers are only required to photocopy certain 
documents. If you are an E-Verify employer who chooses to photocopy documents other than those you are required to 
photocopy, you should apply this policy consistently with respect to Form I-9 completion for all employees. For more 
information on the types of documents that an employer must photocopy if the employer uses E-Verify, visit E-Verify’s website 
at www.everify.gov. For non-E-Verify employers, if photocopies are made, they should be made consistently for ALL new 
hires and reverified employees. 

Photocopies must be retained and presented with Form I-9 in case of an inspection by DHS or another federal government 
agency. You must always complete Section 2 by reviewing original documentation, even if you photocopy an employee’s 
document(s) after reviewing the documentation. Making photocopies of an employee’s document(s) cannot take the place of 
completing Form I-9. You are still responsible for completing and retaining Form I-9.

Completing Section 3: Reverification and Rehires 

Section 3 applies to both reverification and rehires. When completing this section, you must also complete the Last Name, First 
Name and Middle Initial fields in the Employee Info from Section 1 area at the top of Section 2, leaving the Citizenship/ 
Immigration Status field blank. When completing Section 3 in either a reverification or rehire situation, if the employee’s name 
has changed, record the new name in Block A. 

Reverification 

Reverification in Section 3 must be completed prior to the earlier of: 

  The expiration date, if any, of the employment authorization stated in Section 1, or 
  The expiration date, if any, of the List A or List C employment authorization document recorded in Section 2 

(with some exceptions listed below). 

Some employees may have entered “N/A” in the expiration date field in Section 1 if they are aliens whose employment 
authorization does not expire, e.g. asylees, refugees, certain citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands, or Palau. Reverification does not apply for such employees unless they choose to present evidence of 
employment authorization in Section 2 that contains an expiration date and requires reverification, such as Form I-766, 
Employment Authorization Document. 

You should not reverify U.S. citizens and noncitizen nationals, or lawful permanent residents (including conditional residents) 
who presented a Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551). Reverification does not apply to List B documents. 

Form I-9 Instructions 10/21/2019 

 

Page 12 of 15 

For reverification, an employee must present an unexpired document(s) (or a receipt) from either List A or List C showing he or 
she is still authorized to work. You CANNOT require the employee to present a particular document from List A or List C. The 
employee is also not required to show the same type of document that he or she presented previously. See specific instructions 
on how to complete Section 3 below. 

Rehires 

If you rehire an employee within three years from the date that the Form I-9 was previously executed, you may either rely on 
the employee’s previously executed Form I-9 or complete a new Form I-9. 

If you choose to rely on a previously completed Form I-9, follow these guidelines. 

  If the employee remains employment authorized as indicated on the previously executed Form I-9, the employee does 

not need to provide any additional documentation. Provide in Section 3 the employee’s rehire date, any name changes if 
applicable, and sign and date the form. 

  If the previously executed Form I-9 indicates that the employee’s employment authorization from Section 1 or 
employment authorization documentation from Section 2 that is subject to reverification has expired, then 
reverification of employment authorization is required in Section 3 in addition to providing the rehire date. If the 
previously executed Form I-9 is not the current version of the form, you must complete Section 3 on the current 
version of the form. 

  If you already used Section 3 of the employee’s previously executed Form I-9, but are rehiring the employee within 
three years of the original execution of Form I-9, you may complete Section 3 on a new Form I-9 and attach it to the 
previously executed form. 

Employees rehired after three years of original execution of the Form I-9 must complete a new Form I-9. 

Complete each block in Section 3 as follows: 

Block A - New Name: If an employee who is being reverified or rehired has also changed his or her name since originally 
completing Section 1 of this form, complete this block with the employee’s new name. Enter only the part of the name that has 
changed, for example: if the employee changed only his or her last name, enter the last name in the Last Name field in this 
Block, then enter N/A in the First Name and Middle Initial fields. If the employee has not changed his or her name, enter N/A in 
each field of Block A. 

Block B - Date of Rehire: Complete this block if you are rehiring an employee within three years of the date Form I-9 was 
originally executed. Enter the date of rehire in this field. Enter N/A in this field if the employee is not being rehired. 

Block C - Complete this block if you are reverifying expiring or expired employment authorization or employment 
authorization documentation of a current or rehired employee. Enter the information from the List A or List C document(s) (or 
receipt) that the employee presented to reverify his or her employment authorization. All documents must be unexpired. 

Document Title: Enter the title of the List A or C document (or receipt) the employee has presented to show continuing 
employment authorization in this field. 

Document Number: Enter the document number, if any, of the document you entered in the Document Title field

verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: when you open an account, we 
will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s 
license or other identifying documents.

MEMORANDUM

ALL  NEW EMPLOYEES 

FROM: 

Administrative  Office of the Courts & Probation 

RE: 

Participation in State Retirement 

In 2006 the Nebraska Legislature passed a bill that mandated that all full-time 
permanent employees participate in the State Employees' Retirement Plan effective the 
first day of their employment.  For the purposes of retirement contributions, the 
Retirement Office considers any permanent employee who works 20 hours or more per 
week, to be full-time.

All new plan members participate in the mandatory Cash Balance Plan.

The employee's contribution rate is a mandatory 4.8% of their pre-tax gross pay.  The 
State matches that contribution by 156%.  After 3 years of contributions an employee is 
considered to be 100% vested.

Attached is a Welcome from the Nebraska Public Employee Retirement Systems, a 
Beneficiary Designation Form (which must be notarized) and an Application for Vesting 
Credit/Prior Service Credit Form.  Both original forms need to be returned to the  
Administrative Office of the Courts/Probation Human Resources.

The Basics

State Retirement Plan
All new plan members participate in the  
mandatory Cash Balance benefit immedi-
ately upon employment. 
Participation is voluntary for permanent, part-
time employees age 18 or older and perma-
nent part-time seasonal employees age 18 or 
older. To enroll, employees must submit a Cash 
Balance Voluntary Enrollment Form to NPERS 
within their first 30 days of employment.
 Members contribute 4.8% of salary pre-tax 

and the state matches contributions at 156%.

 Members are “vested” after three years.

 Member accounts receive an “interest credit 
rate” (rate of return) based on the federal 
mid-term rate plus 1.5% and are guaranteed a 
minimum annual rate of return of 5%.

 Members may choose to retire at age 55.

 Members have multiple payment options of 

their account at retirement.

 For more information, please refer to the plan 

handbook.

Deferred Compensation 
Plan (DCP)
All State of Nebraska employees may partici-
pate in this tax-sheltered, voluntary retirement 
plan, even if employed on a temporary or 
part-time basis. 
 Participants may set and change contribution 
amounts, or cease and resume contributions. 

 The minimum contribution is $25 per month.

 Taxes on the contributions and earnings are 

deferred until disbursement.

 Plan participants choose their own invest-

ments from multiple funds.

 This is a long-term retirement plan, not a short-
term savings plan. Members cannot remove 
funds until they cease employment.

 For more information, please refer to the plan 

handbook and the Annual Investment Report.

WORKPLACE HARASSMENT POLICY 

It is the policy of the Nebraska Court System that all its officers, employees, and the 

recipients of its services be treated fairly and equally, with dignity and respect. 

Accordingly, any court system  officer  or employee who,  while  on  court  system or 

related  premises, engages  in sexual  harassment  or  in any  manner  utters, circulates,  or 
publishes  any  inflammatory  comment, joke,  or  innuendo  based in whole or in part on 
race, color,  religion, gender,  age,  disability,  or  national origin, when  such 

(1) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive
working environment, or

(2) interferes unreasonably with one's work or employment opportunities or with
the receipt of services, shall be deemed to have engaged in workplace
harassment and shall be subject to appropriate discipline.

Any officer or supervisor who knowingly permits an employee to engage in such 

harassment shall also be subject to appropriate discipline. 

For the purpose of this policy, "sexual harassment" shall be defined as any 

unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors, and either verbal or physical 
conduct of a sexual nature when: 

(1) submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term of an
individual's employment or a condition of an individual’s receipt of court services,
or

(2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis
for employment or court system decisions affecting an employee or recipient of
the court system services; or

(3) such conduct, whether welcome or unwelcome, has the purpose or effect of
unreasonably interfering with an employee's work performance or with an
individual's receipt of court services, or of creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive environment.

Any officer or employee who believes that he or she has been the subject of 

workplace harassment is encouraged to report the alleged incident immediately to the 
Administrative Office which shall process complaints in a timely and confidential 
manner.  Supervisors should contact the Administrative Office whenever they have 
information regarding a possible violation of this policy. Complainants and other 
persons involved in an investigation of an allegation of workplace harassment shall not 
be  subjected to retaliation, coercion, intimidation or reprisal.

1. Furlough Policy *

(* Note: See explanation under Other Related Policies.) 

   Furlough is involuntary leave without pay for a preset number of hours during one or more pay 
periods. No paid leave times shall be taken by an employee during a furlough. 

   If the Supreme Court deems it necessary to deviate from the standard workday or standard 
workweek due to shortage of funds, the Administrative Office shall submit a proposed furlough 
plan to the Supreme Court. 

   The furlough plan to be submitted to the Supreme Court shall specify: 

1. The purpose of the furlough.

2. The job classifications, specific offices, funding sources, or any combination thereof affected
by the proposed plan.

3. The criteria used to select the classification, specific offices, funding sources, or any
combination thereof included in the furlough.

4. The approximate duration of the proposed furlough.

5. The preset number of hours during one or more pay periods that will be reduced.

6. The estimated cost savings generated by the proposed furlough.

7. Any other information requested by the Supreme Court.

After approval by the Supreme Court of a furlough plan, the Administrative Office shall notify
appropriate supervisors of the affected offices. The supervisor shall notify employees affected by 
the furlough plan. 

    An employee's accrual of vacation and sick leave will continue during furlough periods at 
otherwise authorized rates notwithstanding other rules to the contrary. Social Security and 
retirement contributions shall be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the employee's gross 
pay. Such furloughs shall not affect an employee's health insurance, continuous service, length of 
service, or eligibility for authorized holiday compensation or longevity increases. 

    A furlough shall not be used as a disciplinary action against an employee. 

Adopted 3-12-03 

2. Use of Social Media *

(* Note: See explanation under Other Related Policies.) 

   The purpose of this policy is not to restrict the flow of useful and appropriate information, but 
to minimize the risk to the Nebraska Supreme Court and its employees. The Nebraska Supreme 
Court recognizes the growing importance of online social media networks as a communication 
tool and respects the right of employees to use these mediums during their personal time. Use of 
these mediums during working hours or on work equipment, however, should be kept to a 
minimum and shall not interfere with the conduct of state business. 

   The Nebraska Supreme Court takes no position on employees' decision to participate in the use 
of social media networks. However, employees who participate in social media may include 
information about their work with the Nebraska Supreme Court as part of their personal profile, 
as it would relate to a typical social conversation. This may include: 

· Work information such as work location, job title, and job duties.

· Status updates regarding an employee's own job promotion.

· Personal participation in court activities and sponsored events, including volunteer activities.

In general, employees who participate in social media are free to publish their own personal

information without censorship by the Nebraska Supreme Court. 

   All employees are responsible for maintaining the Nebraska Supreme Court's positive 
reputation and presenting the Court in a manner that safeguards the positive reputation of 
themselves, as well as other employees and judges. 

   If an employee chooses to identify himself or herself as a court/probation employee on any 
social media network, he or she must state in clear terms that the views expressed are the 
employee's alone and that they do not reflect the views of the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
Employees are prohibited from acting as a spokesperson for the Nebraska Supreme Court or 
posting comments as a representative of the Court. 

   There are some types of information employees are not permitted to discuss or display online, 
including: 

· Information that is confidential or proprietary to the Nebraska Supreme Court, or to a third
party that has disclosed information to the Court. For example: information about or identifying
coworkers, judges, court cases, or parties in a case.

· Statements disparaging the Nebraska Supreme Court, judges, attorneys, or coworkers.

· Nebraska Supreme Court's seal on any social media network. Also, images of coworkers,
judges, and court or office premises and property.

· Statements, comments, or images referencing illegal drugs or that include profanity or could be
considered obscene.

· Statements, comments, or images that disparage any race, religion, gender, sexual orientation,
disability, or national origin. Also, any communication that engages in personal or sexual
harassment, unfounded accusations, or remarks that would contribute to a hostile work
environment (racial, sexual, religious, etc.), as well as any behavior not in agreement with any
Nebraska Supreme Court codes of conduct or personnel policies.

   The nature of any social media posting and degree of harm to the Nebraska Supreme Court will 
be factors in determining whether discipline will be imposed and the severity of any such 
discipline, up to and including termination of employment. 

Adopted 05-23-12 

3. Workplace Harassment Policy *

(* Note: See explanation under Other Related Policies.) 

   It is the policy of the Nebraska Court System that all its officers, employees, and the recipients 
of its services be treated fairly and equally, with dignity and respect. 

   Accordingly, any court system officer or employee who, while on court system or related 
premises, engages in sexual harassment or in any manner utters, circulates, or publishes any 
inflammatory comment, joke, or innuendo based in whole or in part on race, color, religion, 
gender, age, disability, or national origin, when such 

(1) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working
environment, or

(2) interferes unreasonably with one's work or employment opportunities or with the receipt of
services, shall be deemed to have engaged in workplace harassment and shall be subject to
appropriate discipline.

   Any officer or supervisor who knowingly permits an employee to engage in such harassment 
shall also be subject to appropriate discipline. 

   For the purpose of this policy, "sexual harassment" shall be defined as any unwelcome sexual 
advance, request for sexual favors, and either verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 

(1) submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term of an individual's
employment or a condition of an individual's receipt of court services, or

(2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
employment or court system decisions affecting an employee or recipient of the court system
services; or

(3) such conduct, whether welcome or unwelcome, has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an employee's work performance or with an individual's receipt of court
services, or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.

   Any officer or employee who believes that he or she has been the subject of workplace 
harassment is encouraged to report the alleged incident immediately to the Administrative Office 
which shall process complaints in a timely and confidential manner.  Supervisors should contact 
the Administrative Office whenever they have information regarding a possible violation of this 
policy. Complainants and other persons involved in an investigation of an allegation of 
workplace harassment shall not be subjected to retaliation, coercion, intimidation or reprisal. 

Amended 9-27-05; amended 7-9-15 

4. Drug-Free Workplace Policy *

(* Note: See explanation under Other Related Policies.) 

   Drug abuse and use at the workplace are subjects of immediate concern in our society. These 
problems are extremely complex and ones for which there are no easy solutions.  From a safety 
perspective, the use of drugs may impair the well-being of officers, employees, and the public at 
large, and may result in damage to court property. Therefore, it is the policy of the Nebraska 
Court System that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a 
controlled substance in the workplace is prohibited.  Any officer or employee violating this 
policy will be subject to discipline up to and including termination. The specifics of this policy 
are as follows: 

1. The Nebraska Court System does not differentiate between drug users and drug pushers or
sellers.  Any officer or employee who gives or in any way transfers a controlled substance to
another person, sells or manufactures a controlled substance, or violates any drug law while on
the job or on court premises will be  reported to the appropriate prosecuting authority and,
whether convicted or not, will be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

2. The term "controlled substance" refers to any drug listed in 21 U.S.C. § 812 or a drug,
substance, or immediate precursor listed in Schedules I to V of § 28-405 of the Nebraska
Revised Statutes.  Also included in the term are unauthorized prescription drugs.

3. Each officer and employee is required by law to inform the State Court Administrator or State
Probation Administrator within 5 days after he or she is convicted of violating any federal or
state criminal drug statute, where such violation occurred on the court system's premises.  A
conviction means a finding of guilt by a judge or jury in any federal or state court.

4. The Administrative Office will notify the U.S. government agency with which a contract has
been made within 10 days after receiving notice from an employee or a judge or otherwise
receiving actual notice of such a conviction.

5. If an officer or employee is convicted of violating any criminal drug statute while at the
workplace, he or she will be subject to discipline up to and including termination.  Alternatively,
the Nebraska Court System may require the officer or employee to successfully finish a drug
abuse program sponsored by an approved private or governmental institution.

   As a condition of further employment on any federal government contract, the law requires all 
officers and employees to abide by this policy. 

5. Travel Policies *

(* Note: See explanation under Other Related Policies.) 

A. Travel Reimbursements

   Reimbursements will be made only for travel expenses essential to the transaction of official 
business and all expenses claimed should reflect only those amounts actually expended.  Expense 
vouchers should be fully itemized, including when, where, and why the travel expenses were 
incurred with expenditures listed by the day the expenses were incurred.  Expense vouchers must 
be submitted at least on a monthly basis to the Administrative Office of the Courts/Probation. 
Expense voucher forms are available online at: http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/forms/supreme-
court-travel-report.shtml. If the reimbursement is for an expense related to education, the 
voucher should be submitted directly to the Judicial Branch Education Director. 

B. Approval for Travel

   Before an officer or employee attends a function, conference, or meeting requiring travel, 
approval should be obtained from the State Court Administrator, State Probation Administrator, 
or Judicial Branch Education Director. This does not include normal day-to-day travel required 
for regular job responsibilities or activities required or sponsored by the Administrative Office of 
the Courts/Probation including Judicial Branch Education. However, a judge exercising his or 
her authority to request assistance from another judge to cover cases on a temporary basis, shall 
request approval from the Administrative Office of the Courts only if the replacement judge must 
travel more than 60 miles (one way) to perform those duties. In all cases, prior approval must be 
obtained if the travel method chosen is not the most economical method of transportation. 

   Every effort shall be made to submit requests for approval for travel not later than 30 days 
prior to the event. 

C. Mode of Travel
Air Travel 

   Air travel shall only be authorized by the State Court Administrator, State Probation 
Administrator, or Judicial Branch Education Director when it is more economical than surface 
transportation or will result in a substantial savings of expense or productive 
time.  Reimbursement for commercial air travel will be limited to "coach" fare if such seating is 
available at the time of ticket purchase.  Travel by privately-owned, state-owned, or personally 
rented airplanes must have the prior approval of the State Court Administrator, State Probation 
Administrator, or Judicial Branch Education Director.  Employees and officers should coordinate 
with the State Court Administrator, State Probation Administrator, or Judicial Branch Education 
Director in booking air travel. The submission of a receipt showing booking terms is required for 
reimbursement. 

Personal Automobiles 

   An employee will be reimbursed for use of a personal vehicle while on work-related business 
(this does not include commuting miles). When reimbursement is claimed for mileage by 
personal automobile, the points between which said mileage occurred, the times of arrival and 
departure, and the necessity and purpose of such travel should be shown on such claim.  The 
license number, the employee's NIS number (the NIS number is shown on paycheck stub 
information available online), the owner of the automobile used, and the rate per mile being 
claimed should also be shown.  Total mileage will be reimbursed at the current mileage rate per 
mile per vehicle as determined by the Nebraska Supreme Court regardless of the fact that one or 
more persons may have been transported in the same vehicle.  Funds expended for parking may 
be claimed in addition to mileage. 

   If an officer or employee chooses to use his or her personal automobile in lieu of air travel 
even though air travel is a more economical method of transportation, the officer or employee 
will be reimbursed only the amount equal to the cost of the airfare.  Other expenses such as 
lodging and meals that may be incurred because of traveling by personal automobile will not be 
reimbursed. 

   It is recommended that if a state vehicle is available, it be used in lieu of a personal vehicle 
when traveling in excess of 50 miles.

 State Vehicles 

   No reimbursement for mileage will be allowed when such mileage accrues while using an 
automobile owned by the State of Nebraska. 

   Permanent state vehicle assignment will be considered when a vehicle is required for a period 
of 30 days or longer, will travel a minimum of 1,000 miles, and will be utilized 17 working days 
monthly. 

   Requests for permanently assigned vehicles should be submitted to the Administrative Office 
of the Courts/Probation at least 20 working days in advance of the required date. Requests should 
include the date the vehicle is desired; the type of vehicle desired, i.e., compact, intermediate, or 
regular sedan, et cetera; the estimated monthly mileage; the name of the principal driver; and the 
office location. 

   Personal use of any state-owned vehicle is prohibited by statute and is a Class V 
misdemeanor.  See Neb. Rev. Stat. §81-1024 (Reissue 1999). 

   Whenever a state vehicle is permanently assigned to an officer or employee of the court, 
additional policies regarding the use of a state vehicle should be requested from the 
Administrative Office of the Courts/Probation. 

   Officers and employees are encouraged to carpool for travel to events, and the Administrative 
Office of the Courts/Probation reserves the right to require carpooling with state vehicles for 
specified functions. 

D. Commuting

   Commuting expenses are defined by the Internal Revenue Service as those expenses incurred 
in traveling from one's residence to one's place of work and return to residence no matter how 
often this occurs during a day.  These expenses are considered personal expenses and are not 
considered reimbursable expenses. When using a state car for commuting, IRS rules require that 
$1.50 each way be added to the employee's income reported on a W-2. 

E. Conference / Meeting Expenses

   The approval to attend a conference, workshop, or meeting that is not considered a normal job 
responsibility, or that is not sponsored by the Administrative Office of the Courts/Probation 
including Judicial Branch Education, shall be obtained from the State Court Administrator, State 
Probation Administrator or Judicial Branch Education Director prior to the individual's 
attendance at such function. If funding is being requested for an education event that is not 
sponsored by Judicial Branch Education, prior approval shall be requested by using the forms 
prescribed by the Judicial Branch Education Director. The forms are available at: 
https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/HR-2-15.pdf for the courts and 
https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/HR-2-12.pdf for probation.   

   Only conference/meeting expenses incurred on the days necessary to travel to and from the 
conference/meeting and those incurred on the actual days of the conference/meeting may be 
reimbursed.  Prior approval from the State Court Administrator, State Probation Administrator, 
or Judicial Branch Education Director must be obtained for reimbursement of expenses that 
result from arriving early or result from extending departure.  The following includes additional 
specific limitations in expense reimbursements. 

(1) Meals

   Only actual amounts paid for meals may be claimed.  The Internal Revenue Service 
requires employees to substantiate the cost of meals under an accountable plan. The 
Administrative Office of the Courts/Probation requires all officers and employees to keep 
itemized receipts (not credit card receipts) for meal expenses.  Transfer the receipt 
information to the expense voucher and attach the receipts to the expense voucher to 
satisfy the IRS requirement for an accountable plan. Unsubstantiated meal expenses will 
not be reimbursed.  Again, the amounts claimed should be actual meal costs.  Tips are a 
reimbursable expense.  No reimbursement may be made for alcoholic beverages. 

   There are time limitations on reimbursements for meals.  The time limitations do not 
include the time taken for the meal.  If departure is before 6:30 a.m. or 1½ hours before 
the officer or employee begins work, whichever is earlier, breakfast may be 
reimbursed.  Noon meals may be reimbursed if departure is at or before 11 a.m. (for 
overnight travel) or the return time is at or after 2 p.m. (from overnight travel).  Noon 
meals for 1-day travel are not reimbursable.  If the return time is after 7 p.m. or 2 hours 
after the officer's or employee's workday ends, whichever is later, the evening meal may 
be reimbursed. Meal expenses incurred in the city or town in which the residence or 
primary work location of such employee or officer is located are not reimbursable. 
Reimbursement for meal expenses incurred on 1-day travel is taxable income to the 
officer or employee if the expenses are $200 or more in any one year--December 1 
through November 30.  The total amount is taxable income. 

   Reimbursements for meals will not exceed the U.S. General Services Administration 
(GSA) limit on meals. Meal allowances include tips. Guidelines for meal allowances can 
be found on the following Web site: www.gsa.gov. Employees or officers will not be 
reimbursed for any meal that was provided as part of an event or function should they 
choose to eat elsewhere absent good cause shown. 

Amended December 11, 2013. 

(2) Lodging

   Lodging may be reimbursed if the attendance of a meeting or conference requires an 
officer or employee to be away from the general area of his or her normal work location 
for a period substantially longer than an ordinary day's work. The absence must be of 
such duration that the officer or employee cannot reasonably leave and return to that 
location before and after each day's work. 

   Generally, a person must be 50 miles or more from his or her workplace in order to be 
eligible for lodging reimbursement. Under special circumstances and with prior approval, 
lodging may be approved for distances less than 50 miles. A written request for such 
approval should be directed to either the State Court Administrator, State Probation 
Administrator or if the event is a Judicial Branch Education event, the Judicial Branch 
Education Director. 

   Receipts for lodging on motel/hotel letterhead are required for reimbursement (not the 
charge card receipt). Only actual expenses for lodging are reimbursable, and prior 
approval is generally required. No movie charges or alcohol charges are allowed. At the 
time a request is made to attend the conference/meeting, individuals should request that 
the State Court Administrator, State Probation Administrator, or the Judicial Branch 
Education Director try to arrange for direct billing. 

   The state rate for lodging should always be requested. In no event should the federal 
GSA per person per night rate be exceeded without advance approval. Any deviation 
from the federal per diem rates (GSA per diem rates: www.gsa.gov/perdiem) must be 
accompanied by documentation justifying the need for such deviation. If an officer or 
employee shares a room with an individual other than an officer or employee, only the 
single rate will be reimbursed.  The difference must be paid when checking out. The 
motel/hotel should note the single rate on the bill.  If a room is shared by two or more 
officers or employees, the name(s) should be noted on the bill. 

   It is the responsibility of an employee or officer to honor hotel/motel checkout times. If 
a late checkout results in a charge for that day, payment of that charge will be the 
responsibility of the officer or employee. 

   Often for meetings and conferences sponsored by the Supreme Court, lodging expenses 
will be direct billed. Billing should always be checked before leaving the hotel/motel. If 

lodging is direct billed, individuals must pay additional costs, i.e., telephone calls, which 
may be indicated on the billing. Personal phone calls are not reimbursable. 

   If lodging is with friends or relatives, there are no reimbursable lodging expenses. 

(3) Other Expenses

   Registration fees for programs not funded by the Supreme Court are reimbursable if 
prior approval has been granted.  The original receipt or canceled check should be 
included with the claim. 

   Parking expenses, tips, tolls, and baggage handling expenses are reimbursable.  No 
receipts are necessary unless the expenses are unusually high. 

   Other ground travel expense (cab, shuttle bus, intra-city bus, et cetera) is 
reimbursable.  No receipts are necessary unless the expense is unusually high. 

   Note: If an officer or employee of the Court registers for a conference or workshop and 
then fails to attend without canceling in adequate time, all expenses (i.e. registration fee, 
lodging, prescheduled meals, et cetera) will be the responsibility of the officer or 
employee of the court except under extraordinary circumstances. 

F. Expense Reimbursement Document
(Expense Voucher)

   Expense vouchers should be submitted at least once a month but may be submitted more often 
if desired. Expense voucher forms are available online at: 
https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/HR-2-05.pdf. All expenses should be listed 
for conferences separately from other monthly travel expenses.  Employees and officers must 
include their NIS number on the expense voucher.  The NIS number is shown on paycheck stub 
information available online. 

   Expenses should be itemized so that the nature, purpose, and necessity of each item are 
apparent.  Expense vouchers should include the time and place of departure and the time of 
return to the headquarter city in each instance.  All items claimed for reimbursement for any one 
trip should be included on the same expense voucher. 

   One officer or employee may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred on behalf of another 
officer or employee, such as when two employees sharing a motel room are billed jointly and 
one officer or employee pays the bill.  The officer or employee to be reimbursed should provide 
the same detailed information on the expense voucher that would have been required if each 
officer or employee had been billed individually.  In all cases, when one officer or employee is 
requesting reimbursement for expenses of more than one officer or employee, original receipts 

should be provided, and the officers or employees' names listed and documents cross-referenced, 
when applicable.  If two officers or employees are billed jointly, but each pays half and each 
requests reimbursement separately, the documents should be cross-referenced, since one officer 
or employee usually will not have an original receipt. 

   Expenses will be paid for officers and employees of the courts and probation only.  In cases in 
which a spouse or other individual accompanies the officer or employee on official business, 
only the expenses of the officer or employee will be paid.  In such cases, lodging and other 
receipts should indicate the appropriate single person charge. 

   Original signatures on all expense vouchers are required from both the officer or employee and 
appropriate supervisor (Division Approval).  No stamped signatures will be accepted. 

Information Systems and Security Policy

(Approved November 22, 2017; replaces the Acceptable Use Policy for Computer and Internet 
Use and the Electronic Communications Equipment Policy.)

   The purpose of the Information Systems and Security Policy is to protect the judicial 
branch's information technology (IT) resources and to allow for current and future oversight of 
IT resources, restricting access as needed for security while still promoting the daily ability to 
conduct business and provide services.

I. Intent:

II. Applicability:

   This Information Systems and Security Policy shall apply to all judicial officers and 
employees of the Nebraska Supreme Court (NSC). Where indicated, this policy shall also 
apply to contract workers and internship positions. Any judicial officer, employee, intern or 
contractor (end user) of the judicial branch is also governed by NITC (Nebraska Information 
Technology Commission) standards, when not in conflict with internal judicial branch policies.

III. Acceptable Use:

   Use of judicial branch equipment and networks shall be prioritized for professional 
communications and handling of work-related business. Employees can use the equipment 
for personal use "within reasonable limits," which means it cannot result in loss of work 
productivity, interfere with official duties or result in additional expense. End users should not 
have any expectations of privacy regarding personal business conducted on equipment or 
networks provided through the judicial branch unless protected by state or federal law. All use 
is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations, such as public record laws of 
the State of Nebraska as well as Supreme Court rules. Routine monitoring of individual end 
users will not occur however NSC-IT will perform some routine monitoring of overall use of 
equipment or networks. In the event of reported or suspected violation of this policy, the State 
Court Administrator, the State Probation Administrator, or their designee may authorize 
monitoring of usage by a person subject to this policy, including Internet access and e-mail 
transmission, to be conducted by State of Nebraska Office of the Chief Information Officer 
(OCIO) or an applicable service provider. Unacceptable uses of judicial branch equipment and 
networks include, but are not limited to, violation of the privacy of other users and their data; 
malicious or disruptive use; unsolicited advertising, fund-raising or other for-profit activities; 

misrepresentation of the judicial branch; and use of unauthorized software or hardware in 
violation of license agreements. See also: NITC 7-101: Acceptable Use Policy State Data 
Communication Network.

IV. Access Control:

a. Physical Access

i. The data center shall only be accessible by the Network Administrator. If a contract worker

or anyone else needs to access NSC's servers in the data center the Network Administrator 
must accompany them. Physical access to the data center shall be granted by smart card 
credentials and fingerprint scanning of the Network Administrator by the OCIO and building 
security.

ii. Access to the storage vault(s) used for equipment storage by the NSC-IT (Nebraska
Supreme Court Information Technology) Department in the basement of the state Capitol 
shall be controlled by the Court Administrator's office. The employee (employee, intern or 
contractor) must have smart card access to the basement of the Capitol and a vault key, or be 
accompanied by an authorized employee.

iii. Access to the NSC-IT work areas will be secured to ensure the protection of stored
computer assets, as well as preventing unauthorized access to any IT workstations and 
equipment.

iv. NSC-IT will have a smart card and / or key access to all employee work areas before,
during and after work hours for emergency IT purposes. NSC-IT will schedule visits ahead of 
time wherever possible.

v. Devices are available for checkout that allow end users to utilize hardware or software

needed to do their job while away from their office. NSC-IT will manage access to and security 
for these devices. End users are responsible for safekeeping during the period in which they 
are checked out.

vi. Use of removable media shall be limited to purposes of direct support of work-related

functions where other means of secure data transfer are not available. Only removable media 
issued by NSC-IT shall be used on judicial branch owned or leased equipment. NSC-IT will be 
responsible for scanning and securing removable media when not in use.

b. User Access

i. The Network Administrator and or NSC-IT is responsible for creating user accounts and
accompanying passwords, active directory (AD) structures for different departments and the 
needed group policies (GPO) to accompany them within the NSCAP (Nebraska Supreme 
Court Administration and Probation) domain. The state OCIO is responsible for exchange 
services and all other services and applications it provides and administers support for.

ii. When an employee position is open for hire, the hiring manager must notify the Network

Administrator as soon as possible by submitting the approved NSC-IT checklist. This is 
necessary in order to facilitate procuring the hardware by the employee's start date.

iii. Once an employee has passed a background check and has been formally hired, the
manager must then notify NSC-IT by submitting the approved form. Depending upon the 
needs of the position and requirements of the hiring manager, the new employee will be given 
access to the NSCAP domain. This will facilitate the creation of AD accounts, creation of a 
state email account and forwarding of the new employee's information on to other 
departments for additional program accounts to be created. Employees may be issued state 
equipment for accessing state systems. Employees will also be given access needed for web 
applications and necessary software relating to the position.

iv. State issued cellular devices are available upon the approval of the hiring manager

assuming the position is eligible for a cellular device. The phone must be requested through 
the Network Administrator or other designated Communications Coordinators authorized to 
procure through the OCIO.

v. Personal phones may have state email accounts installed on them but only after the
required form is filled out and returned to the Network Administrator, signed by the Court 
Administrator and Chief Information Officer for the state. See: NITC 5-204: Linking a Personal 
Portable Computing Device to the State Email System.

vi. Hiring managers must notify the NSC-IT department of any upcoming employee

termination/separation. For security reasons, all accounts must be immediately disabled upon 
any employee leaving his or her position. Any data that is still needed, whether email or 
network-related, must be transferred or saved by 5 p.m. on the employee's last day. For 
unplanned separations, the hiring manager must contact NSC-IT immediately.

   Access for contractors or interns must be requested by the administrator or director of the 
department under which the systems reside. An AD account and a state email account can be 
created by NSC-IT at the request of the administrator or director.

vii. Contractors / Interns

c. Network Access

i. The Network Administrator is responsible for the NSCAP domain and all servers running

within that domain. The Administrator is responsible for the daily upkeep, setup, disaster 
recovery and usage of these servers. The Administrator must be a part of any planned 
changes to the NSCAP domain, or usage of the domain by employees or third parties.

ii. The Network Administrator shall be the only one who is allowed to make programmatic
changes to the NSCAP servers unless designated otherwise by the Administrator. The NSC-
IT department is allowed to access AD for user setup and disabling user accounts along with 
creating file server shares. The NSC-IT department is also allowed to push software installs 
and updates over the NSCAP domain to its employees as needed.

iii. The Network Administrator shall utilize AD security event logs to log login and logout
times for NSCAP domain access. The Network Administrator will also be responsible for 
administering the judicial branch's Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution for all state 

purchased mobile devices.

d. Computer Access

iv. The state OCIO department is responsible for VPN creation, upkeep and usage

monitoring for all judicial branch employees, contractors and interns.

i. Only NSC devices with NSCAP user accounts shall be allowed to log onto the NSCAP
domain. No other devices will have access to shared drives or applications residing on the 
NSCAP domain or VPN access to the NSCAP domain.

ii. User accounts will use ID's of employees' first initial of their first name and their whole last

name. If this user ID is already taken, a middle initial will be used after the first initial of the 
first name. The password will conform to minimum password requirements. See NITC 8-302 
Minimum Password Configuration. NSC-IT will not override these requirements for any 
employee.

iii. All judicial branch employees with system administrative credentials and contractors must

use the state's VPN solution with dual authentication.

e. Application Access

i. All computers assigned from the NSC-IT department will have an operating system and
basic software package that will allow employees to perform all necessary job responsibilities. 
Each office shall have software to fit their specific needs.

ii. If the application is controlled by the NSC-IT department, they will furnish the username
and password and be in charge of resetting passwords. If the application is controlled by the 
individual departments, that department must appoint a person to handle usernames and 
passwords.

iii. Terminated end users must have their application access removed within 3 calendar

days by the responsible department.

V. Procurement:

a. The State Court Administrator, the State Probation Administrator or his or her designee,
has the authority to approve contracts for the purchase or lease of electronic communications 
devices, and the accompanying services under which the Administrative Office of the Courts 
and Probation is the official "customer"  to be billed. All purchases/leases of this type of 
equipment/services will be made through NSC-IT or the OCIO.

b. The judicial branch may provide employees with computer equipment and appropriate

licensed software for business use. The hiring manager is responsible for ensuring that 
purchase of any software and/or hardware for use by an employee conforms to the needs of 
the position. Hiring managers must follow procedures for requesting hardware/software 
through NSC-IT. Technology provided by the judicial branch for use in county courthouses will 
follow a set of published standards.

c. The judicial branch may provide employees with mobile devices with a data plan for use

in conducting official business outside the workplace when there is a significant business-
related reason for doing so. Hiring managers must follow procedures for requesting mobile 
devices through NSC-IT.

d. The judicial branch will only procure electronic payment services, either online or point-of-

sale, that have been approved through the State of Nebraska's contract process. These 
contracts shall ensure that the provider is fully PCI-DSS compliant and is subject to annual 
reviews of compliance status.

e. It is best practice when dealing with IT services to negotiate a Service Level Agreement
(SLA). Be sure to keep the following points in mind when negotiating the SLA. Have the SLA 
reviewed by our legal counsel.

i. Full description of all services provided

ii. Responsibilities of all parties involved

iii. Ownership of data / programing code

iv. Uptime requirements

VI. Data Protection and Destruction:

a. Network drive storage is provided for court employees with backup protection and

disaster recovery for work-related data storage.

b. All data created and or stored on state networks, computers, peripherals or otherwise is

property of the Supreme Court.

c. Any confidential or restricted data saved to the file server needs to be made a part of a
data inventory maintained by NSC-IT. Examples include Social Security numbers, individual 
health information, financial information, et cetera. See NITC 8-902 Data Classification 
Categories.

d. Restricted and confidential data should not be transferred unless encrypted.

e. Data that is past its retention period or that is no longer used or needed should be deleted
in a timely manner. Hiring managers must inform NSC-IT upon an employee's separation from 
the judicial branch on whether local data, emails, and network data can be purged, or must be 
saved to another location.

f. As physical data storage media such as hard drives, thumb drives, DVD's / CD's, et

cetera, wear out, they must be physically destroyed by NSC-IT.

VII. Employee Responsibilities:

a. It is the responsibility of all employees to follow the Information Systems and Security

Policy. All judicial branch employees must also review IT security training materials each year 
to maintain compliance.

b. All employees are responsible for being security minded when dealing with passwords,
hardware and state data. Passwords shall not be written down. Encrypted password keepers 
and training on how to use them can be provided by NSC-IT.

c. Employees should only login with their own credentials to any network or application.

Sharing of login credentials is not allowed.

d. When an employee leaves his or her desk or computer, the employee will lock the device

(Win+L).

e. An employee who is assigned technology equipment is responsible for safeguarding the
equipment and controlling its use. Any employee whose equipment is mislaid or stolen should 
immediately report the loss or theft of such equipment to his or her supervisor and to the NSC-
IT for proper incident reporting. If loss or damage of judicial branch owned equipment was 
caused by negligence on the part of the employee, the cost to replace or repair the item may 
be passed on to the employee. Upon separation from judicial branch employment, the 
employee is required to release any assigned equipment back to hiring manager or supervisor.

f. An employee who detects malware or any other compromise of the employee's device

should immediately make a report to NSC-IT for proper incident reporting.

g. Employees will ensure that all removable media checked out to them will be secured at all

times. Once an item of removable media has been used on a device not owned or leased by 
the judicial branch, it must be returned to NSC-IT for security scanning. Loss or theft of any 
item of removable media must be reported immediately to an employee's supervisor and NSC-
IT.

h. Employees/contractors must utilize VPN whenever they are not directly connected to the

state network. VPN must be used on any unsecured or public connection.

i. All judicial branch employees using state issued mobile devices must password protect
the devices with a minimum of a 4-digit pin number. Stronger types of access control such as 
a longer password, thumbprint recognition are also acceptable. Personal mobile devices used 
to access state email must also adhere to the above guidelines.

VIII. Remedial Action:

   Remedial action for a violation of this policy may include disciplinary proceedings against 
the individual or individuals responsible, including termination of employment or reporting to 
the appropriate disciplinary authority. Criminal activity performed using any judicial branch 
device or system can result in criminal investigation and/or prosecution.
