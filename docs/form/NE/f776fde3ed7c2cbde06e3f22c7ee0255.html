personal effects, training, education, and habilitating services, if no conservator has

been appointed, or requesting the conservator to expend the ward's estate by payment

to third persons to meet such expenses.

This is a limited guardianship. The Public Guardian, as guardian, shall have the following

authorities and responsibilities (acting together with the ward or singly):

Selecting the ward's place of abode within this state or with court permission, outside of 

this state;

Arranging for medical care for the ward;
