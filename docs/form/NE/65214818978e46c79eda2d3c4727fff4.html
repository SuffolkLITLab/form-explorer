education standards require on demand programs to provide a mechanism for questions to the speakers and for the content to be less than two years old 
when you obtain the education.  The Nebraska MCLE rules will be applied to the education presented here, specifically §§ 3-401.7 and 3-401.8.

, STATES AS FOLLOWS: 

I am an attorney duly licensed to practice law in the State of Nebraska, and I am familiar with the provisions of the Nebraska Supreme Court 
Rules and Neb. Rev. Ct. R. § 3-501.15, requiring: 

1) that all lawyers holding funds of clients or third persons must maintain a separate account for such funds (commonly known as
a trust account)
2) that every lawyer maintaining a trust account containing client funds of a nominal amount or held for a short period of
time must participate in the Interest On Lawyers Trust Account (IOLTA) Program unless a written Notice of Declination is
submitted to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by February 15 of the year to which the Notice of Declination will
apply
3) certain reporting and production by approved financial institutions in regard to overdrafts of trust accounts

ATTORNEYS WHO DO NOT HANDLE CLIENT FUNDS: 

I am EXEMPT from the provisions of these rules because: I do not have an office in Nebraska, I do not maintain a trust account and in 
Nebraska and I handle no funds of clients or third persons in Nebraska and do not expect to recieve of clients or third persons within the 
next twelve (12) months. I understand that if this changes at any time I am required to use the website to notify the Court of any changes. 

ATTORNEYS WHO HANDLE CLIENT FUNDS: 

I, or my firm, maintain one or more trust accounts for the deposit of funds from clients or third persons.  I will participate in the 
Interest On Lawyers Trust Accounts (IOLTA) Program for the accounts listed below that are specifically identified as IOLTA

Authorization to Financial Institutions 
IOLTA Participation:  For all accounts listed above where I have indicated "Yes" under "IOLTA," I hereby authorize such financial institution in 
which I maintain a trust account for client funds or third persons to automatically, and without further documentation, convert my trust account 
described above to an interest-bearing IOLTA account subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Supreme Court Rules.  In summary, the 
financial institution is specifically authorized and directed to remit the interest earned, less customary services or charges, to the Nebraska 
Lawyers Trust Account Foundation.  The Taxpayer Identification Number certification (IRS Form W-9 and 1099 information returns), if required, 
will show the Nebraska Lawyers Trust Account Foundation, PO Box 95103, Lincoln, NE 68509, Taxpayer I.D. No. 36-3357241, as the 
recipient of interest. 

Automatic Notice of Trust Account Overdrafts:  I hereby consent to the release by the financial institution referenced above of information

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
