 at parent and are not children in common to b
 oth parties may at the op
 tion of either party be taken into account under the guidelines in setting or modifying a ch
 ild support award, as provided in Subsection (7) . Credit may not be given if: (i) by giving credit to the obligor
 , children for whom a prior support order exists would h
 ave their child support reduced; or (ii) by giving credit to the obligee for a present family, 
 the obligation of the obligor would increase. (b) Additional worksheets shall be prepared that compute the 
 obligations of the respective parents for the additional children. The obligations shall then be subtracted from the appropriate parent's
 income before determining the 
 award in the instant case. ﬁ (7) In a proceed
 ing to adjust or modify an existing award, consideration of natural or adoptive children born after entry of the order and who are not in common to both parties may
 be applied to mitig
 ate an increase in the award but may not be applied
 : (a) for the benefit of the obligee if the credit would increase the support obligation of the obligor from the most recent order; or (b) fo
 r the benefit of the obligor if the amount of support received by the ob
 ligee would be decreased from the most recent order. ﬂ

 or the support of their child (ren) . Line 5. Calculate each parent's
 share of the amount in Line 4 as a percen
 tage figure. Line 6. Calculate each parent™s share of the amount in Line 4 as a dollar amount. 
 Line 7. This is the total number of overnights the children will 
 have with each parent. Each parent must have at least 111 overnights to qualify for Joint Physical Custody (U. C. A. 78 12 208) . Line 7 b. The rest of the calculation will be ma
 de for the parent who has the child (ren) the lesser number of overnights. So id
 entify this parent here and continue the calculation for only this parent. Line 8 a. Complete the calculation as directed. This is the math
 ematical 
 figure that will be used to reduce the base support obligation for overnights totaling between 110 to 130 [U. C. A. 78 B 12 208 (3) (a) ] . Line 8 b. Complete the calculation as directed. This is 
 the combined support obligatio
 n as a dollar figure for this parent. Line 8 c. Complete the calculation as 
 directed. This is this parent™s share of the base support obligation as a dollar figure. Line 9 a. If both parents have the child for more than 131 overnight

 overnights greater than 130 that the child (ren) have with the p
 arent who has the child (ren) the lesser number of overnights [U. C. A. 78 B 12 208 (3) (b) ] .

 nses may change the amount the obligor pays to the obligee.

 dered deviates from the guideline amount in Line 10. .
