 I ask the court to order [ ] 
 p
 etitioner [ ] 
 r
 espondent
 
 to
 
 maintain health 
 insurance for our minor children. 
 
 Both parties 
 must
 
 share equally: 
 
 
 
 the cost of the premium paid by a parent for the children's portion of 
 the insurance. The
 
 children's portion of the premium 
 should
 
 be 
 calculated by dividing the premium amount by the number of people 
 covered by the policy and multiplying the result by the number of 
 minor children of the parties; and
 
 
 
 all reasonable and necessary uninsured medic
 al and dental 
 expenses incurred for the children and paid by a parent, including 
 deductibles and co
 -
 payments. 
 
 The parent ordered to maintain insurance 
 must
 
 provide written verification of 
 coverage to the other parent or the Office of Recovery Services when
 
 the 
 children are first enrolled, on or before January 2 nd of each calendar year 
 and upon any change of insurance carrier, premium, or benefits within 30 
 calendar days after the date that parent knew or should have known of the 
 change. 
 
 If the parent ordere
 d to maintain insurance fails to provide written 
 verification of coverage to the other parent or to the Office of Recovery 
 Services, or if the parent incurring medical expenses fails to provide written 
 verification of the cost and payment of the expenses t
 o the other parent 
 within 30 days of payment
 , that parent may be denied the right to receive 
 credit for the expenses or to recover the other parent's share of the 
 expenses. 
 
 The parent receiving written verification 
 will
 
 reimburse the parent who 
 incurred t
 he medical or dental expenses one
 -
 half of the amount 
 within 30 
 days after receiving the written verification.

 I ask for this order because
