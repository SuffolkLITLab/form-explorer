 A. B. C. D. 2 
 Revised November 
 2019 
 I have received a copy of the (Amended) Information against me. I have read it, or 
 had it read to me, and I understand the nature and the elements of crime (s) to which I am 
 pleading guilty (or no contest) . 
 The elements of the crime (s) to which I am pleading guilty (or no contest) are: 
 I understand that by pleading guilty I will be
 admitting that I committed the crimes 
 listed above. (Or, if I am pleading no contest, I am not contesting that I committed the 
 foregoing crimes) . I stipulate and agree (or, if I 
 am
 pleading no contest, I do not dispute or 
 contest) that the following facts
 describe my conduct and the conduct of other persons for 
 which I am criminally liable. These facts provide a basis for the court to accept my guilty 
 
 (or no contest) plea
 (s) 
 and prove the elements of the crime (s) to which I am pleading 
 guilty (or no contest) : 
 Waiver of Constitutional Rights 
 I am entering 
 my plea (s) 
 voluntarily. I understand that I have the following rights 
 under the constitutions of Utah and of the United States. I also understand that if I plead 
 
 guilty (or no contest) I will give up all the following rights: 
 Counsel: I know that I have the right to be represented by an attorney and that if I 
 cannot afford one, 
 an
 attorney will be appointed 
 by
 the court 
 at
 no cost to 
 me. 
 I understand 
 3 Revised November 
 2019 that I might
 later, if the judge determines
 I was able, be required
 to pay
 for
 the appointed 
 lawyer™s service to
 me. 
 I (have not) (have) waived
 my right to counsel. If I have waived
 my right
 to counsel, 
 I have done so knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily for the following reasons: 
 If I have waived my right
 to counsel, I certify
 that
 I have
 read
 this statement
 and that 
 I understand
 the
 nature
 and elements
 of the charge
 (s) and crime (s) 
 to which I am pleading
 guilty (or no contest) . I also understand my rights in this case and other 
 cases and the 
 consequences of my guilty (or no contest) 
 plea (s) . 
 If I have 
 not waived my right to counsel, my
 attorney
 is . My attorney and I have fully discussed this statement, my rights, and the consequences of 
 my guilty (or no contest) 
 plea (s) . 
 Jury
 Trial. I know that I have a right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial 
 (unbiased) jury and that I will be giving up that right by pleading guilty (or no contest) . 
 Confrontation and cross
 -examination of witnesses. 
 I know that if I were to have 
 a trial, a) I would have the right to see and observe the witnesses who 
 testify
 against me 
 and b) my attorney, or myself if I waived my right to an attorney, would have the 
 opportunity to cross
 -examine all of the witnesses who
 testify
 against me. 
 Right to compel witnesses. 
 I know that if I were to have a trial, I could call 
 witnesses if I chose to, 
 and I would be able to obtain
 subpoenas
 requiring
 the attendance and 
 testimony of those witnesses. If I could not afford to pay fo
 r the witnesses to appear, the 
 State would pay those
 costs. Right to testify and privilege against self
 -incrimination. 
 I know that if I were to 
 have a trial, I would have the right to testify on my own behalf. I also know that if I chose 
 not to testify, 
 no one could
 make
 me testify
 or make
 me give evidence
 against myself. 
 I also 
 know that
 if I chose
 not to testify, 
 the
 jury
 would
 be told
 that they
 could
 not hold my refusal 
 to testify against
 me. 
 Presumption
 of innocence
 and
 burden
 of proof. 
 I know that
 if I do not plead guilty 
 (or no contest) , 
 I am presumed
 innocent until the
 State proves
 that I am guilty
 of the charged 
 crime (s) . 
 If I choose to fight
 the charges against
 me, 
 I need
 only
 plead ﬁnot guilty, ﬂ
 and my 
 case
 will be set for
 a trial. 
 At a trial, the State
 would have the burden
 of proving each
 4 Revised November 
 2019 element of the charge (s) beyond a reasonable doubt. If the trial is before a jury, the verdict 
 must be unanimous, meaning each juror would have to find me guilty. 
 I understand that if I plead guilty (or no contest) , I give up the presumption of 
 innocence and will be admitting that I committed the crime (s) stated above. 
 Appeal. 
 I know that under the Utah Constitution, if I were convicted by a jury or 
 judge, I would
 have the right to appeal
 my conviction
 and sentence. 
 If I could not afford
 the costs of an
 appeal, the State
 would pay
 those
 costs
 for
 me. 
 I understand
 I am
 giving
 up my
 right to appeal
 my conviction
 if I plead guilty
 (or no contest) . 
 I understand
 if I wish to 
 appeal my sentence I must file a notice of appeal within 30 days after my sentence is 
 entered. I know and understand that by pleading guilty (
 or no contest) , 
 I am waiving 
 and giving up
 all the statutory and constitutional rights as explained
 above. Consequences of Entering a Guilty (or No Contest) Plea
 Potential penalties. 
 I know the maximum sentence that may be imposed for each 
 crime to which I am pleading guilty (or no contest) . I know that by pleading guilty (or no 
 contest) to a crime tha
 t carries a mandatory penalty, I will be subjecting myself to serving 
 a mandatory
 penalty
 for
 the crime. 
 I know my sentence may
 include
 a prison term, 
 fine, 
 or both. I know that in addition to a fine, 
 a ninety
 percent
 (90%) surcharge
 will
 be imposed
 . I also know that I may be ordered to make restitution to any victim (s) of my crime
 (s) , including any restitution that may be owed on charges that are dismissed as part of a plea 
 agreement. 
 Consecutive/concurrent
 prison
 terms. 
 I know
 that if there is more
 than
 one crime 
 involved, the sentences
 may
 be imposed
 one after
 another (consecutively) , 
 or they
 may
 run at the same time (concurrently) . I know I may be charged an additional fine for each 
 crime
 I plead
 to. I also
 know if I am on probation
 or parole, 
 or awaiting
 sentencing on 
 another offense of which I have been convicted 
 or to which I have pled guilty (or no 
 contest) , my guilty (or no contest) plea (s) now may result in consecutive sentences being 
 imposend on me. If the offense to which I am now plead
 ing guilty occurred when I was 
 imprisoned or on parole, 
 I know
 the law requires
 the court to impose
 consecutive
 sentences 
 unless the court finds and states on the record that consecutive sentences would be 
 inappropriate. 
 Plea agreement. 
 My guilty (or no c
 ontest) plea (s) (is/are) (is/are not) the result of 
 a plea agreement
 between
 myself
 and the prosecuting attorney.

 5 Revised November

 if any, 
 are fully
 contained

 statement, 
 including
 those explained below:

 recommendation of probation or suspended sentence, including a reduction of the charges 
 for
 sentencing, made

 defense
 counsel or the prosecuting
 attorney

 binding on the judge. I also know that any opinions they express to me as to what they 
 believe the judge may do are not binding on the
 judge. Immigration/Deportation:

 or even
 will, subject
 me
 to deportation under United
 States immigration 
 laws and regulations, or otherwise adversely affect my immigration status, which may 
 include permanently barring my re
 -entry into the United States. I understand tha
 t if I have

 Revised November 
 2019 
 mental disease, defect, or impairment that would prevent me from understanding what I 
 am doing or from knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entering my plea (s) . 
 I understand
 that if I 
 want
 to 
 withdraw
 my guilty (or 
 no
 contest) plea (s) , I 
 must

 DEFENDANT 
 Certificate of Defense Attorney 
 I certify that I am the attorney for 
 , the defendant 
 above, and that I know he/she has 
 read
 the statement or that I have read it to him/her; I have 
 discussed it with him/her and believe that he/she fully understands the meaning of its 
 
 contents and is mentally and physically competent. To the best of 
 my knowledge and belief, 
 after an appropriate investigation, the elements of the crime (s) and the factual synopsis of 
 
 the defendant™s criminal conduct are correctly stated; and these, along with the other 
 
 representations and declarations made 
 by the defendant in the foregoing 
 statement, 
 are 
 accurate and
 true. 
 ATTORNEY FOR DEFENDANT 
 Bar No. 
 7 
 Revised November 
 2019 
 Certificate of Prosecuting Attorney 
 I certify that I 
 am the attorney for the 
 State
 of Utah in the 
 case
 against 
 , defendant. I have reviewed this Statement of Defendant 
 and find that the factual basis of the defendant™s criminal conduct which constitutes the 
 offense (s) is true and correct. No improper inducements, threats, or coercion to encourage 
 a plea has 
 been
 offered defendant. The plea negotiations are fully contained in the Statement 
 and in the attached Plea Agreement or as supplemented on the record before the Court. 
 There is reasonable cause to believe that the evidence would support the conviction of 
 defendant for the offense (s) for which the plea (s) is/are entered and that the acceptance of 
 the plea (s) would serve the public interest.

 Bar No.
