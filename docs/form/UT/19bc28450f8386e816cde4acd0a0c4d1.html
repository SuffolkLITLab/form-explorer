SUBSTANTIATION PROCEEDINGS: 
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PETITIONER 
 

Substantiation proceedings are governed by Utah Code 63G-4-402(2), and 78A-6-323.  If you 
have any questions not addressed in these instructions, refer to the Utah Code. You should be able to 
locate a copy on the State Court Website at https://www.utcourts.gov/ (for procedural rules), or the 
Legislature=s Website at https://le.utah.gov/Documents/code_const.htm (for the Utah Code). 

HOW TO FILE FOR A HEARING  

.  FILING SUIT. You are the >PETITIONER= in this case and the >RESPONDENT= is  
the Division of Child and Family Services.  If the judge determines that the finding of the Division of 
Child and Family Services is Aunsubstantiated@ or Awithout merit@ as defined in Utah Code 62A-4a-
101, the judge will order that your name be removed from the Licensing Information System.  In this 
action,  no  claims  can  be  made  for  money.    The  Juvenile  Court  has  exclusive  jurisdiction  over 
substantiation  proceedings  to  make  a  finding  of  Asubstantiated@,  Aunsubstantiated@,  or  Awithout 
merit@.  If the court finds that Division of Child and Family Services claim is unsubstantiated, or 
without merit, the Court will order Division of Child and Family Services to remove your name from 
the Licensing Database.   

.  COURT HEARING. You must prepare the Petition, sign it in the presence of a 

notary public or court clerk, have your signature notarized, file it with the court clerk, and pay the 
filing fee listed on the petition cover sheet.  The Petition should be typewritten, but will be accepted 
if legibly handwritten.  

he clerk will set two hearing dates (pre-trial, and adjudicatory hearing) and give you a copy of the 
Petition with the hearing dates on it. The first hearing will be a pre-trial hearing, and is intended for 
parties to inform the court of the legal and factual issues to be presented at the adjudicatory hearing.  
Any stipulations or agreements between the parties should be presented at the pre-trial hearing. The 
second hearing, the adjudicatory hearing, is a trial to resolve all of the legal and factual issues.    

f you fail to appear at the hearing, your case may be dismissed Awith prejudice@ and you may 
not be able to re-file your claim.  

n  compliance  with  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  individuals  needing  special 
accommodations  (including  auxiliary  communicative  aids  and  services)  during  this  proceeding 
should call the court clerk at least three working days prior to the proceeding.  
   

3. 

SERVICE.  Once you receive hearing dates from the court, it is your responsibility to 
serve notice of the hearings on the Division of Child and Family Services.  The Petition must be 
served on the Division of Child and Family Services at least 45 calendar days before the adjudicatory 
hearing.  You cannot serve the petition yourself.  Service can be made in one of two ways: 
 

a) MAIL (with proof of receipt).  Mail a copy of the Petition to the Division of

Child  and  Family  Services  by  registered  or  certified  mail  with  return  receipt 
requested to be signed by an agent of the Division of Child and Family Services 
authorized to accept service.  If you serve the Respondent by mail, you must fill out 
and file with the court the Proof of Service (Form B).  The Proof of Service Form 
must be filed with the court within 10 calendar days of service and must have the 
original receipt signed by the Respondent attached. 

b) DELIVERY.  Have the Petition served on the Division of Child and Family Services 
by the Sheriff's department, a Constable, or any person regularly engaged in the business 
of serving process, and pay for the service.  You will need to make sure the Petition has 
been served and proof of the service has been filed with the Court Clerk. 

.  POSTPONING  THE  ADJUDICATORY  HEARING.    If  you  want  to  change  an 
adjudicatory hearing date, you must request a AContinuance.@  The judge is not obligated to grant you 
a continuance.  Fill out the Request for Continuance form available at the court.  You must serve a 
copy of your request for a continuance on the Division of Child and Family Services (see instructions 
for AService@ above).  The court may grant your request if both parties agree, or for good cause.  The 
court must receive your Request for Continuance at least five calendar days before the hearing.   

.  EVIDENCE  AND  WITNESSES.  Bring  with  you  to  the  adjudicatory  hearing  all 
witnesses and papers necessary to prove your claim or defense. If you fail to do this, the case 
may be decided against you.   No later than 30 days prior to the adjudicatory hearing, the parties 
shall  provide  to  each  other  information  they  will  rely  upon  to  support  their  claim  or  defense.  
Irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence will be excluded.  Evidence should be offered through the 
statements of live witnesses at the adjudicatory hearing, or as otherwise permitted by the Utah Rules 
of Evidence.   

f you need the testimony of a witness who will not attend the adjudicatory hearing voluntarily, 
you should ask the court or your attorney to issue a Subpoena (Form C) requiring that person to 
attend. It is your responsibility to have the Subpoena served and to pay the witness fee and service 
fee.  A subpoena must be served at least 5 calendar days before the adjudicatory hearing. You may 
have  a  witness  appear  voluntarily  without  a  subpoena,  but  the  judge  will  not  continue  the 
adjudicatory hearing if the witness fails to appear. 

.   FINDINGS AND APPEAL.  At the conclusion of the adjudicatory hearing, the judge will 
make a finding that the determination of abuse or neglect is substantiated, unsubstantiated, or 
without merit.  Either party may appeal the findings within 30 calendar days before the Utah Court 
of Appeals.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROOF OF SERVICE OF PETITION 

If you served notice of hearing  by mail, you must prove that the Division of Child and Family 
Services received notice at least 45 calendar days before the adjudicatory hearing.  By filing proof of 
service  with  the  court,  you  may  be  able  to  get  a  default  judgment  if  the  representatives  of  the 
Division of Child and Family Services do not appear for the hearing. 

he Proof of Service (Form B) must be filed with the court within 10 days of service. To do so, you 
must provide the document (not a copy) signed by the other party indicating receipt.  The document 
must show the date that the Division of Child and Family Services received the  Petition.  This 
document must be attached to the bottom left corner of the Proof  of  Service form in a way that still 
allows anything under the document to be seen (for example, staple only along left margin).  If the 
document covers more than half the page, attach document to 8 x 11 paper and staple behind Proof 
of Service.  The Respondent must sign the document indicating receipt.   

If you choose to serve the Affidavit or Counter Affidavit by mail, and do not show the court 
that the other party got the required notice, you will not be able to get a default judgment if 
the other party does not appear for trial.
