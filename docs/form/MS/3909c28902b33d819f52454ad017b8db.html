MISSISSIPPI RULES FOR ELECTRONIC AND PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERAGE 
OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS 

[The Mississippi Rules for Electronic and Photographic Coverage of Judicial Proceedings 
are adopted effective April 17, 2003 for proceedings conducted from and after July 1, 2003.] 

 

 

 

 

 

RULE  1.    GENERAL.    Electronic  media  coverage  of  judicial  proceedings  in 
Mississippi  Courts  shall  be  governed  by  the  following  rules.  These  rules  apply  to  the 
Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, chancery courts, circuit courts, and county courts and may 
be cited as MREPC.  

   

 

 

 

 

 

RULE 2.  DEFINITION.
 
 

(a)   “Media” shall mean all persons and organizations engaging in news gathering or 
reporting and includes any newspaper, radio or television station or network, news service, 
magazine,  trade  paper,  professional  journal,  and  other  news  reporting  or  news  gathering 
agencies. 

 

 

(b)  "Electronic media coverage" and "electronic coverage" shall mean any reporting, 
recording, broadcasting, narrowcasting, cablecasting, and webcasting of court proceedings 
by the media using television, radio, photographic, recording, or other electronic device. 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) “Judicial proceedings” shall mean any trial, pre-trial hearings,post-trial hearings 

and appellate arguments. 

RULE 3.  ELECTRONIC MEDIA COVERAGE ALLOWED. Electronic media 
coverage of public judicial proceedings shall be allowed in the appellate and trial courts of 
record  in this state subject to the conditions below. The presiding justice or judge has the 
discretion to limit or terminate electronic coverage at any time during the proceedings if the 
court deems such necessary and in the interest of justice to protect the rights of the parties 
or witnesses, or the dignity of the court, or to assure orderly conduct of the proceedings. 

 

 

 

(a)  Authority of presiding justice or judge.  All electronic coverage is 
subject at all time to the authority of the presiding justice or judge to (i) control 
the conduct of the proceedings, (ii) ensure decorum and prevent distraction, 
and (iii) ensure fair administration of justice in the pending case.  The rights 
of  the  parties  to  a  fair  adjudication  are  recognized  as  paramount.    It  is  the 
responsibility of the media to so arrange and operate equipment in order to 
comply with these rules. 

(b) Persons other than media representatives.  These rules do not allow 
the  use  of  electronic  devices  by  attorneys  and  persons  other  than  media 
representatives except as may be allowed by the court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Coverage of certain matters prohibited.  Electronic coverage of the 
following matters is expressly prohibited unless the presiding justice or judge 
shall  allow  the  coverage  by  order:  divorce;  child  custody;  support; 
guardianship;  conservatorship;  commitment;  waiver  of  parental  consent  to 
abortion;  adoption;  delinquency  and  neglect  of  minors;  determination  of 
paternity; termination of parental rights; domestic abuse; motions to suppress 
evidence; proceedings involving trade secrets; and in camera proceedings. 

 

 

 

 

(d) Coverage of certain persons prohibited.  Electronic coverage of the 
following categories of witnesses is expressly prohibited: police informants, 

 

minors, undercover agents, relocated witnesses, victims and families of victims 
of sex crimes, and victims of domestic abuse. 

RULE 4.  RESTRICTIONS. 

 

 

(a) The location of equipment and personnel necessary for electronic 
media  coverage  of  judicial  proceedings  shall  be  at  a  place  either  inside  or 
outside the courtroom so as to be minimally intrusive to the proceedings. Only 
equipment  which  does  not  produce  distracting  sound  or  light  shall  be 
employed to cover judicial proceedings. No flash or strobe lighting shall be 
used.  All running wires shall be securely taped to the floor. No other artificial 
lighting device of any kind shall be employed in connection with electronic 
coverage unless otherwise authorized by the court.  Matters covered by this 
sub-part are subject to the discretion of the presiding judge and may be relaxed 
 
so long as the coverage does not result in distraction of the proceedings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) No members or potential members of the jury may be recorded or 
shown at any time prior to their dismissal, nor shall the jury selection process 
be  subject  to  electronic  coverage.  The  presiding  judge  shall  inform  all 
potential jurors at the beginning of the jury selection process of the restrictions 
of this particular provision. 

 

 

 

 

(c)  No audio recording is permitted of off-the-record conferences in the 
courtroom between the court and counsel, or between counsel and co-counsel, 
or between counsel and clients or witnesses. 

 

 

(d) Judicial proceedings held in chambers and proceedings generally 

 

 

 

closed to the public shall not be subject to electronic coverage. 

(e) Electronic media equipment shall not be taken into the courtroom, 
relocated,  or  removed  from  the  designated  media  area  except  prior  to 
convening of the  judicial proceedings, during recesses, and after adjournment 
for  the  day.    This  prohibition  shall  not  apply  to  small,  handheld  electronic 
devices. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Unless otherwise allowed by the presiding judge, no  more than one 
television camera or video recorder, one audio system for radio broadcasting, 
and  one  still  photographer  shall  be  allowed  in  any    judicial  proceeding.  If 
pooling arrangements are employed, such data or information is to be available 
equally to all pool participants, and the pool representative shall charge no fees 
or expenses to the other pool participants.  The pool representative is not to be 
given any economic or coverage advantage over the other pool participants. 
Any pooling arrangements among the media required by these limitations on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equipment and personnel shall be the sole responsibility of the media without 
calling upon the presiding justice or judge to mediate any dispute as to the 
appropriate media representative or equipment authorized to cover a particular 
proceeding.  In  the  absence  of  advance  media  agreement  on  disputed 
equipment or personnel issues, the presiding justice or judge shall exclude all 
contesting media personnel from a proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the Chief Judge of the 
Court  of  Appeals  may  waive  these  restrictions  with  respect  to  judicial 
proceedings in the Supreme Court and in the Court of Appeals, respectively. 

 

 

 

 

[Amended effective December 9, 2004 to give the presiding judge discretion as to application 
of technical limitations of coverage; amended effective September 29, 2005.] 

RULE 5.  NOTICE.  Media representatives who propose  to engage in electronic 
coverage of a  judicial  proceeding shall notify the clerk and the court administrator of the 
court  of  such  intention  at  least  forty-eight  (48)  hours  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the 
proceeding.    The  presiding  justice  or  judge  may    shorten  or  waive  the  time  for  advance 
notice. 

 

RULE 6.  DECORUM.  The decorum and dignity of the court, the courtroom, and 
the judicial  proceedings must be maintained at all times.  Court customs shall be followed 
including appropriate attire.  Movement in the courtroom during the proceedings shall be 
limited and may be completely prohibited except during breaks or recesses.  Disruption of 
proceedings will not be permitted. 

  

 

 

 

 

RULE 7.  OBJECTIONS.  Any party may object to electronic coverage by written 
motion, which may be supported by affidavits.  Such motions shall be filed no later than 
fifteen (15) days prior to  commencement of the judicial  proceedings, unless good cause 
 
exists to shorten the time for filing. 

 

 

  

RULE  8.  IMPERMISSIBLE USE OF  MATERIAL.  No material gathered by 
 
electronic media shall be part of the official court record of the judicial proceedings covered 
unless admitted into evidence.  The official court record of any  judicial proceeding is the 
transcript of the original notes and all exhibits introduced into evidence in the proceeding. 

RULE 9.  ENFORCEMENT AND SANCTIONS.  A violation of these rules may 

  
be sanctioned by measures deemed appropriate by the court. 

 

 

 

RULE 10.  EXPIRATION–DELETED 
  

Rule 10, providing for expiration of the Rules for Electronic and Photographic Coverage of 

 

Judicial Proceedings on December 31, 2004 was repealed effective December 9, 2004. 

[Adopted effective April 17, 2003 for proceedings occurring from July 1, 2003; amended to 
remove expiration date, December 9, 2004.] 

 

 

Comment 

Section 3B(12) of the Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits broadcasting, televising, 
recording, or taking photographs in the courtroom and areas immediately adjacent thereto 
except as authorized by rule or order of the Supreme Court. Also, Rule 1.04 of the Uniform 
Rules of Circuit and County Court allows cameras only “in accordance with the Code of 
Judicial Conduct.”  Thus, electronic coverage is allowed only for special purposes authorized 
in Section 3B(12), or under these Rules for Electronic and Photographic Coverage of Judicial 
Proceedings (MREPC.) 

 

 

 

 

 

The  MREPC  recognize  that  the  use  of  cameras,  television,  broadcast,  and  other 
electronic media to cover court proceedings presents special considerations unique to their 
use.    In  addressing  these  considerations,  the  rule  recognizes  both  that  in  certain  public 
 
proceedings such coverage can be intimidating and unnecessarily intrusive into the lives of 
citizens,  even  where  there  is  no  expectation  of  privacy,  and  that  these  special  logistical 
problems are attendant to the use of new technologies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In MREPC 2(b), “electronic media coverage” and “electronic coverage” are defined 

 

 
to include the use of still cameras. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

The  MREPC  neither  limit  nor  expand  the  authority  of  law  for  general  closing  of 
proceedings, the general exclusion of the public and the media from the courtroom, or the 
sealing of documents.  These broader limitations on public access areas are addressed  in the 
Constitution and statutes of the state as well as the decisions of the courts.  Article 3, Section 
 
26 of the Mississippi Constitution provides that the court may in certain specified cases, in 
its discretion, exclude from the courtroom all persons except such as are necessary in the 
conduct of the trial.  Examples of proceedings for which statutes either mandate or permit 
closed hearings include certain divorce proceedings (Miss. Code Ann. §93-5-21), those for 
waiver  of  parental  consent  to  an  abortion  for  a  minor  (Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  41-41-55), 
proceedings raising the sexual conduct of a complaining witness in a rape case (Miss. Code. 
Ann. § 97-3-68), and Youth Court Proceedings (Miss. Code Ann. § 43-21-203).  The closing 
of proceedings generally and procedures for notice and hearing prior to closing are addressed 
in Gannett River States Pub. Co. v. Hand, 571 So. 2d 941 (Miss. 1990) and In re Memphis 
Publishing Company, 823 So. 2d 1150 (Miss. 2001).

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
