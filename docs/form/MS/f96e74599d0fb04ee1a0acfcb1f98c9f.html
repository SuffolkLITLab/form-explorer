      <pre>MISSISSIPPI SUPREME COURT

Adopted by Administrative Order on August 27, 2008.

Statement of Policy Regarding Openness and Availability of Public Records

1.

Introduction

Access to public records in the judiciary is consistent with the Court’s policy that the
public interest is best served by open courts and by an independent judiciary consistent with
the mandates of the Mississippi Constitution.  The State of Mississippi has established a
policy concerning access to public records, as set forth in the Mississippi Public Records Act.
Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-1.  The judiciary of the State of Mississippi, as a separate and equal
branch of the government, is not subject to the Mississippi Public Records Act. 

While public records are made available as readily and conveniently as possible, not
all records under the control of the Court are public records.  This Statement of Policy is not
intended  to  declare  whether  particular  records  are  public,  nor  is  it  intended  to  include  a
comprehensive list of those records exempt from public access.

2.

The Supreme Court and Court of Appeals

The  Supreme  Court  and  Court  of  Appeals  speak  through  their  rulings,  orders,
judgments and opinions which are routinely available to the public in the office of the Clerk
of the Court, on-line at http://www.courts.ms.gov,  and through  commercially available
publications. Such rulings, orders, judgments and opinions are based on the record from the
trial  court,  briefs  and  other  filings  of  the  parties  on  matters  before  the  Court  which  are
maintained by the Clerk of the Court and available to the public as set out in paragraph 3,
below.  All information utilized in furtherance of the business of the Courts, including but not
limited to, information used in the development of orders, judgments and opinions, is non-
public and is exempt and excepted from disclosure.  

3.

Supreme Court Clerk’s Office

Records, which are subject to inspection, are maintained by the Clerk of the Court and
are open to the general public for inspection and copying during regular business hours: 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m., except for legal holidays.   A record is a document, paper, letter, map, book, tape,
photograph,  film,  recording  or  other  material,  regardless  of  electronic  or  physical  form,
characteristics or means of transmission.    

This policy does not require the Clerk to retain a record for a specific period of time
or  to  allow  the  inspection  of  or  provide  a  copy  of  information  contained  in  a  book  or

publication that is commercially or otherwise available to the public.  

Copy work is subject to the following fees:

         Order from Minute Book
         Regular copying
         Copying from bound volumes or records
         Copy of mandate

$5.00
    .50/page
$2.00/page
$3.00

Requests are filled upon receipt of payment.  The Clerk’s telephone number is 601-
359-3694.    The  mailing  address  is    Post  Office  Box  249,  Jackson,  MS  39205-0249.
Information may also be available on-line at  http://www. courts.ms.gov.

Excepted from this policy are records declared closed to the public by court order and
any documents filed under seal, pursuant to Rule 48A of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate
Procedure, and any record that is confidential or exempt from disclosure under state or federal
law.  

4.

Administrative Office of Courts

Statistics collected by the Administrative Office of Courts (AOC) are incorporated in 
the  Supreme  Co urt  Annual  Report.    The  report  i s  available  on-line  at  http://www. 
courts.ms.gov.    Customized  requests  ar e  subject  to  the  AOC’s  staff  availability  and 
resources.    Informati on  requests  and  copy  work  are  subject  t o  fees  and  are  done  on  an 
as-time-permits  basis.    A  record  shall  be  provided  in  the  format  requested  if  the  AOC 
maintains the record in that format.  This policy does no t require the AOC to create a record, 
other t han to print informati on already stor ed in its computer.  A records cus todian may deny 
a record request that would substantially and unreasonably i mpede the routine operation of 
the  court  or  judicial  agency.  The  AO C  also  provides  a  s ubscriber  service  for  criminal 
background checks, civil filings and statistical information.  Customized search requests m ay 
be made, in writing, to t he Administrative Office of C ourts, Post Office Box 117,  Jackson,

MS 39215. 

6. 

Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration 

The  Department  of  Finance  and  Administration  (DFA)  maintains  financial  and
administrative records of the Court.  All record requests should be submitted in writing to the
Public Information Officer, Department of Finance & Administration, 501 North West Street
Jackson, MS 39201. Requests may be mailed, hand delivered, transmitted via facsimile at
(601) 359-3402, or via email at publicinformation@dfa.state.ms.us. For more information,
visit the DFA website: http://www.dfa.state.ms.us/publicinfopolicy.pdf

7. 

Record Requests 

The response will be made not more than 14 days after the actual receipt of a written
request and payment of applicable charges.  The time for inspection or delivery of copies will
be as soon as practicable.  All record requests must comply with the specific directions set out
for each subdivision of the courts and judicial agencies,  and payment of all applicable charges
must be received before the time for response begins to run.   

8. 

Denial of Access and Appeal. 

A  records  custodian  may  deny  a  record  request  that  would  substantially  and
unreasonably  impede  the  routine  operation  of  the  court  or  judicial  agency.  By  way  of
illustration, the records custodian may decline a request for “all judicial records” or other such
requests that could substantially and unreasonably impede the operations of a court or judicial
agency.

A  records  custodian  may  also  deny  a  written  request  for  a  record  if  the  custodian
reasonably determines that the requested record is exempt from required disclosure under this
policy.  The records custodian may make  specific, non-conclusory findings that compliance
with the request would substantially and unreasonably impede the routine operation of the
court or judicial agency. 

Other  records  exempt  from  disclosure  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  records
concerning  security  plans,  procedures  or  locations  of  offices;  personnel  or  any  other
information reflecting a person’s home address, home or personal telephone number, social
security number or family members.

3

A  records  custodian  who  denies  a  written  record  request  must  notify  the  person
requesting the record of the denial within a reasonable time– not to exceed 14 days –after
written notice of the request and receipt of payment for applicable charges.  A notice of denial
must state the reason for the denial.  A person who is denied access to a record may appeal
within 14 days of the date of notice of denial by filing a written request for review with the
Supreme Court Administrator,  Post Office Box 117, Jackson, MS 39205-0117.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
